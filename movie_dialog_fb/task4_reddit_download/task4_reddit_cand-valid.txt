1 MORTAL KOMBAT !

1 Some of us are attracted to cuteness instead of sexiness . I could n't care less for Angelina Jolie or Megan Fox , but Jenna-Louise Coleman is the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen

1 Fair enough .

1 Just reading `` Wilhelm scream '' makes me hear it in my head now

1 I always thought that would have been better had they not advertised it as a horror movie and advertised it as more of the dystopian action movie it was .

1 I Second Dark City . Not really heavy and the ending is quite goofy but definitely explored deep questions . A rather underrated movie .

1 Brilliant .

1 I agree Forrest Whitaker 's performance in The Last King of Scotland is simply superb .

1 i wholeheartedly disagree . He did he a really good job of editing it in a way in which it looked like they where dancing in time with the song . Also the song is only a couple of minutes long , and that means making any of the clips longer he would have had to cut some of them out .

1 It most certainly did . Kubrick likely gave input , but there 's no way he set all of that up himself .

1 No teaser . It 's a full 2.33 minute trailer .

1 All work and low pay makes Jack a dull boy .

1 Coziest . Movie . Ever !

1 I can see that , the ambient soundtrack combined with how quiet everyone is in the first half could definitely lull me to sleep .

1 Upset ? I think not .

1 You 're disgusting .

1 OMG agreed ! Jake Lloyd really is the Pacino of our generation , and those movies really flew under the radar .

1 Love Rabin 's work -- so happy when The Dissolve picked him up .

1 I feel I would watch the movie more if it were n't for this one scene .

1 Burton seems to have fallen in love with his own reputation for wierd stuff . Everyone told him that his movies needed to be warped and strange , and he believed them . Tell him they need to be normal and you get the right amount of strange .

1 While I appreciate everything you said , I only upvoted you for the last line

1 Sam Mendes is very deliberate about this kind of stuff . You can see it in Road to Perdition , too .

1 aka reddit

1 It is true . I liked the film quite a bit , but it definitely could have been better . Everyone says to just ignore the plot holes because it 's so over the top , but it could have been more believable without losing any of it 's larger than life aspects .

1 Plagiarism should be vilified , yes . It 's outright stealing , and trying to profit from someone 's hard work . I 'm not saying Shia should be vilified , but people need to stop acting like plagiarism is no big deal .

1 OPs comments have made it clear he is trying to put down boyhood though .

1 The problem is that the extras are spread around multiple releases and to get all of the extras typically included on release , you have to purchase from 4 different venues . How can you call yourself a collector if you do n't understand the value of the extras ...

1 YES . I do n't think there 's enough discussion about the socioeconomic decline of Detroit being central to the film . Socio-economic decline usually leads to sexual irresponsibility - which I interpret as the main theme of the film .

1 Or because the joke flew over your head ?

1 Garfield has the Spiderman aspect locked down , but I 'd say Tobey played a damn good Peter . He was a much more realistic Peter than Garfield .

1 Natural 20 .

1 This is n't trees .

1 Dear Total Film : Stop making sixty page web articles . Condense like like 5 into one so it 's only 12 pages . Rotten Tomatoes has already done this , please follow suit .

1 I have not , but I have seen the original Buffy movie . I 'm counting things that he had actual directorial control or influence over , not things that he wrote and then were bastardized by someone else .

1 Great examples of quality cross examination .

1 Got a big shot over here . Kill Bill is better than the majority of the Shaw bros films . They 're better pure kung fu but that 's not what Kill Bill was .

1 He does n't feel every force being . This is why he never got Yoda in the end . He and vader have a bond as master and apprentice and he maintains special interest in his apprentice ( the future of the sith empire ) . If you want to go into the books several other force users are born and exist in the galaxy and he does n't maintain knowledge of them either .

1 * Gasp * , * Fart *

1 I thought he did pretty well all things considered . And the decriminalization of cannabis at the end of his governorship made me tip my hat toward the man .

1 Hmmmm , will he be hot in a frock , or just creepy ?

1 Huh ? It 's clearly aimed at people who play a lot of video games . Not to say you ca n't enjoy it if you do n't play video games , but there 's a number of references you 'd miss if you do n't .

1 And one of the trailers too . He 's not a robot , but he gets enhanced / taken over by the robots and is a villain or something . I know this from their marketing materials and it 's shit like that that I 'd rather find out from actually watching the movie ( which I feel like I 've already done ) .

1 Upvoted for a reference there is no way I would ever have gotten otherwise .

1 Trying to get to White Castle .

1 you mean ... .Patrick ... ..Swwwwwaaayyyyzzzeeee

1 How many other films are there that look like actual paintings ? Just incredible .

1 Just the other day . Eh .

1 ... how much do you want ?

1 it was like they insited on using the shitty CGI alien and then realized it cost to much so they just did a bunch of terrible POV shots

1 I hope this is n't a joke cause their shows are fucking awesome . FTFY

1 Eh , somewhat . I 'm just a dog lover who remembers the 4th grade and thinking it was cruel to put a innocent dog in space to die for science !

1 NC-17 is the higher rating , R is the milder rating . So you just answered your own question why a film that involved smoking coke out of a strippers ass , broke the swear word record and has lengthy sex scenes was given a rating that meant kids ca n't enter to watch it .

1 [ Your down-vote for your equally shitty account . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / jnGbf.png )

1 Then why did n't you post them before ?

1 I tried watching Zardoz once . It was just depressing . That cloney finger movie sounds great , though .

1 Loved it and would really love to see Dano and Gyllenhall get supporting Oscar noms for it . I would talk more about it but I hate typing on my phone . Second favorite movie of 2013 in a year full of pretty great stuff .

1 If this movie had a smell , it would be the underarms of puberty . And I 'm not saying the movie is bad . I liked it . But I just imagine that smell with it .

1 He grew up in a cult .

1 As cringe as that series was , it was a damn good marketing plan .

1 The trailer was n't so much `` terrible '' as it was kitschy . It looked like an incredibly typical low budget action flick ( and I suppose that 's basically was , but a fairly well made one ) , and unless you 're just really into over the top action films the trailer and marketing left * much * to be desired .

1 I remember sitting in the theater and when they push her over the boat so uneventfully . I was so crushed , again subverting my expectations on what would happen in any other typical movie of this genre .

1 It seems like that all boils down to `` Unrealistic expectations . ''

1 The 1998 Zilla movie did the same thing

1 Mario ? Is that you ?

1 YOU TURNED THE CIRCLEJERK AGAINST MEEEE

1 Woah is this a bad post

1 I think its getting a wider release next week ? I just came back from seeing it , I was totally charmed . I like stuff like this , but it was better than I thought it would be and hilarious in some unexpected ways .

1 After this line , I just thought to myself , is he really the villain ?

1 It 's like a bloody rugby ball !

1 r / movies , ladies and gentlemen

1 > What is the opinion on Malick here ? It 's pretty much where it is everywhere else , either you find him a genius artist or the most pretentious director on the planet . I believe in the former .

1 Literally no one has said that .

1 Yeah , I think that 's true , but it seems more indicative of how action is shown in general these days . I thought the action sequences in MI3 were well done .

1 Well that 's the first act .

1 Not even his shield .

1 Spoiler : He 's dead and the trees did it .

1 I watched the trailer without realizing there was a spoiler / twist in it . To me it really did not do much `` spoiling '' . However others have also said it is nothing that you can not miss out on so if you are really concerned do n't watch it .

1 For his genre , Mike Judge

1 And a broach , a pterodactyl !

1 yeah that 's what happening those day , you put some `` pretty images '' on hollow stories and subjects and it 's suddenly turns `` so damn brilliant ''

1 Yep , good practical effects stand up waaaay better than CGI .

1 Well , there the various hentai of game and anime characters : )

1 [ You may appreciate this . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=YPSgDCoyljI )

1 Yeah but he at least had a pivotal role . I mean how much screen time did the Emperor have in the entire original trilogy ? It was still a big deal when he got killed though .

1 Won the best actress Oscar for it IIRC ...

1 Put zat COOKIE DOWN ! ! ! ! NOW ! ! !

1 Yes . Fantastic acting on both sides and so disturbing .

1 > Not watching this film : 2 years , Iso-Cubes .

1 Blue ?

1 Power outage is not the same thing as a security breach .

1 In Brazil , the tale `` Hansel and Gretel '' is called `` Joao e Maria '' .

1 A long time ago , I was part of the test audience for David Cronenberg 's `` eXistenz '' .

1 These are film critics . What would you like them to do ? Withhold their opinion ? That 's kind of their whole purpose .

1 yeah i 'm getting a bit sick of him whinging about the shakey cam . get over it you old man .

1 I just realized the apes are wearing clothes ! Hahaha , they think they are people ! ! !

1 Oops . Thanks !

1 > Electric Dreams I recently saw this film , which is still [ on Youtube ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=jKRM5ifCXgc ) . If there 's something tech and 80 's , than it 's this film . With a young Virginia Madsen and Lenny von Dohlen , the orchid guy from Twin Peaks .

1 Obviously you 're not a golfer .

1 Because at least with pure darkness you can light your way through . What happens when it is dark and your vision is clouded with thick mist and fog ? Good luck .

1 It 's referred to as the shaggin wagon

1 Exactly . My uncle was enamored with her even while he was in the middle of a heated argument with her . She is a talented and charming person who has done a lot of great work , but that does n't exempt her for trying to steamroll my uncle .

1 > Fincher turned it in to an action flick starring James Fucking Bond It 's a thriller , not an action movie . The book was pretty much the literary equivalent of a thriller , so Fincher got that right . > the book is about a middle aged editor whose greatest gifts are his mind and charm Daniel Craig was about 41 when they made that movie , so he was in the right age range . Not to mention he gave a much better performance in the role than Michael Nyqvist did .

1 Mouth just has next level translation skills .

1 They 're working titles > A working title , sometimes called a production title , is the temporary name of a product or project used during its development , usually used in filmmaking , television production , novel , video game , or music album . > Working titles are used primarily for two reasons-the first being that an official title has not yet been decided upon and the working title is being used as a filler for naming purposes , the second being a ruse to intentionally disguise the production of a project . [ Wiki . ] ( https : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Working_title )

1 [ hover over for spoiler ] ( / c `` For me the twist in that movie was that she chose not to tell anyone . '' )

1 Bullshit . Federal statutes prevent the FBI from having a sense of humor .

1 That 's a bit how I saw it too , which is probably why it was barely talked about . No one in the movie really knew how it worked , just how to make it .

1 That was first movie I saw where people in the theater were saying like `` ohhhhhh '' and `` AW COME ON '' in the theater when it cut to black and I love it . It 's so awesome knowing others are investing in to the story and characters as much as I was .

1 `` Are you lying ? '' `` No . '' `` Are you a liar ? '' `` Yes . ''

1 agreed ... this movie just looked like a showcase for CGI and I didnt have any inclination to see it

1 I may be remembering incorrectly , but it would not have been odd for a Spartan to negatively refer to an Athenian as a boy lover . Sparta practiced homosexuality , but , if I remember correctly , there was a difference in how the two cultures went about it . In Sparta it would have been between to fully matured soldiers whereas in Athens it would have been between a man who attained citizenship and a younger man ( boy ) who wanted citizenship and was beong mentored by the older man . The Athenian style relationship usually ended when the boy became a man by Athenian standards whereas the Spartan style relationship would persist until ended by other means . Sparta and Athens being rivals , it would not have been odd for a Spartan to deride Athenian homosexuality . If I am wrong , someone please correct me .

1 Yes her character is a caricature , but she was also funny ( black humor instead of laugh-out-loud ) , the two are not mutually exclusive . You may not find her funny personally , but I just ca n't see how it 's debatable that many of her scenes are intentionally comedic .

1 Child abuse ? That is some puritan level hyperbole right there .

1 He ruined the original because of the on-screen epilogue and not leaving it with Willis walking out to Jackson laughing but noooooo . I should have known then .

1 I use a welding arc . Best of both worlds - magnetic and material damage .

1 I enjoyed them . If everyone tells me it sucks and there are better movies out then I might not watch it .

1 [ It may or may not be indicative of all the studios , but here 's one . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=bvYxaNVsTWQ )

1 why is it stupid ? i 've never had a cinematic experience quite like seeing interstellar on a 70mm imax ... the outer space shots , the worm hole shots , the shots of gargantua , the docking scene were all jaw-dropping ...

1 They are n't outdated ... Watch them

1 `` where you guys at ? I 'm at the fire ! ''

1 Boo to downvoters , that was n't part of the rules . `` If you do n't like it , leave it be . ''

1 Do n't forget the tense shift ! Grammar nazi awayyyyyyyyy ! ! !

1 Oh wow ! I had no idea ! / s

1 And stay away from the moon dust !

1 Man I do n't find that scene funny in the slightest bit , no offense . Interesting how different senses of humor can be though : D

1 The man knows ! The man knows !

1 That 's not entirely true . There are episodes of each series which are regarded as the best . For example , one of the episodes of TNG which has the highest rating would be `` The Inner Light '' .

1 I really hope all these upvotes realize he 's being sarcastic . Yikes .

1 It does look like they shot most of that fight in one long take , all the way into the fire hydrant . Setting it up again was probably a bitch . Who knows , maybe that was the best take of many . Any one of those punches could 've gone bad ( either injuring an actor or whiffing like the one that made it into the scene ) so it is n't like if they reshot it , they 'd only have to get _that_ punch right . Sonny biting Carlo 's hand is rather ... I do n't know if immature is the word ... I 'm not saying Sonny is the picture of maturity , I 'm saying that if you 're already brutally beating a man down in a crowded street , hitting him with your fists and a garbage can , I 'm not sure what kind of moves would be too child-like for you . Sonny is enraged , and he 's sort of an animal of a guy , so he just wants to punish Carlo in any way he can . I think the biting fits pretty well with the character and the scene .

1 I think it fits in the new universe . They are supposed to be more militarized after the encounter with Nero are they not ?

1 Or the joker remembers he has two arms and just pulls the pin with his other hand .

1 I do n't know about the 80 's but you ca n't say that about the 90 's . I was in college in the 90 's and worked in a science lab at a major uni . There were plenty of students ( especially graduate students ) from all races and nationalities .

1 Though the amount they got for it for featuring the Samsung logo probably made up for it .

1 I wish it was in US theaters .

1 Yes . What they were exploiting was the particular genre .

1 `` YOU CA N'T PUT LOVE ON THE FRONT PAGE ! GET OUT OF HERE , YOU 'RE FIRED ! ''

1 Or you could actually go see it as it was intended to be seen and at the same time help out a smaller movie . If you 're going to pirate anything , pirate it from Michael Bay for fuck 's sake . Assholes .

1 Still , it was a beautiful movie and you ca n't go wrong with Patton Oswalt .

1 I like this , Peter Parker as a scientist in his own right , and an equal to Bruce Banner and Tony Stark .

1 Yeah I agree . It is amazing seeing the `` behind the scenes '' of this stuff , especially if you only have basic knowledge of the programs used . If you are like me and enjoy seeing these things being made , I suggest watching the Videocopilot tutorials with Andrew Kramer . I have no interest in trying to make these things , but I watch his tutorials just because its fun to see how some of these things are made !

1 Yes , but not Gollum , that bastard deserved what was coming to him for bullying Smeagol .

1 Gold .

1 I am an atheist , so I laughed along with it , but it got old . No matter what the joke is , you ca n't have it sustain a whole movie .

1 Iron man yes . Incredible Hulk , no . I just watched it last night and it does not hold up after seeing Avengers hulk

1 > New show ? oh , if only !

1 That does n't move your ass a foot above your crotch though

1 The scene with the Vader mask scared the crap outta me ... hilarious though

1 Empire Records , maybe ?

1 28 weeks

1 Oh , I agree entirely . He was spot on . But if impersonation alone won Oscars then Robin Williams would have a trophy case full of 'em

1 Even so , my best decision before adulthood was responding to potty-training .

1 The . Fucking . Departed .

1 You are a fucking moron . A world renowned director is definitely going to have a different taste in movies than someone who watches movies in their free time . Grow the fuck up

1 It was nominated for Oscars . Not really underground .

1 twp spaces at the end of a line make a new line . Hit enter twice for a paragraph . A Knights Tale Braveheart Kingdom of Heaven The 13th Warrior Robin Hood ( the new Ridley Scott version ) King Arthur ( 2004 ) Valhalla Rising The Pillars of the Earth ( TV Show ) Black Death

1 yep

1 I saw that polar bear and I was like `` Superman is going to razz him up ! ''

1 My understanding is each country has its own mythology and therefore their own way to satisfy their Old Ones .

1 That 's the head of Starfleet Academy you 're talking about .

1 Yeah that was the most disappointing part for me . The effects were great , but I wanted to see every one of the battles and all of that development . Also , Bean 's character was fine if you 've never read the books , but he could 've been the highlight of the movie if they 'd adapted him faithfully .

1 Spot on with the first one . I 'm also glad that someone else enjoyed The One I Love .

1 Probably did n't help Terrence Howard that they were able to replace him with an unarguably better actor in Don Cheadle

1 Then I 'll save you some heartache : do n't . The director 's cut sacrifices the film 's soul in order to make Donnie out to be more of a superhero . I absolutely adore Donnie Darko , but I 've never hated a director 's cut more . The only part of it worth a damn is the commentary between Kevin Smith and the director . Smith rips it apart , it 's great .

1 Only if you are Elven and from the Tolkien universe .

1 Commas , uh , find a way .

1 Off the top of my head , I 'd say : Gattaca , District 9 , A Scanner Darkly , Man from Earth , Children of Men , Solaris , The Matrix , The Fountain , Akira , and Contagion .

1 > When does something stop being a spoiler and just become history ? When the receiver of said spoiler has seen the film .

1 TLDR the stormtroopers were highly skilled soldiers who were ordered to not hit the main posse , and there 's a lot of evidence supporting it .

1 I thought it was okay , but definitely one of the weaker ones .

1 Emotionally I 'd say it was in the green mile . It was unbearable for me to watch John Coffey 's final moments

1 I seriously doubt von Trier will be `` glorifying '' sex in any way . Nymphomaniac so far seems very similar to Steve McQueen 's Shame in that the basic plot focuses heavily on sex . But not solely in a `` look at how much sex these people have '' but `` look at what sex addiction can do to a person '' .

1 Ya . It goes from being unable to help but wanting to to just not helping ...

1 Feel the vibrations

1 This is exactly what I 'm here to ask . It was on about 9k points about 2 hours after posting and now it 's down at 5k . Very weird .

1 For all the talk you hear about what an absolute bitch Dolores Umbridge was in the 5th Harry Potter film , she does n't hold a candle the cunt avalanche that was Nurse Ratched .

1 Yeah , the Edith Paif portrait really got me .

1 I believe he said he will make it when he stops getting big contracts from hollywood , so maybe never .

1 `` Her buns were the best ! ''

1 Definitely

1 ... this made me laugh uncontrollably in the office right now : /

1 One should n't judge an actor by the number of awards he wins

1 Thanks , man . I 'm glad people even noticed my post , so thank you for the consideration .

1 I totally agree , and the Nolan fanbase is bothering me despite being a proud member . I gave * Interstellar * an A+ because it was * my * honest response , and giving it any other rating would have been dishonest to how much I liked the film . But that does n't mean everybody else has to . Or that I should be mad , angry , defensive , passive aggressive , or anxious when others dislike the movie .

1 The team-up between Sony and Marvel sort of pushed back a few release dates , including the Inhumans . The big tentpole Avengers films are still in the same spots , but Inhumans is slated to come out after Infinity War Part 2 right now .

1 No , I saw it at the TIFF Bell Lightbox Theatre in Toronto . The first time I saw it there were maybe 5 people in the theatre , which was a surreal experience .

1 I really love GotG but we are taking about a movie that was released on July 31st . GotG has gone from 94M -- > 42M -- > 25M and is projecting to be somewhere around the 20 million dollar range again this weekend . Sin City 1 had a 29 million dollar debut . With good marketing I think it had a reasonable chance of getting the # 1 slot but it definitely would n't have been a movie that had lasting appeal beyond the opening weekend . Far too many people commenting that they did n't even know it was out .

1 Confirmed : http : / imgur.com / 8pqtd0Q

1 Do you mean the sharp ? Or maybe the gate ?

1 Let me just say that Yojimbo is one of my all-time favorite movies , and is utterly brilliant from shot one to the final showdown . Seriously amazing stuff -- and the music gets stuck in my head for days . Also , interesting note about the film : Kurosawa based it on Dashiell Hammet 's novel Red Harvest , about a detective caught between two competing mobs in the thirties . The later film A Fistful of Dollars is based on Yojimbo , and then the Last Man Standing is a remake of all of them -- but is based on a couple of gangs and set in the early twentieth century . Three trips on the adaptation wheel and we 're back to the original story , sort of .

1 Statham 's movies basically do n't make money theatrically . Aside from Expendables ( which are n't `` his '' movies '' ) ... he never opens a movie to more than $ 10M . How is he the answer if you want to make lots of money ?

1 REC definitely . part 1 and 2 , part 3 is not as scary as part 1 and 2 .

1 Meanwhile , the latest Hunger Games is raking in the dough and Gone Girl becomes David Fincher 's highest-grossing film ...

1 You sir , just got my very first upvote with Grandma 's Boy . Jolly jesus balls , I love that movie

1 When I said anger issues I was referring to when he was talking to Bruce at the mansion and said he figured out he was batman because he had the same angry look he ( Blake ) did .

1 `` everyone who likes something I do n't is obviously faking it '' You know you actually just said that right

1 Amen bro . One of the most beautiful celebrations of the power of cinema . I love this single scene more than the rest of the film . Also see : CITY LIGHTS and NIGHTS OF CABIRIA . Make me tear up every time .

1 Mad Max * IS * a sequel ; it 's the fourth movie in a series .

1 Several girls I 've dated , when asking them out , have said it . Was n't intentionally braggy , it 's just one of the few times I 've heard people say it .

1 that made me hurt in more ways than one with t he behind the head walking around shit

1 Avengers has an aircraft carrier that is aircraft .

1 Really ? I could n't stop laughing every time he was on screen because all I saw was Andy Dwyer in funny pants . He even had the same character and stuff ( which he always does , it seems ) .

1 I am pretty sure he stipulates in his contract that there must be a scene of him running in every movie .

1 It is about a goddamn war man .

1 At least you get one more : )

1 made me laugh , upvote .

1 Get those mother-fucking lobbyists out my mother-fucking Oval Office !

1 I felt like it was pointless , but the two leads did give a great performance so I 'm not sour on it . It did n't really hurt anyone and I 'm really like seeing good child actors .

1 Absolutely . Over the past few weeks I 've started playing it as background music at home . My girlfriend really liked it , so I made her watch the movie .

1 If there are n't as many outside factors affecting it as Age of Ultron had , we could see this take the number 2 spot under Avengers for opening weekend . With little competition for the first 3 weeks of its run , it 'll likely gross at least enough to pass Iron Man 3 as the third highest Marvel Studios film .

1 And that 's when I realized the picture was sideways . Fuck me .

1 I thought Lloyd 's fantasy was the most hilarious .

1 I usually want to see the soundtrack , and that 's always right at the end .

1 Yeah it looks just like the one I own . It even has the safety sticker in the same place . Loving the attention to detail in the animation .

1 `` Wither into irrelevance '' is pretty harsh . It 's a historical film so it 'll still be revisted many times in the future , and it 's also still a great film . But I agree TSN will remain the superior film .

1 It says in the video annotations that it was a fan edit .

1 what ? ! his shit was sooo stupid . the entire joke is `` look how dumb this guy is . here 's how dumb he is on the phone , here 's how dumb he is when he falls in love , here 's what a female version of this dumb guy would look like ... '' it was awful

1 He was shooting `` Family Ties '' daytime and `` Back To The Future '' at night during this time . They put him in an ambulance when driving him between filming locations for some express sleep . I am not making this up .

1 Room 237 , as far as I can tell , was either a joke , or it was put together by a small team of subretarded , schizophrenic monkeys . It is the worst piece of rancid dogshit I have ever seen gather so many real-world and internet accolades . However much money was spent to make it should be awarded via class action suit on behalf of any viewer , to be awarded to the first jamoke to walk up an say he could make a better documentary with it . He could n't possibly be wrong . What made it worse was that the ( very minimalist ) trailer was intriguing .

1 You know , I kind of like these movies , but when I find myself walking in the country after dark , I inevitably look up towards the sky and get a chill down my spine as I imagine a silhouette moving by

1 I thought it could be a little shorter due to what I thought was more of a portrait movie than a plot-driven movie but I liked it . My other complaint : I wished Silvana was a bit less of a stereotype but at least they gave her some screen time and a personal life . Pluses : Jennifer Anniston was great and it had a good sense of place ( poor Riverside , chock full of people out to get you ) .

1 The gorgeous , young crew as old , ugly people ? ! That would n't appeal to young people ! Write a story where they save earth at the last possible minute , we need to appeal to a broad audience , everyone knows earth .

1 -_- Yes but some more than others .

1 > It 's considered short for an anime ( around 144 episodes ) What ? The vast majority of anime are about 12 episodes long .

1 I 'm going to go out on a .. limb here and take this as 'written line ' for action or speak . I think his best line is : * after killing all guards by stabbing a heap and whacking them around * .. * groot turns to the others / camera and puts on this big 'I did good , yes ? ! ' smile *

1 Talking monkey , yeah , yeah . Came here from the future , ugly sucker , only says `` ficus '' .

1 Holy crap , Ron Howard is directing ! ? Now I * really * want to see this !

1 did n't it seem just like it was meant to be a vehicle for good acting instead of a good movie ?

1 Yep . Dat raw energy as a villain . Every word is like a kick in the junk in the best way .

1 Sorry , I should have been clearer , in the long term , sure he 'll be remembered for his writing , and the homophobic stuff will probably be a footnote , but in the current day , that 's practically all you hear about the guy . I just remember him having some very thought provoking views on ( at the time ) current events and some interesting strategies on how to handle them and it 's possible he could have ended up being a important political personality had he decided not to share his particular viewpoint on homosexual marriage . Or I suppose better yet if he had n't had that viewpoint in the first place .

1 Of course we have ! Look at this huge list of [ swedish serial killers ! ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Category : Swedish_serial_killers ) I have no idea how many there have been here though . Also , I made a [ short list of some r-rated films and their rating in sweden . ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / bwtby / stupidest_thing_ive_heard_all_day_watching_rrated / c0oydgx )

1 Danced ; flamer .

1 I was excited when I saw the Phantom Menace trailer too , so naturally I will reserve judgement on this one . I am optimistic though !

1 Nah man , it ai n't white boy day

1 Do n't know if that 's intentional or not , but it 's hilarious .

1 [ Hearts of Darkness ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0102015 / ) - some say it 's better than Apocalypse Now itself . It 's not , but it 's still really fucking great .

1 I think it 's because X Men : Last Stand is a terrible movie that does n't sense .

1 its not your fags kids but theaters , longer movies=less number of shows per day

1 I 'm pretty sure both of those would receive an `` R '' rating

1 This is n't Let Me In which gave a rather mediocre director the right to remake a stone-cold classic film . This is Fincher ; one of the best film-makers around atm , working with an unreal cast , written by an insane scribe . This is going to be ballin ' .

1 You 've got to be fucking kidding . Theoretical Physicists , just walk away , it 's only a publicity shill trying to earn their stipend .

1 Eh that seems more like a moment of shock or despair . They did the unworthy bit in the first Avengers , I do n't think they 'll repeat it

1 I think thats what most of us were hoping for . instead ... .

1 Good contribution .

1 Generational . He would be a normal boy until puberty then wolf .

1 It would work if they cared more about independent and foreign films . But they do n't , so it does n't work as well .

1 Which is why he kept trying to turn the job down , until God got angry and sent Aaron to talk for him .

1 brave comment on Reddit : )

1 It 's a lot like politics . Crazy wealthy people with a lot of ties get together , they decide on things , and sometimes people who work for them or with them are too afraid of what would happen to their career to point out that something they 're doing is crazy or stupid . We had a big issue like this in the 70 's and early 80 's with the New Hollywood movement , except there it was largely just a director issue . Hip new directors were given too much power after early successes and ended up responsible for -huge- financial bombs like Sorcerer , Heaven 's Gate , etc . Now , we 're -basically- going through the same thing , but the issue is coming more from studios . You see , studios have been under a lot of pressure lately due to waning sales , strikes from various unions ( like the writer 's guild strike that crippled the industry for a bit ) , and their reaction to all of this has largely been to just play it as safe as possible . Remakes , sequels , etc . How 'd this end up becoming the issue we have now ? They saw the huge success they were having with these remakes and sequels and decided `` Wow , hey . This film made 3x its budget back . Now , if we put in a budget of $ 250mil ... '' Basically , the studios are like a desperate , dim witted man in a Las Vegas casino , and they 're running out of luck because so many franchises have been tapped dry . That 's why we 're starting to see remakes of obscure as fuck things , but with huge budgets . I mean if you think the upcoming Toxic Avenger remake from the creator of Hot Tub Time Machine is odd , The Town That Deaded Sundown , a 1976 horror film with a fanbase that could comfortably be fit inside of a CVS , is getting remade . Or , god , look at the Paul Verhoeven remakes . Total Recall got remade . Robocop has a PG-13 remake coming out . Starship Troopers has a remake in the works . I 'm gon na wake up tommorow and find a Showgirls remake has been announced . tl ; dr : Studios are bad at planning , bad with money , do n't want to try anything original , and are running low on non-original things they can exploit .

1 My guess is that we are seeing bits and pieces of the first 10 minutes At least that 's what I hope

1 It was mentioned

1 I know what you 're talking about ! You 're thinking of the original [ teaser ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ihkx5Qq8AUU ) for the film , which contained none of the footage from the final film . Pixar does this with just about all their teasers , most notably Monsters , Inc . and The Incredibles .

1 I totally here where yo are coming from ... Frodo had the biggest burden of all the members of the fellowship . I just really hated Elijah Wood as Frodo . I read the books before seeing the movies and had a much different image of him in my mind .

1 Oh man there are so many reasons why . First , Luke had not yet given himself to the dark side , so had he killed the Emperor , it would have left Darth Vader in charge and he was not a leader . He followed the Emperor without question and without the Emperor around Vader would have been directionless . Another is that Luke killed the Emperor , it would have almost certainly kept him from joining the dark side . Vader not allowing Luke to kill the Emperor only made Luke more angry inside and grow closer to the dark side . Basically neither Vader or the Emperor wanted Luke to join the dark side by force . They wanted to draw him over and make it be his decision .

1 Not really .

1 I found it oddly entertaining . Perhaps because I 've never gone to a movie with lower expectations .

1 I say it does . That was a table of some talented actors . You ever kill a horse ?

1 Enterprise is set many years before Kirk 's time . Without spoiling things , Weller 's character could n't be the same guy . However it would n't be the first time Star Trek has re-used actors in different roles . Although admittedly they often do it under Alien makeup , so it is n't as apparent .

1 How can you say they 're boring films if you have n't even finished the first movie ?

1 Only a fascist would n't .

1 I do n't see how this analogy makes sense..

1 I kind of wish the movie ended like it did in real life . Marcus broke his back he took a stick and would draw a line and crawl too it . He did it for days until the villager found him . The villager picks him up and takes care of him . There was no gun fight in the village in real life . I do n't know why they felt the need to tack that extra scene on . I guess it was just for another action set-piece .

1 If your brother does n't want to watch fight club then introduce him to your best guy friend because he wants / needs to meet him .

1 Yeah . i like how his Adult Self Narrator uses bigger words and attaches such grandeur to his own life , with a subtly implied self-mocking tone . The stuff he says , while not literally true , probably felt every bit as important as the narrator makes it sound when he was a kid .

1 Bernie was awesome .

1 So that makes at least two of us who live in that `` town where nobody lives . ''

1 If it was below the middle line , it 'd be in the shitty section .

1 And Star Wars made a conscious effort to emulate serials and archetypes from that era . That was the whole point . Everyone had forgotten about that stuff by the 70s .

1 Nah , the `` Now , like a supermodels vagina , let 's welcome Leonardo DiCaprio '' was better .

1 They play on repeat somewhere in the sixth circle of Hell . Nah but for real they 're pretty fucking bad .

1 He 's got Adaptation , Blade Runner , Dr. Strangelove , Fargo , Grave of the Fireflies , Magnolia , My Neighbor Totoro , Pan 's Labyrinth , Pulp Fiction and Raiders of the Lost Ark . So , not 12 Monkey , Fight Club or Primer , but quite a few movies that Reddit likes . I 've seen half the list and really enjoyed about 9 out of every 10 that I 've seen . It 's one of the better `` best '' movie lists that I 've started working my way through .

1 You simultaneously ruined Charlie and the Chocolate Factory * and * Back to the Future for me .

1 I loved this . I saw it twice . It really does n't have any boring parts , and the stories are all good enough they could be made their own movies , especially the 2012 and 2014 ones . There was actually alot of posts about it on here but it was completely overlooked outside America due to the stupid fucking three month wait they gave us for no reason . Nobody in Australia knew WTF I was talking about and nobody saw it so cinemas dumped it pretty quick .

1 > LUKE : Obi-Wan Kenobi ?

1 Or as long as we 're talking about Red Hot Chili Peppers members in movies , Anthony Keidis in Point Break .

1 You are absolutely right . Chinese films are not even close in this game . And it 's getting worse with the government putting up barriers to protect them . If you pull the right strings and make sure half of the screens in theaters are playing your film and NO Hollywood films are on , there 's gon na be money no matter how bad your film is . People will be talking about it and they will get curious . When they wan na see a movie it 's the only choice they have . Under less extreme circumstances , there 's usually 2-3 foreign films in theaters , versus 5-10 domestic ones , so it 's not uncommon that people would just try to see every howllywood movie that 's available . Considering the harsh governmental restriction in importing films ( only 34 permitted per year ) , audience would automatically assume that they have to be good enough to get in .

1 Damn news networks telling us the story years before the movie came out !

1 Knowing there 's a twist is a goddamn spoiler .

1 I liked it .

1 It 's the type of build and the way it was built . 100k includes filter and the `` river simulation '' .

1 It transcends culture and I believe that it will become a classic . The movie might become a cultural artifact if we manage to find a proper cure for alcoholism but I do n't see that happening any time soon . : )

1 If the Ministry knew when they were time traveling , they would 've had some * serious * problems with the events at the end of the third book .

1 Well if you want discussion , then ask for discussion . If you want to martyr yourself on the pyre of the `` hivemind '' , then say so . For me , I 'm excited to see this movie because I count Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz as two of my favourite movies . Knowing that this is the third in the conceptual trilogy makes me happy , because I liked the other two . I feel like most people in this `` circlejerk '' that you 're complaining about feel the same , or they 're Simon Pegg / Nick Frost / Martin Freeman fans , and are looking forward to a comedy featuring all three of them .

1 Though I 'm willing to bet that part of the story was cooked up * because * he is such a loved character from the OT .

1 Gus Van Sant directed Milk and Finding Forrester . Neither were bigger than Good Will Hunting but did well commercially . And the most of the Farrelly 's movies were commercially successful .

1 AKA why do people still treat him like an unknown actor .

1 Usual Suspects was n't a Tarantino movie . Were you thinking of Reservoir Dogs ? Anyway , I think his films are a lot more enjoyable if you ignore the man himself .

1 The speech with the dicks and assholes at the end of Team America

1 I did n't love it . It was n't a bad film necessarily it just was not for me . My cousin wanted to see it . I knew it was n't Twilight and thought the story may be something I can get with but I was a bit bored by it .

1 I have to agree with this . Slaver / Treason / Confederate apologia makes me incredibly angry ( just see my posts in /r/badhistory ) . The only way I can watch this movie any more is drunk , which is a shame because it is an otherwise very well done film ; the acting , costumes , music , color , etc . are all superb ( plus I 'm a big fan of both Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable fan ) . It just * butchers * historical analysis .

1 He made a bit of a cameo , if you think about it .

1 That was a shit review and did n't even trash it .

1 What about `` The Hunger '' from 1983 ? Catherine Deneuve bangs Susan Sarandon , infects her with vampirism . ( Homo ) sexuality + bodily fluids = death . The 80s in a nutshell . Sometimes possibly but not always necessarily homophobic , since it was in everybody 's heads anyway .

1 Having read this and the full article , I ca n't help but think he 's taking the piss with his apology . It proves exactly what he was saying and he apologies with an over the top apology . Sadly the ADL were too quick to be outraged over it than to see the irony in it .

1 Yes ! He was dead cadet 's dad in The First duty . Watched that one recently . Even in a small role like this Ed Lauter could shine . He will be missed on screen , and from the kind words said in this topic , off screen as well .

1 [ duhleeted ]

1 IIRC , that shot was n't actual footage from the movie . It was test footage filmed a few years ago . Paul Rudd had n't even been cast yet , and Edgar Wright was still attached to the project .

1 It did n't for me and it did n't for you apparently . But if you want Nancy Housewife with 2 years of high school to recommend the movie to her friends she needs to know what the fuck is going on . It 's just how it is , otherwise Nolan would n't be able to recoup the 165 million dollars he spent on the movie and no one would let him make movies . So as a necessary evil I do n't mind it at all . It really was n't that horribly painful , otherwise I would 've .

1 I can understand not liking his films , but to say he makes the same movie year after year is just plain wrong . He does hit similar themes often ( Broadway , film , show business , relationships between men and women , love , sex , New York , intellectualism , Judaism and religion ) , but certainly not always and not in the same way . Take , for example Sleeper , Broadway Danny Rose , Zelig , Bananas , Crimes and Misdemeanors , and Vicky Christina Barcelona , you 'd have to not have seen any of them to think they were the same .

1 Considering that movie takes alt of stylistic and artistic chances , and yet is remembered as one of the greatest parodies ever , I 'd say it is about art . Especially for him .

When people say * The Professional * , they usually * are * referring to the international version ( * L ? on * ) . But since it was released as * The Professional * first in America , most Americans know it as * The Professional * , not * L ? on * , so even when they refer to the extended version , they tend to call it * The Professional * . Try not to be such a huge festering cock when expressing your opinions next time and you wo n't get downvoted .

1 that 's an excellent point . I was thinking about this later too , and I think it might have been added to actually show Bruce happy . Something we have really never seen since he was a child in the garden .

1 Yes ... but in my mind it does n't mean we should stop short of advancing movie technology . It means we should work harder on make-up , props , and sets . I 'm hoping that most people will eventually see the 48fps switch ( which unlike 3D will happen ) as a great advancement in cinema .

1 Very true , but watch it the second time around and you feel impossibly stupid for missing all those obvious signs !

1 I got ta thoroughly disagree with this statement . I would n't go as far to say it 's underrated by any means but I do think it 's underappreciated , even by those who love it . I think a lot of people see the film as just a stupid , zany stoner comedy . But it really is much more . The film is a wonderful examination of a man who lives in a world that is fast changing while he tries to hold on to his obsolete lifestyle . It also examines this through the context of PTSD in the character of Walter . I think the film is a brilliant statement about America in the 90s and it really stops and reflects on what happened to the last remnants of the vietnam era .

1 In regards to technical achievements , it was the first film to use deep focus which allowed everything in the shot to be seen in focus , not just the foreground . Secondly , the narrative structure had pretty much never been seen before in Classical Hollywood . Thirdly , in mine and quite a lot of other peoples minds , it is an excellent film .

1 Also , with all the things that happened to him , with the assaults and rapes , and being enslaved to use his skills to commit financial crimes , you would think that it would have broken a normal man who was guilty . It was Andy 's hope and knowledge of being innocent that kept him going for so long .

1 La Haine .

1 Have you see the `` set '' that they put the actors in ? They basically trapped them in a box alone and had a camera hover around them for hours . It was n't talking to 10 imaginary actors , it was pretending to be totally alone while actually being totally alone .

1 No , it was just a joke . But what does that have to do with anything ? Why does this have to be sarcastic ? Its very consistant in tone with the book , and it was reasonably well-received . No , he did n't write the screenplay . I think that if he did n't like it , he just would have said so . His comment is n't even somewhat sarcastic .

1 uhhhhh I would n't categorize Airplane ! as guilty pleasure . It 's consistently voted one of the top ( if not THE top ) comedy movies of all time .

1 so clever .

1 I agree with you ! I cried afterwards anyway , such a heartwarming movie .

1 Close enough . Morricone did quite a Carpenter-ish soundtrack for The Thing .

1 Who does n't ?

1 darjeeling limited . come on man , at least know the title of the movie you are criticizing : /

1 It 's not a remake , it 's a sequel .

1 [ A Soldier 's Sweetheart ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0129414 / ) The plot of the movie was adapted from a chapter in Tim O'Brien 's `` The Things They Carried '' . They went far and above from what the one chapter said about the situation . And there 's not a book titled `` A Soldier 's Sweetheart '' nor `` Sweetheart of Song Tra Bong '' ( the chapter title ) . So , although not fully meeting your criteria per se , it works .

1 He 's also had plenty of `` acting like a dickhead just about anywhere to just about anyone '' moments . I think it 's safe to say the guy is just a self-centered asshole at this point .

1 Why ? What makes McConaughey the best choice , other than his being an actor whose work you enjoy ? What uniquely Zappa-esque qualities has he displayed to lead you to this conclusion ? If you want to generate a discussion , you have to lead the way .

1 I liked Tusk , too . Kevin Smith has always been great at writing monologues , and this movie was full of them . I thought Depp 's role was a great return to character acting for him , after leading so many big-budget stinkers .

1 His chemistry with Murray in Stripes is pitch perfect , you can really tell that they were friends with a rich history

1 I think his point about swearing is that it has become a crutch . Dialogue is so filled with it that it is replacing the substance and variety that older movies had . He even said that he is not opposed to swearing when it has value . The use of 'nigger ' in * Blazing Saddles * was very important to the plot and theme . It was not just interjected without reason .

1 Think we 're getting it in January . A slightly belated birthday present from Mr Tarantino .

1 The first movie introduces a concept and follows it through to its logical conclusion . It 's a story with a beginning , middle and end . Your proposed story saves the film 's turning point for a Shyamalan-esque `` what a twist ! '' ending that 's ultimately pointless .

1 He was holding wine .

1 Oh . Herp derp . Thanks for explaining that : p

1 You are right , you are n't .

1 DAMMIT , I WAS TOLD THERE WOULD BE NO SPOILERS .

1 The Outlaw Josey Wales .

1 They 'll probably be used for plates , napkins , cups , etc . Type of stuff you see at a Party City .

1 Just print the damn thing already !

1 I 'd answer this but , unfortunately , I 'm outta time .

1 Howard Hawks movies in general have great , rapid-fire witticisms . * The Big Sleep * and * To Have and Have Not * are also good examples .

1 That 's because for the first time in a long time ( ever ? ) he was playing a true villain , and absolutely killed it

1 Ironic shitposting is functionally indistinguishable from actual shitposting

1 Haha I did the same thing pretty much . The moment right after the long parking garage fight with the old gypsy woman . When she took the button and starting cursing her , I said * that 's all she wanted ? * and yeah everyone laughed it was awesome .

1 Yeah , star whackers .

1 The Rundown is a fucking ripper of an action comedy . Doom was pretty average . But then again The Rock 's performance as Sarge was the best part of it . He even got the iconic line , `` big fucking gun '' . Hercules was dog shit but that 's what happens when you get Brett Ratner to direct .

1 i appreciate the effort made for this comment .

1 SO posing nude is considered a big unethical controversy in Bollywood , huh ? That 's adorable . I wonder if all kinds of feathers get ruffled too when an actor says a naughty word .

1 Everyone form up * unzips *

1 Cable and Deadpool is a great series . The latest Hawkeye is a good read .

1 Not entirely . Bits are , bits are not . And physics is singular , not plural . There is no such thing as the study of many `` physic '' s . Oh , and lose the apostrophe on `` it 's '' .

1 Seconded , that 's a fucking great film . The prequel is n't too bad either , though the serious lack of Kurt Russell 's badassery hurts it .

1 Tuck and roll !

1 his american is iffy , but when he 's doing well-spoken english or irish he sounds perfect . Inglorious Basterds and Prometheus had me swooning

1 I would bet that most of the people complaining are fresh out of ( or currently in ) high school.. : /

1 Emma Stone in EVERY movie . Even movies that she is n't in , I 'm just thinking `` I fucking love Emma Stone . ''

1 * especially * if it was Zimmerman 's address .

1 I just like Chris Sabat as Vegeta . I think it just works a bit better .

1 I wait until it is playing in my area . If the movie does well in the 4 test cities it will get to me eventually . What I do n't do is rely on the argumentum ad Piratum , the mistaken belief that one 's personal inconvenience makes it okay to illegally download it .

1 Do n't worry , one day you will be a big boy and get to go see the big boy movies . Go see Mirror Mirror instead .

1 Michael did n't want to be part of the Corleone crime family . He wanted to complete college and become a math professor . He was thrust into the role because he had to protect his family . When Michael enlists in the army it is an act of rebellion against his father . Michael is perturbed when Tom Hagen mentions that the Don and himself have discussed Michael 's future because Michael views his future as belonging to him . He was not a dutiful Italian son who would do whatever his father asked .

1 I 've seen and enjoyed The Lookout and 500 Days of Summer , but the Brick / Mysterious Skin epiphany was a one-two punch that occurred over the course of 24 hours . I do think it 's interesting that two of those films ( The Lookout and Mysterious Skin ) are built on memory issues .

1 [ This ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / cwitu / this_is_the_funniest_trailer_ive_seenthis_is_us / c0vt4ni ) comment thread sums up what the OP probably meant . Shaun of the Dead : Zombie films : : This movie : Slasher films Shaun of the Dead : UK : : This movie : US

1 The RIAA and the DEA used the same math textbook in acronym school .

1 It basically was going to be the film that * Rio * is .

1 See , I do n't get that . I guess i just remember watching my Aladdin VHS tape as a kid and seeing The Lion King preview , which shows them BRINGING A FUCKING LION into the drawing studio so the animators could work with a real life model .

1 Guy living in Asia here , that fat kid needs to lighten up . I think that they 'll be fine though matt stone and trey Parker survived team America and I 'm pretty sure the pissed off everyone who has a corncob up their ass from the muslim extremists to the North Korean `` great leader ''

1 Or you could masterbate

1 Read the post .

1 I would n't mind someone remaking the Hobbit in a few decades . It should be one long movie that closely follows the book instead of PJ 's trilogy version ( which I thought was a bit of a let-down vs LOTR ) .

1 You need to see this movie . You may only watch it once then , avoid it for the rest of your life , but it is truly a magnificent film . Consider the effect it has - almost universally people will tell you that you have to see it , and that they saw it , but do n't want to watch it again . That should tell you how perfectly Aronofsky captured some piece of us , and how ... fuck , words fail me . Just watch it .

1 I tend to think of Christian Bale as someone who is good , but often gets the scene stolen from him . Dark Knight and Public Enemies come to mind . The Fighter definitely gave him a chance to turn the tables , I will admit that .

1 Ohmygosh I love him . This is going to be great .

1 Gatsby was a poor kid pretending to be rich . Of course there was cheesy effects . Everything particularly planned for Daisy .

1 Guys , do n't downvote just because he looks stupid

1 Such a great obscure movie and possibly one of his best roles .

1 and authentic .

1 For IMAX . Life of Pi does this too in the flying fish scene .

1 Grave of the Fireflies is relentlessly depressing . Beautiful , but completely void of hope . Good recommendation .

1 As far as I can recall , [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` the main character gets stabbed when he stands up for another kid at school , and he bleeds out on the ground . Totally depressing . '' )

1 That dangerously close to making sense , you might want to cut that shit out it could get you killed .

1 `` When they took him up in the spaceship , the aliens abused him ... sexually . ''

1 The original bear that inspired the books was , yeah . The books / movie and the author were British .

1 they need SOMETHING to overblow to print in tabloids along side a sad and photoshopped-to-make-it-really-ugly picture of Gervais on the cover along side tag lines like `` DID HE GO TOO FAR ? ! ? ''

1 This guy HAD to have been in my theater when I just saw The Avengers . Not even kidding , he yelled JESUS MARY AND JOSEPH during the final fight scene . He was also alone , and snuck in . Ugh .

1 One of those or batman mask of the phantasm

1 Nice .

1 Whiskey Tango ? The one that could fly is the one the baby came from . Hannibal Chau says `` this is where the Kaiju fell , this is where we concentrate our efforts ''

1 Yeah , it 's like a cow 's opinion . It just does n't matter . It 's moo

1 Small moments which demonstrate it to the viewer without resorting to just telling them explicitly : Bruce Willis calmly tricking a mugger in Fifth Element Antionio Banderas teaching himself Viking in the 13th Warrior ( I like this one because it informs not only the viewer but the other characters as well , in an elegant way ) .

1 Cant go wrong with blazing saddles !

1 ... in SPACE .

1 Just saw it . I think it had a lull , personally .

1 Here 's the thing : branding is a big deal for all companies . That 's why you see [ product placement ] ( http : / youtu.be / tRmRMnVULs8 ? t=4m35s ) ( note : satire ) in movies , millions spent on SuperBowl ads and more . People buy shit based off what they see their `` heros '' using . To claim that product placement has no effect is like saying advertising has no effect - people want the same shit seen in movies and on TV , like the Oakleys in X-men , or the rifle in CoD . And it 's because the characters are acting out fantasies using these products , it 's pretty fucking hypocritical to turn around and criticize the same shit you used to engage in a masturbatory power fantasy and reaped millions from it .

1 I was about to say ... the spiderman one looks pretty obvious haha

1 Second for the Shank

1 Its how you show upgrades and changes to characters .

1 All throughout the series , especially after the first few trade 's worth , the tone of the remaining population shifted away from `` fix it '' to `` move on . '' That is , instead of trying to remake Earth-That-Was , they realized the absolute absurdity of such a task and worked towards something new . The advent of cloning , and later actual walking males to allow for a long-lasting society , was n't about going back but just making sure the human race would stay alive . The new Yoricks were n't born so that they could repopulate the male demographic and send the world back to what it is , but so that the species could move on and keep living .

1 yeah but people assumed it would . thats why they didnt see it

1 until season 2 ; which they might has well have just called the show The Blue Beetle .

1 Obligatory Simpsons quote : `` Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies ? For fun ? Well , I did n't hear anybody laughing ! Did you ? ! ''

1 He does that with all his roles it seems . Plus he was too much Batman in Salvation . So much grunting and whispering .

1 ... and he had a fucking perfect year already !

1 You 're just upset that * DeliciousMoldyBread II : The Crust * is in development hell .

1 Wow I thought they 'd picked him up fresh off HIMYM but I just looked up the years and it might have been the other way around .

1 The cellar-bar scene from beginning to end is only one of the many reasons i rewatch that film once every couple months ! I love it !

1 It 's supposed to be more rapey . Edit : http : / www.complex.com / pop-culture / 2012 / 06 / 10-things-you-didnt-know-about-ridley-scott-alien / adult-alien

1 Yeah I think people were expecting loads of answers and it to be neatly packaged . But if you think about it , Alien never answered all its own questions . It was n't until Aliens , etc we learned more .

1 bargain bin

1 Hands down .

1 Exactly ! It was so subtle but so effective . Out of all studio logo bumps , I always ranked the Marvel one the highest because it was like a seal of quality . With this new one ... ehh , was an unneeded update , although I suppose they want to separate themselves from the other marvel properties being produced by other studios .

1 There are plenty of good pg13 action movies .

1 Apparently .

1 You got the order backwards

1 Monsters is pretty great . While there are fewer scenes involving said monsters than one might imagine , they 're utilised pretty effectively for the movie to work- plus , the general atmosphere and setting is pretty compelling in itself .

1 Adam Sandler in Brooklyn Nine Nine was a surprise as well

1 And without the movie it would n't have existed..

1 Could be Art School ? I majored in graphic design and I took a screenwriting class and a history of film class . First place I saw Wong Kar Wai 's In the Mood for Love and was really introduced to foreign cinema . In screenwriting we were encouraged to bring in a movie and vote on what to watch . We watched a movie every class til the last few weeks when we were writing our own screenplays .

1 The plane made from recycled paper .

1 Strange choice in music .

1 I think they mean Marvel Studios movies . As the other villains are at different studios and Marvel has no control how they are handled .

1 Zooey Deschanel is awkward , not crazy

1 The Prestige and Inception where amazing .

1 I doubt it .

1 It 's incredible . Watch it .

1 You mean the famous storyline ripped straight from the comics ?

1 I never catch continuity errors but the scene when the limo pulls up to Jordan 's condo is a mess . In one shot the limo is there . The next it 's gone . Then it 's pulling away , then it 's stationary . Then it pulls away again , hot mess !

1 God I love that scene . Just putting it out there .

1 [ scared ya ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ip1XtsAdn2o )

1 * something something something * damnit * something something * you beat me to it

1 Well the cat probably was n't a suitable host for the Alien , the dog was larger and the facehuggers are n't as picky . I 'm betting a full grown alien would n't care too much about the dog either .

1 This picture makes him look like The Rock size . He 's definitely not that big .

1 Hmmm ... you used the 1998 Roland Emmerich Godzilla as Judas ? You are a hero !

1 Because redditors are confused about the pros and cons to using steroids . Apparently most redditors think if you use steroids you 'll destroy your body and get cancer and die .

1 Ya , if we get into this in for music , I think there are a bunch of stories . Like Pete Best being dropped from the Beatles before they blew up .

1 If we want to talk cinematography citizen kane is one legitimate example .

1 `That 's like 10 % of all immature Superman jokes at best.`

1 Roger Ebert 's commentary on Citizen Kane .

1 `` Citizen Kane 's commentary on the pursuit of wealth , happiness , the human condition , and memory offer nothing to the modern moviegoing audience ! ''

1 Turn back now , nothing unusual to see here . Semi-smiling people clapping .

1 I personally do n't want to see a Nolan directed Bond . I dont think his style of action is fast paced and exciting enough to work in the 007 universe . That 's just one man 's opinion , however .

1 That 's a fair point , not a flop ( especially in this day in age ) , but not what a bankable movie star would have gotten you even ten-fifteen years ago . It 's different now .

1 In Jim Carrey 's costuming

1 Yeah but that symbolism of her floating in the fetal position with tube in the background like an umbilical chord was about as subtle as a brick to the face .

1 Good LORD ! . . . I 'm moved to answer that , but it 's impossible . You ca n't say `` I wan na see the whole * world * . . where should go first ? '' Best perhaps to get an idea of what mood you 're in & read thru the filmography on Wikipedia . For every different shade in the spectrum , there 'd be a film to suit it : giddily goofy - `` The Adventures of Baron Munchausen '' , `` The Aristocrats '' , `` Death to Smoochy '' emotionally deep -- `` What Dreams May Come '' , `` The Fisher King '' average flick with extra poignancy - `` Flubber '' , `` Cadillac Man '' , `` Moscow On The Hudson '' adapted bio-pic - `` Awakenings '' , `` Dead Poets Society '' , `` Good Morning , Vietnam '' voice-work -- `` Ferngully '' , `` Robots '' , `` Happy Feet '' 1 & 2 , `` A.I . Artificial Intelligence '' outright `` fantasy '' - `` Hook '' , `` Bicentennial Man '' , `` Jumanji '' where do I * end * ? ! ?

1 I ca n't even tell if that 's an Entourage joke .

1 I did n't cry , but I really enjoyed it .

1 [ Here is the part . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=gUYDj2Ge28o & feature=related )

1 I felt the same way and I love Birbiglebug . Oh well .

1 As a spectacle , I think it 's very much up there . As a film with acting and plot and stuff , not so much . The kid in me thought it was sublime .

1 Not at all . They 're vigilantes killing evil men . Whether or not you agree with vigilanteism , who 's good and who 's bad is still clear ( in the context of the movie ) .

1 `` England ? I do n't believe it ! '' `` What , a massive conspiracy of cartographers ? ''

1 This , except we watch it in July , it really pisses off the wife .

1 > We did one recently of American Pie , but we reversed the gender roles . All the women played men ; all the men played women . And it was so fascinating to be a part of this because , as the women took on these central roles ? they had all the good lines , they had all the good laughs , all the great moments ? the men who joined us to sit on stage started squirming rather uncomfortably and got really bored because they were n't used to being the supporting cast . > It was fascinating to feel their discomfort [ and ] to discuss it with them afterward , when they said , * `` It 's boring to play the girl role ! '' And I said , `` Yeah . Yeah . You think ? Welcome to our world ! '' *

1 Saved . Thanks for this .

1 `` Here this helps '' is what Harry says to Lloyd right before this gif .

1 I think the first one was fantastic , then TDK was great , although it had some pacing problems . TDK is redeemed thanks to Heath Ledger 's performance . The Dark Knight Rises though ? That movie just gets more boring and terrible with each viewing . And the dialogue ... it 's so bad .

1 Michele was just ditzy . Phoebe was an eccentric hippy .

1 The greater good ...

1 I 'll tell you why : Nerds are the most annoying people to please . There 's usually very little gray area with them- it 's either super awesome or the biggest piece of shit ever , and the line between the two can be the dumbest , most trivial thing you can imagine . Did n't like one scene / one character / * too * loyal to the comics / because of speed ramping / because of the other movies Snyder made / because Alan Moore 's thoughts on it / the Mastercard Guy 's voice / because cynicism rules . edit : [ another convo about this topic ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / xly8i / i_just_finished_watching_watchmen_for_the_3rd / ) edit 2 : [ 2 year old convo about this topic ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / csy0h / every_time_i_read_message_boards_about_zack / )

1 Its an ok comedy , I think a lot of people candy coat some of their childhood films with nostalgia a bit .

1 Jup this is exactly what I saw back in the trailer so far aswell , and this problems appears more often with sequels not solely in movies but aswell in games .

1 I had to check wikipedia to make sure who the voice actor was . I was right that it was Steve Blum , and while I love the man 's work , he is just not right for Darkseid . Not at all .

1 Trying hard to do / be what , exactly ? All I see in that movie is a guy trying like hell to stay as faithful as fuck to the source material .

1 He did n't really look Indian either , but I think he did a hell of a job playing Gandhi .

1 The Netherlands , but do n't hold it against me .

1 Best scene in cinema , period .

1 Zetus Lapetus , I ca n't believe you 'd say that .

1 You arr useress to me , rctsorrid !

1 That one did it for me . It had a real good Bond feel , probably my favorite out the the 4 he did cause it was n't too `` over the top ''

1 the habitat was for weyland i assuume , philqw is right in that he was surprised that his daughter went on the trip and didnt expect her there . thats why she was not mentioned in weylands hologram presentation and saying she was in charge instead of the 2 dr 's . also , weyland didnt spend time in that habitat in that he was in stasis up until it was directly time to go meet the space jockeys / architects . he was literally on the verge of dying and was trying to buy as much time as he could but it seemed as if that habitat was certainly for him which is why the med pod was configured for a man .

1 Too late .

1 If only * Law Abiding Citizen * did n't have such a shit ending . Why could n't he have just succeeded in his well thought out , ten-years-in-the-making grand scheme ?

1 No , Cruise responded . It includes the message he 's responding to . If you look at he top of the page you 'll see Alexander says LMAO # 5 or whatever

1 I 'm telling you how I felt about the novel personally . I do get the symbolisms in the novel and stuff , but I 'm not a phony . I wo n't agree with everyone just because they found it great . I 'm wondering if there are people out there like me .

1 Gut reaction I agree , but looking over his filmography ... if we are talking about types of roles ( and not necessarily how well he did in those roles ) then the first half of his career had quite a lot of types of roles . Air Heads , Big Daddy , Bulletproof , Punch Drunk Love , Spanglish , The Longest Yard , You Do n't Mess With The Zohan . Some of those are stupid roles and some of them are interesting , but they are all fairly different from the typical `` Sander does physical humor in a somewhat romcom thing '' that we have had many times over the last 10 years .

1 I wish I could pay money for a separate DVD of just watching a Director direct the entire movie from start to finish . What an invaluable asset that would be to an aspiring filmmaker .

1 [ Link ] ( http : / online.wsj.com / article / SB10001424052748703766704576009343432436296.html ) to Ebert 's actual article instead of this blogspam shit .

1 It has the * same midget . * I looked this up after watching the movie and I was horrified .

1 Apparently his character in NBK was n't supposed to be Australian , but he had just been to Australia for a number of months and could n't shake the accent when he got back , so it was kept in the film . As for Tropic Thunder , he 's supposed to be a Russell Crowe parody .

1 Dubstep has actually been around since the 90 's in Britain . For some reason it has become popular recently in the US but it 's turned into something different .

1 I cut my hair full military for GI Joe II and 30s slicked-back look in Lawless . It did not affect the number of bad guy roles I got . It only changed the background of the bad guy . It went from the unsuspecting bank president that 's in reality a killer to a sheriff that seems to be a good guy but you find out he 's not instead of biker / mafia / bouncer / badass . Still the same gig . Big , ugly , intimidating .

1 Actually , even crazier , I 've heard rumors that the original ending that Crispin Glover had such a problem with , which then started his whole mess with the producers , that at the end , the McFly 's were clearly wealthy , were about to move to another house more befitting of their wealth , and had black servants who referred to them as `` Sir . '' Probably a good thing that change was made .

1 It 's like Pop-Tarts .

1 The series is a lot different now then it was in the beginning , the beginning it did n't have too hot ratings and was n't really a huge success ( despite what it 's become now a days ) , but it 's definitely picked itself up greatly with Fast Five

1 Watched it and really enjoyed it . Appreciate the suggestion !

1 This , and Avatar . Also consider Death proof , it contains a variety of scenes that may be useful for examining tv settings ( day , night , interior , exterior , black & white , color , warm tones and human skin , cold tones with sky and greenery ... ) .

1 Julia Roberts being cast in that role still kills me to this day . She is the absolute worst . WORST ever .

1 Have you seen Moon ( 1994 ) ? You probably have n't , but you should definitely check it out . It stars underrated actor Sam Rockwell and it 's directed by David Bowie .

1 Oh I am grateful it 's a thing and I 'm grateful RDJ is doing this . I just mean I wish there no need for a thing like this . The idea of a childrens hospice is a saddening thing .

1 After taking a moment to look at photos of Al Capone and Mickey Cohen , it 's pretty clear it 's definitely not Al Capone .

1 I actually feel it 's greater now in comparison to modern movies . The effects with models look so much better than most modern CGI . There 's no other old sci-fi I 've seen in recent years that looks better . 2001 maybe , but that 's it . I 'm a huge fan of old sci-fi , so I watch a lot .

1 * Really ? * a list of movies voted on by the public does not conform to my critical standards ? Well I never ! * adjusts monocle *

1 Exactly

1 Why do all the hate groups get to have strikingly good logo designers ?

1 Gone with the Wind ? Oh wait ...

1 Clearly its not here .

1 That is some very heavy photoshop .

1 That stinks . Within the last year or so , I 've started going to the movies regularly , and it is a great experience . But I would n't go if I were you either . Also , I 've never opened my inbox to a wall of text . http : / i.imgur.com / HPkGn87.gif

1 Well , we know it 's bad , but personally that does n't concern me because I 'm not going to see it .

1 I think he meant the actual photograph of Bush used to compare with the film should have been one taken at a similar angle to the head on the stick , not that they should have shown George Bush head on in the film .

1 When NPH re-enacted the underwear scene from Birdman .

1 How the ... what ... why ... EDIT : After finishing the video , I now realize my calling in life . This truly was an eye-opening experience , and my confusion was just the result of speaking too soon . It all makes sense now .

1 yup ! as shown in the state name Penn * sylva * nia

1 First picture i saw ... http : / matsu-sensei.deviantart.com / art / You-Me-Here-There-Cel-227431726 Was not dissapointed .

1 Totally . Everything about it screams 1980 's cocaine and Ferraris .

1 I love that even in a guilty pleasure thread , someone would downvote this .

1 Director 's cut of Wolverine comes out tomorrow I believe . I will be picking that up .

1 No man left behind !

1 Please explain what they 've been doing over and over again .

1 > & lt ; > WTF MAN .

1 more than that , it 's embarrassing .

1 they way overdid it on the camera-circling-the-actors thing . It started to be distracting

1 I 've always loved the dirty hands scene https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=8YnNC38SPJ4

1 Nothing to feel guilty about there . That movie 's damn near perfect !

1 He looks like an animorph stuck mid-transformation .

1 Well Marvel did say they would tease their next film after the credits and that was the only clip after them .

1 OK , fair enough . I guess I 'm just a bit sick of seeing it . Kinda assumed that everyone knew about this seeing as it 's been posted about a hundred times .

1 Ehhh ... I mean , I like it too , but it 's not a perfect movie . It 's a fantastic thought experiment , but as a film ? Not so much .

1 I ca n't speak for anyone else , but the story of a young woman on the verge of nunhood facing 1 ) her Jewish ethnicity , 2 ) the horrors practiced by fellow Catholics in the war , and 3 ) the temptations of life outside the nunnery is enough to bring up a lot of big questions about history , morality and identity ; for Ida , the character , of course , but also for Poland at large ( no doubt in a post-war identity crisis itself ) . The greatest accomplishment of the movie , though , to me , is * how * it dramatizes this . It does n't do it predominately with dialogue , as many movies do ( you might say lazily ) . We have crumbling buildings , orderly compositions , a black and white aesthetic that is n't really black and white , but grey , greyer , and less grey . There are countless examples of exemplary composition in the movie , but [ here 's the first I found when searching ] ( http : / 4.bp.blogspot.com / -E_l_eAZxg_M / VMWbOyQM21I / AAAAAAAADKc / e_sq7KxeuE8 / s1600 / Ida.jpg ) . Where does your eye look first ? Second ? Third ? Fourth ? Fifth ? Sixth ? The point is there are * six * places to look , it 's full of dramatic information and is an adventure just to look at . What information might you pick up at each `` eye stop '' ? It 's the kind of still you could use as a writing prompt ( i.e. , `` Imagine what 's going on in this scene and write a short story about it '' ) . [ Here 's another ] ( http : / 1.bp.blogspot.com / -GxDA9FJsg7E / VMWa7s-sb7I / AAAAAAAADKE / qByOQNMfWzM / s1600 / idacoltrane.jpg ) . Count the points of interest . Why might the guy in the foreground be out of focus , etc ? A lot of movies are celebrated for their cinematography for how beautiful they look , and that 's fine , but * this * , to me , is rich cinematography . You do n't just take it in as a whole , you 're almost * forced * to explore the scene . It 's visual , filmic storytelling , not a filmed play , which is really what most movies are . Beautiful indeed ! EDIT : Tidied up a bit .

1 I feel like I have no soul because I did n't even tear up during that movie . Still a great movie though .

1 Ted made over $ 500,000,000 worldwide on a $ 50 million budget . Yes , it was successful .

1 Because the selfish bastards are spending all their time finishing their movies .

1 God damn ... they were so close to getting out . It really catches you off guard too 'cause you 're worried most about Derek .

1 I 'd recommend it if you like martial arts movies . Kind of reminded me of The Raid : Redemption

1 Yes

1 The 76 Damien was actually a blond kid so they could get the fair skin tone .

1 An idiot does . This girl is an idiot .

1 Do n't forget The Brave Little Toaster .

1 Watched that movie with an ex-gf when it came out , she was pissed at the ending . I agree with the `` depressing '' sentiment .

1 who the fuck said it did ? we just do n't need the circlejerk every single time he 's mentioned . it 's seriously posted every month in TIL

1 I am the walrus

1 Wow . That 's crazy how much they 've improved . Esp. Kate . Hard to believe it 's the same person .

1 Philip Seymour Hoffman is also my favorite working actor ( I got it right away as well ) . [ Him going to rehab for heroin ] ( http : / www.tmz.com / 2013 / 05 / 30 / philip-seymour-hoffman-detox-narcotics-heroin-drugs-abuse / ) ( ! ) was pretty shocking . I always thought his performance in Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead nailed the absolute self-loathing of drug addiction ...

1 You * just * missed it , bro . It moves at 20:02 .

1 Ah man that scene 's awesome . I love how the director changes from the bright flourescent elevator lighting to a dimmer and more intimate light for their kiss , and then right back to the harsh lighting when the bad guy gets his head stomped on .

1 So did I , no regrets .

1 Those people are such fucking jerks .

1 What ? Love was only mentioned twice in the film . The first time by Amelia when they 're discussing which planet go to , and then the second time by Cooper in the tesseract . The first time was amazingly well-delivered for such a cheesy line , and made me respect Hathaway even more . The second time , though , I admit , though was too much . `` LOVE , TARS . LOVE . THE LOVE BETWEEN ME AND MURPH . IT IS QUANTIFIABLE . '' Come on . More subtlety less exposition please .

1 People would complain if the movies did n't blend together and now they complain because they do .

1 The rest of his posting history does though .

1 I find The Incredibles and Wall-E awesome too .

1 Ted . Alaska .

1 for me ?

1 Wow ! That sucked !

1 Joss knows his shit . This will surely show up somewhere in the Marvel universe , be it Thor or Avengers .

1 No one asked you to be a dick . It was a simple request , out of decency for other people using the site .

1 Andy Dick Tracy Morgan Freeman

1 ... that 's not what that means .

1 OMG ! Are you talking about sex ?

1 I do n't think you know what anti-hero means .

1 There are n't many movies as good as Brick .

1 _~ * ^ L O V E ^ * ~ _

1 Warning : Irreversible will fuck you up .

1 I think he means they did that for the non-imax screening , which makes more sense and lines up with the images .

1 That still only counts as one !

1 Maniac had the best use of POV shots I 've ever seen in a horror movie .

1 The studio did n't want a full blown rape scene ? Shocking .

1 And Ewan McGregor is easy on the eyes .

1 `` Maria divorced me and probably took a ton of my money fund . ''

1 This film definitely needs more love . It is both religious and anti-religious at the same time .

1 To be fair , George Lucas has n't crossed genres . He 's just been taken with CGI and lost some of his creativity .

1 I 'm pretty sure he was in the bar they were in after he rescued the group of soldiers .

1 bathe in his wealth and power until he dies gloriously .

1 American Psycho would be rated L4 / V5 / B4 / H1 / N5 . Kind of a mouthfull for the end of a trailer on TV

1 I do n't know . Hannibal Lecter was only in Silence of the Lambs for like 16 minutes , and he * made * that film . Likewise with Ledger .

1 Hell , they just pour a scoop in my hands at my theater .

1 You did n't see Emilys nude scene .

1 looks like you were downvoted by fanboys

1 $ 350 million globally . I 'd say so .

1 Those things did n't happen in real life . In reality , the escape by the Americans was much less dramatic ( insofar as they had no problems at the airport ) .

1 That 's part of the Pinocchio theme . He will get one once he starts to lie .

1 I enjoyed 3 wayyy more than 2 , but the first is still probably the best .

1 I 'm sure it was the same for Brokeback Mountain . The heavy favorite gets upset sometimes and the Academy seems to fall in love with movies about actors , theater , etc . That 's the main reason why I believe that 's how the voting is going to shake out .

1 I 'm not even reading these comments about the film and I want to cry again .

1 Nobody told me ! I better get started ... .

1 They definitely wo n't use CGI , but maybe subtle makeup like in The Theory of Everything . The aging makeup in that was terrific .

1 Oh , man , I hope you do n't live in the jack - off attic .

1 That was kind of the point of the film , IMHO .

1 Absolutely , but I do n't think that Sauron had to poop after the Ring was made . If I was the Dark Lord , power one would be `` No Pooping . '' You are at your most vulnerable on the crapper .

1 He was better in Billy Madison

1 It changes every time . They 'll likely lighten it up a bit next time , but they ca n't go full Roger Moore . You never go full Roger Moore .

1 Yeah , this was her only feature film . Hollywood was n't her thing . Saw an interview where her college buddies teased her relently for probably her most famous line . > `` Carrie does homework mostly at night ... .Mostly '' She took it all in good fun .

1 It 'll probably have less extreme violence and no LGBT teenagers , though .

1 I Love You Phillip Morris , though it felt way more like a Jim Carrey movie than an indie queer movie . It was so good .

1 > This whole Boston / Irish American theme `` Theme '' , I do not think that word means what you think it means ...

1 The Director of Photography , or Cinematographer , is in charge of lighting . So maybe he was adjusting the lighting , or looking for more lights to adjust the lighting , who knows !

1 Nicolas Cage in everything

1 Firing up Reddit is Fun

1 I love the books ... movie i could n't get through yet ( seen nightwatch way too late and kept falling asleep , my bad )

1 Do n't listen to him , he 's full of shit on that one . I remember seeing the Special Edition in 97 . That trilogy informed so much of my later taste in cinema , and each subsequent viewing has brought something new to light . As my age advances , my perspective also changes . I am not the same person I was when I was 8 years old . My opinions of Star Wars have likewise changed with time . I think a valid criticism would be `` do not fully trust someone 's opinion on a movie they last saw more than a decade ago '' . I believe that my current opinion on Star Wars is 100 % justified . Also , there was a lot of stuff that I thought totally sucked as a kid , and still sucks today . Nostalgia does not paint everything from your childhood in a positive light .

1 Man going through these is making me realize how much garbage I really watch .

1 He deserves a bit more happiness after the pitfalls he had recently , but he had a good crew . A good crew is n't everything , you got ta have something extra . Love . You can write all the scripts in the world , but you take a movie to the theater that you do n't love , she 'll shake you off just as sure as a turn of the worlds . Love keeps her in the box office when she oughta bomb , tells you she 's plot-holed before she 's filmed . Makes her a fandom .

1 Squeak , squeaker.. squeak . Squeaketh ?

1 The T-rex well be played by Depp who has a four minute musical number with Burton 's wife playing a raptor .

1 As soon as I saw it was a list , I closed the tab . Shit is useless .

1 Norton was charming and likeable . Ruffalo was constantly on the verge of anger and blowing up . Your choice . An easy one if you know anything about the character .

1 You want 90 's everything ? Go to portland .

1 I would think the cinder block lined rec room would be easier to go through than the reinforced concrete of the ditch embankment .

1 Great movie ! I loved it . It looked really realistic and the last scene was heartbreaking .

1 It was like a one week thing , but the DVD goes on sale soon !

1 Pun thread request denied .

1 I think the things that make people not go `` ugh '' about this movie , is that the events of this movie are going to have some SERIOUS implications on the rest of the MCU . It 's comic book arc development . It 's so fucking cool .

1 Avatar and Transformers : Dark of the Moon have amazing 3d effects .

1 Spoony is the fuckin man

1 Gantoris had an amethyst bladed , rainbow-cored extendable blade lightsaber . Then Kyp Durron got to tool about with it . Corran Horn had a silver bladed lightsaber .

1 12:30

1 I 'd say its a sub-genre of drama . If you think about it , a lot of movies could fall into that category .

1 OP welcome to 2003

1 I loved the first one but could n't really get into the second .

1 Lana * Lana * * LANNNNNNNNNNNAAAAA * what Dangerzone

1 I 'm glad someone mentioned this one ! Watching it is a unique experience . I 've learned not to watch it before going to sleep , though . Last time I tried I got some really weird dreams from it .

1 I do n't know why you think that , clearly the main theme was always meant to be man vs nature , and Pinbacker was the personification of that conflict

1 Read and expected the same . Just left me feeling super depressed and in no way satisfied .

1 Go to Cougarlife.com and be sure to use the promo code : Austin .

1 No , just turned 13 last week .

1 Budget , it does n't cost as much and you do n't need to spend a lot of time getting the colors right for the sets / clothes . Certain films just work better in B & W over colour . For example I think a lot of noir films work better in B & W while films like the Wizard of Oz work better in colour . I know Spielberg wanted to make Schindler 's List in B & W because it was an old story for him and the only reference points he had was B & W photos and news or documentaries on TV .

1 I read this comment once before heading to work ( night-time security guard , works alone , in a 200+ year old building that 's probably haunted ) . Every fucking time I peeked into a room and turned on a light I could just hear * clickclickclickclick * in my head

1 It is worth your time . Please watch it .

1 The scene in goodfellas where all the dead bodies are being discovered while that Clapton song plays . I can not hear that song without picturing dead bodies in garbage trucks .

1 You 're actually completely wrong here . It seems you think she 's suing for copyright infringement , she 's not . She 's suing WB for breaching the contract she had with New Line . This is a contract case , not an IP one .

1 His part in * Twelve Monkeys * is possibly the best depiction of insanity I 've ever seen . He was the best part of * Burn After Reading * , too ( which is saying something , given the cast ) . He really made me worry about the security of my shit .

1 It looks like something from one of those Taiwanese news reenactments ...

1 Oh , it has an amazing cast . Kyle Chandler , Mark Strong , Joel Edgerton , Jason Clarke ...

1 He-Man basically is Conan .

1 Because people like him and go to see things he 's in ?

1 Hans Zimmer fucking killed it in that opening scene .

1 You can further point out that the director doing this movie did the exact same thing , and also before with Star Trek 2 's villain .

1 PLEASE DO ARNOLD , I LOVE THAT SPEECH !

1 Are you watching closely ?

1 No , Prometheus gets shit on because it was full of plot holes and poor characterisations .

1 A child was able to do it because it wasnt physical , it was spiritual .

1 Argo .

1 Seriously . So much easier . If not one day , then definitely one weekend . Why bother choosing when you can simply have both ?

1 `` Space Odysseus '' would probably make for a good movie , too . Trojan Space Horses .

1 I hate to undermine the effort you put into this , but you 're not the first .

1 She 's actually fleshy colour in the film ... human skin-toned Smurfs , if you will .

1 Lord of war should definitely be on this list .

1 Looks like a grounded Men in black

1 Free Mahi Mahi , free Mahi Mahi , but then gravity snatched the poor boy and he fell down like a rag doll

1 Except I want to go to DisneyLand .

1 you might enjoy http : / www.reddit.com /r/moosearchive / comments / 1wflhm / archive / cf1j9pi

1 She was the lead in Freaks & Geeks , the hot as fuck boss-lady in Grandma 's boy and Velma in the Scooby Doo movies .

1 The taste of an old vagina

1 1 , a CHURCH ! ! ! Why ! ?

1 Jim Carey was pretty awesome

1 The first time Ace sees her in the movie I believe he says `` Holy testicle Tuesday ! ''

1 I often go into it without perceived notions , and watch it . I may brief over a log line or some non-spoiler descriptions , but that 's all . After I watch it I may look at the crew as a whole . Not just `` that one actor '' . Most judge movies based on who 's in it . When there 's * so * much more to it than who 's on-screen . Then overall I get my thoughts of the film . People generally do n't care that I enjoyed Antonio S ? nchez 's music in Birdman , but as I 've said , look it as a whole . On and off-screen . I 'm sure I could get more in-depth on what I look into , but sometimes when I talk about my opinion on stuff I enjoy , I feel like I 'm being a douche , when actually I just have fun looking at the big picture . And this is n't just for films . You said `` watching them all does n't seem efficient '' , just watch the biggest controversial ones . I watched * Birdman * , * Boyhood * , * Whiplash * and * American Sniper * .

1 Not true .

1 African or European ?

1 * boiyoiyoiyoiyoinng *

1 > hilarity ( is that a word ? ) yeah bro you good

1 Funny , I was n't interested in even seeing the second PotA , but I agree on the action label as well for those type of movies , I 'd even throw in Oblivion and Jupiter Ascending in there also , but Guardians was downright hilarious , did n't take it self seriously and that was part of it 's charm . But I like action movies just as much as Sci-fi , so while I think the next Terminator is pretty stupid , I 'll happily pluck down a few bucks to be entertained at Arnie 's corny one liners as well . Same goes for the next Mad Max . But I was seriously waiting for both Interstellar and this one . Was pissed that it was only on a few screens last week . The think I really like is the CG tech is finally getting to where the visuals are cool and they can do things that are `` out of this world , '' Could you imagine what the Twilight Zone would be with current CGI tech ? But not all movies need a strong story , some are only those Friday night visual feasts . I look at Edge of Tomorrow for that kind , do n't need to think about the underlying questions too hard , but you can if you want too . I personally liked both of Blomkamp 's movies , but some people do n't like `` in your face '' treatises on injustice included with their Sci-fi . It 's * one * of the reasons why the SW prequels were so derided . I actually think this was closer in subject to Transcendence , but agreed it 's more of a thinking man 's kind . So I liked it personally as well . I had a couple places that I have issues with , but overall it made you think , `` What about * this ? * `` It 's like Hollywood is rediscovering how to popularize hidden gems like when they twisted `` Do androids dream of electric sheep ? '' or Total Recall . Sure the suits are fucking it up , but the underlying concepts are still getting out there . Just like 1984 or Fahrenheit 451 are in popular culture . I just watched Jodorowski 's Dune , now that would have been interesting if it had been made , yet he still influenced so many of all of these movies .

1 Awesome movie ! Hilarious .

1 Summer of 1982 : E.T . , The Road Warrior , Tron , The Thing , Star Trek 2 : The Wrath of Khan , Rocky 3 , Poltergeist , Fast Times at Ridgemont High , Conan the Barbarian and Blade Runner .

1 Two good friends read the books and were incredibly excited for the film because of how successful the Hairy Potter adaptation was around then . After we left the theatre they were apologizing profusely . They were genuinely embarrassed after bringing me along to see it and have it end up being complete garbage . Ca n't say I hate it , but it was a complete waste of time and money . A shame , too , considering how successful it could have been .

1 The camera style for the combat scenes are some of my favorite .

1 Masquerade of the Red Death ? Maybe not the title . But it is reminiscent of Edger Allen Poe 's story . Edit : Made by Roger Corman same title .

1 Chasing Amy in Chasing Amy .

1 That 's what I call my ex-gf .

1 1993

1 Thank you . I wonder why fans of the first one worry . It will be fine !

1 What was open to interpretation ? I thought it was pretty obvious that he heard the whistle and it would be pretty ridiculous if he walked away without finding him .

1 Honestly I was surprised too . I thought it had been a while , so I checked . I did n't expect had been 7 years .

1 Of course it 's always debatable when it comes to taste , I just feel the English version to be a bit lacking in emotions .

1 I 'm not denying that every few years a movie comes around that is slightly out of the norm , with that in mind , 90 % of every superhero movie made in the past 15 years follows the same basic pattern of a giant company funding a big movie

1 I guess in terms of creativity guardians and hellboy are superior . But there 's is n't a real world source to compare it to . As opposed to subtly making someone realistically old . I do n't agree with it , but I can see the argument

1 Definitely should , it 's absolutely brilliant .

1 HELLO MY FELLOW HUMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME AND WATCH A MOVIE WITH ME AND EAT FOOD LIKE NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS DO AND THEN FEEL HUMAN EMOTIONS WHILE WATCHING THE MOVIE ? PLEASE RESPOND .

1 That 's a silly thing to say .

1 Watch the opening of Fight Club , for instance . When Tyler 's holding the gun it sounds like it 's made of legos . The slightest motion results in clicking sounds .

1 Fuck ! Danny Trejo was going to be my favorite part of that movie !

1 I consider it a classic it actually made me laugh , and has some real heart to it . Also some of the most original characters .

1 [ smiles ] People always say the same thing . They say , `` You do n't have to do this . '' This is the best I can do . Call it .

1 Watson get out of * my * eye

1 the third one is going to be excellent if the progression from 1 to 2 is of any indication .

1 Jesus man , that must be exhausting . I have to give myself at least a year or two between watchings of this one .

1 That 's actually a really good movie .

1 Agreed , her tone was that of a teen feeling they were old enough to do something mature and she wanted to do it with Leon .

1 According to IMDB they are , and his first and only marriage ! 1978 to present and 3 children . That 's pretty awesome , by both Hollywood and non-celebrity marriage lengths .

1 Even better : > `` Do n't be so gloomy . After all it 's not that awful . You know what the fellow said ? in Italy , for thirty years under the Borgias , they had warfare , terror , murder and bloodshed , but they produced Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance . In Switzerland , they had brotherly love , they had five hundred years of democracy and peace ? and what did that produce ? The cuckoo clock . So long Holly. ``

1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ru Y ? N ? do Izu Kiru * All You Need Is Kill * It 's a nice little novella , neat concept , different ending than the Cruise film . If you like manga , there 's an excellent and faithful adaptation by Takeshi Obata ( * Death Note , Bakuman * ) that 's well worth checking out .

1 I thought that was funny as hell .

1 > Every fucking thread . Every fucking thread .

1 Well , its been 4 years . Technology advances quite quickly .

1 Listen to Cronenberg 's commentary on that , it 's great .

1 Kill Bill Vol . 1 & 2 in one long movie .

1 His royalties from The Pianist are dwindling .

1 No , its in defense of reddit . There is nothing surprising about racist people being racist when they are given a platform to speak from . Sharing your views and opinions is part of reddit , but somehow it is a fault of reddit that a few people share their racist ideas ? God forbid that you have to read an opinion you find unsavoury or disagreeable . End of the day , if you want filtered viewpoints and discourse , turn off the internet and watch TV .

1 I loved the Bourne movies : \\

1 the wolf has the contacts , the wolf knew what to do in any situation . Also in terms of script since Pulp Fiction was just Tarantino and Avery showing off their skills why not throw in that stuff , its well written and memorable .

1 What about Terminator Genocyst ?

1 ''People always ask me if I know Mr. Bean ''

1 Megamind was n't half bad as far as kids movies go .

1 But it is in OP 's list . Under TDK .

1 She was fantastic in Private Benjamin but this speech remains one of my favorites .

1 I always felt that those types of messages never really hurt kids . Sure , it might set them up for disappointment when they realize they are n't a special snowflake , but ultimately that 's a life lesson and will be learned as they get older . Better to let kids hope and dream . In low income neighborhood , the optimistic kids with goals are far more likely to stay out of gangs , go to college , or put off having children . I 'm not saying movies like this solves the problem , but when everyone around you ends up in jail , shot , or with a substance abuse issues , well- these movies show you another option of what * could be *

1 Me either , but mainly because that would mean he 's got the longest torso known to man kind .

1 Yeah , I saw it at the midnight screening the night it came out and everyone seemed to like it . There were a few audible groans with Jar Jar but the crowd was entertained . It was n't until later that people really hated on it .

1 I know what you mean . I saw the Japanese version when I was 9 ( grew up in Asia ) and the apartment I lived in had TVs in the bedrooms around a corner and short corridor from the living room . When I was home alone I would always stare out the corner of my eye dreading that I 'd see Sadako turn that corner walking towards me .

1 I would assume so .

1 Yeah , see , I interpreted those remarks as `` I 'm not a girl , I 'm a vaaaaampire '' .

1 Check out On The Road . The movie is mostly just * ok * , but his portrayal of Dean Moriarty ( / Neal Cassidy ) makes the movie entirely worth it .

1 Really , anything from Fight Club belongs on here . `` You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake . ''

1 A great big bushy beard !

1 Not alone but you are are the minority .

1 Yep . That was * depressing * .

1 Mh , I kinda liked it . I did n't exactly have high expectations going in , I had n't read any reviews or seen any score on RT or imdb , and I figured with mostly Ryan Reynolds as the cast , how good could it be ? I was pleasantly surprised .

1 I had two theories ... * That each actor was the same soul reincarnated * The the comet-birthmark character in each era was the same soul re-incarnated ( and whomever was their love interest was also the same soul in each era ) . Since Tom Hanks ' characters altered between good and evil , main and non-main characters , I am leaning towards the comet theory . Except for Hugo Weaving 's authoritarian characters .

1 Who hurt you ?

1 This a million . First mention of Snake Eyes - great movie .

1 Definitely reminded me of a less ridiculous Archer , it even looked like he was sporting the tactleneck during the `` I work better alone '' scene .

1 Pushing Daisies got cancelled , and he decided he still wanted to pay his rent .

1 Benevolent dictator is the reason it got voted . Hitler was n't benevolent .

1 i know right ? it seems to have a bigger budget then most japans live action films

1 Hitchcock 's Rope is also basically one long tracking shot , but it 's not his most celebrated or remembered film . But the main reason why I do n't think Birdman will stand the test of time is because of it 's absurdism . Absurdism as a concept is n't really celebrated in mainstream cinema nowadays , yet in a lot of Latino-American cinema it is ( hence why Innarritu directed the film . ) I imagine it will stand the test of time with those who are interested in Latino-American cinema , but as a mainstream movie I doubt it will . Still fucking great though !

1 Ca n't forget the demise of journalistic integrity for the sake of appeasing the masses .

1 I did n't know that ! Awesome . I knew that Danny McBride did the country talk , and that Kenny Loggins was on Los Santos Rock

1 Do n't forget about Gary Oldman ( Sirius Black ) . Any movie with him in it get bumped up a few notches . Too bad his character was killed off .

1 It wo n't go to court , if that 's what you mean . Despite Disney 's army of lawyers , any decent copyright lawyer could probably tell the original artist that they do , in fact , have a case , which means settlement . Disney * also * has about a gazillion dollars . I 'm sure they 'd much rather pay a settlement for less than what going to court would cost ( with lawyer fees and full compensatory damages ) . This also minimizes the negative publicity that would come with a trial .

1 They stated in the behind the scenes they could n't shoot in Mogadishu because it was to dangerous . I 'm sure they found the best place possible that the local gov would allow them to shoot in .

1 Tyrion getting knocked out instead of doing his battle was my # 1 disappointment with the first season . I wanted to watch him not only be in battle , but best people in battle , even if it was by gutting a horse .

1 Do n't worry id call his role closer to a cameo than a supporting role . He has little more than one scene .

1 I did n't think it 'd be good either , given the goofy looking lizard on the poster and the reliance on Johnny Depp 's name .

1 Daddy needs to get his carbonite off .

1 Dude , no this is a genuinely good movie . It 's exactly what it tried to be .

1 This is the only acceptable answer .

1 I would n't be surprised to learn that Tarantino * wanted * it to look a bit outrageous / fake .

1 Came looking for this - nice one !

1 Let 's not forget The Departed either .

1 You 're fooling no one , Mr Foxx .

1 RotJ is still a good film , even with the Ewoks . I 'll take ten films with Ewoks over JarJar Binks any day .

1 that article should get a remake

1 I did n't say anything about screwing with the formula . I love what they 're doing .

1 You 're the worst kind of person .

1 Should n't the 2nd line be something like `` 99 bugs in the code '' to match the cadence of the song ?

1 Which he paid for himself ( on the 3rd one ) . He put things up as collateral , he sold stuff , he got the money together himself . Urban is n't doing that . He is n't putting his home up for cash to back the film or anything like that . His fandom does n't go as far as Diesel 's does ( boy , never thought I 'd utter that phrase ... )

1 You did n't pay very close attention at the end , did you ?

1 Yeah , I thought he looked like his life was n't ruined by being in that movie as a kid .

1 It made 500m+ in 22 days

1 I think that both of those films are great but you 're kind of stretching to find similarities between them

1 That 's gangsta !

1 Prometheus . Fuck me , right ?

1 This movie was making a lot of movie off ticket sales for IMAX too , which cost more then the average theatre ticket

1 If you love Prisoners , watch Incendies .

1 Moon had a lot more going for it than Sam Rockwell . Great visuals for its budget , atmosphere , decent plot . And it 's barely a twist , seeing as it 's revealed about halfway through the movie , so I do n't see how it was built around it . It pretty much * is * the movie , and what sets the events of the movie in motion . I loved Source Code , the sci-fi side of it was a bit silly but it was surprisingly touching . Though I still feel like they should 've ended it at the freeze-frame , the movie did n't need the reveal that followed .

1 `` It 's got ta be the hair , Cotton . It 's beautiful . Feathered and lethal . You just do n't see it nowadays . ''

1 Ooh , I 've agreed with every post here and then I see this . I 've seen cloud atlas at least 7 times now . I liked it a lot ! Now drive of those times are varying degrees of paying attention but still , I have no problem throwing that on any day any time .

1 I think that would actually just be R ( I * ^2 * P * ^2 * ) .

1 That 's an italian movie surprisingly , part of the Spaghetti Western sub-genre .

1 I really wanted to like this movie . An awesome cast ( as the article mentions right at the top ) , and characters I loved in the original British series . You would think watching Sir Sean chew up the scenery would always be fun . But this movie just is n't that good . I would n't call it one of the worst movies ever made , but it 's definitely a let-down .

1 It 's ... = it is.. `` It is the principle '' `` It is weird '' .. you sir are not only annoying , but also wrong .

1 the paychecks they were receiving probably kept them from saying that .

1 DADDY WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SAU-SAGE ? DAD-DY WOULD YOU LIKE SOME SAU-SA-GES ? ..err , excuse me ? ..i 'm being..creative..

1 Oscar Isaac gave the best Al Pacino performance in a long time . I really liked it . From the trailer I assumed his character was just a Sopranos-esque gangster trying to juggle a family life but he 's actually an honourable guy for the most part , which is refreshing .

1 So good and I feel like nobody watched that when it premiered . Such a heartbreaking performance .

1 Taken 3 : Took : Fool of a Took !

1 Well that 's typically because the bag guys has killed most of the inhabitants so he does n't have to worry . The only time he ever had any choice was when he went up against 19 and Gero . Every other time the bad guys picked the location or the humans dead anyway .

1 I also enjoyed Mutt , tbh . Shia 's a douche , but I do n't mind most of his movie characters . I thought his banter with Harrison was pretty good in this flick .

1 They could n't play The Interview if they wanted . Sony has yanked the release date .

1 I am 48 years old . Not edgy at all . I get your sarcasm , but all film like all art is aesthetic . How does it taste . Clockwork tasted awful to me . I am a cinephile -- I have seen probably 2000 movies maybe more -- this movie left a bad taste in my mouth -- I have seen it three times and I have resolved to not watch it again . : - ) I am sure its just me

1 > In fact this is n't even a question , just an excuse to rant about why movies you like are n't that successful . You just summed up half of /r/movies . The other half is busy doing the exact opposite .

1 I did n't know it was the same director . Blue Ruin was great .

1 Over looked masterpiece in my opinion .

1 2001 and There will be Blood are two of my personal favorites . Very well made pieces of art .

1 sorry man if they 're nth new for you , but a lot of people like myself might have n't seen these yet

1 Sounds like a porn spinoff . Think of the marketing opportunities !

1 They just need to show talking apes eating burgers on TV and it 'll make a lot of money .

1 It 's a bit generic story-wise , but it 's worth the watch just for the massive scale and impressive kryptonian battle scenes

1 I kind of agree . I mean it was a beutifully shot and well crafted film as far as special effects and CGI is concerned , but like , if you 're ognna spend years and years , and millions of dollars developing this awesome technology for movies , ca n't you at least make the characters a little more likable and interesting . Why was she nominated for an academy award fo that movie ? I dunno , I think I 'm biased just because I strongly dislike Sandy Bullock in general as an actress .

1 So all we have to do now is wall it off .

1 There are dozens of us !

1 The top comment is perfect ... > Let 's rephrase that . `` He 's the godfather of my ? stepdaughter , and a personal friend . His name 's Charlie ... Charlie , uh ... I forget his name .

1 Being severely disabled is actually an advantage . Bond villains almost always have something physically wrong with them . A wheelchair , webbed toes , a third nipple , numbness , albinism + spattering of diamonds embedded in the skin . It 's reliable enough that in one of them a twist that someone was actually evil was foreshadowed by somebody mentioning she had a horrible ear wound that she covers with her hairstyle .

1 If only you knew how wrong that statement was ...

1 Not to mention the flying moose head couch , pumpkinhead friend , and the room full of heads .

1 Borderlands flat out stole that from Mad Max . There 's even a character in the first game called Mad Mel . Good lord . Know your history .

1 `` I hate fun . '' - / u / Tireless_Love_Muscle

1 And now I 'm just thinking of Minority Report : )

1 Could not have said it better . When Godzilla showed up it was like * hell yes * but it was after about an hour and a half of generic disaster movie shtick . Pacific Rim hits you from the word go , and only has about 20 minutes of down time . Godzilla definitely has more clout , but the MUTOs were just so dull .

1 Maybe this : `` YOUTH Without Youth , ? Francis Ford Coppola ? s first film in 10 years , is about Dominic Matei , an elderly Romanian professor of linguistics who , after being struck by lightning , becomes young again . Though Matei , played by Tim Roth , retains a septuagenarian ? s memories and experiences , his body , restored to 30-year-old fighting trim , is mysteriously immune to the effects of time .

1 I 've watched and enjoyed plenty worse .

1 I love these movies .

1 If you read the book you 'd also know that Israel was for the most part successfully quarantined . And North Korea was sort of quarantined in that no people can get in and as far as we know know one got out but it 's entirely possible they all got zombified in underground bunkers .

1 [ Nope ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / j7vQW1m.jpg )

1 Yes , by a long way . For the price you 'd have to look up your IMAX 's website , and it 'd also be worth checking if it 's a real IMAX or a Liemax to know whether you 'll be getting the best possible experience or not .

1 No Country For Old Men . Simply ... perfection .

1 Pregnant Schoolgirl Anal . I figured that would get a lot of attention , It appears to have worked .

1 It 's a terrible movie , what do you expect ?

1 I 'd switch out Predator with Lethal Weapon . I do n't remember him being in Predator at all .

1 Yeah , we know .

1 terds *

1 No , but they will tell you it was bad on purpose , as an homage to old giant monster movies . I 've seen that 'argument ' several times on here .

1 Start with Goldeneye . It has plenty of action , a good villain , actors she might recognize , and it was the first Bond film in six years , so it was made to introduce Bond to a newer generation .

1 Because someone who has n't been able to see their whole life or for a significant period of their life will not be disoriented when thrust into deep darkness , unlike someone who is used to depending on their vision in even darkness . Try turning the lights off on your room and walking across - you will automatically wait for your night vision to kick in to orient yourself .

1 `` I hate those fucking dolphins . ''

1 No , it is n't and no , it has n't . What it has , is chunky , cheesy dialogue . It lacks logic . The acting is awful , even Jean Reno could n't save it . Well , maybe this is a bit too harsh , alright , BUT , and that 's what counts : it literally STOMPS its source material . Godzilla , as a monster , is a cult classic . The hollywood movie just did n't treat it like that . In some ways , it is kind of like a video game adaption . Just do , what has worked in the source material and stop imprinting it all over with your hollywood streamlining .

1 Bladerunner was bloody amazing .

1 The girl with the big ears I think is Nei , from _Phantasy Star_ .

1 Also , he 's not really explaining it to her because she does n't know ... he 's explaining it to her to keep her talking and to keep her calm so she stops wasting so much oxygen by freaking out .

1 I think they tried to , but got confused and instead did Jim Carrey .

1 I 'm usually very wary of sequels to cult fare like this but I think Stiller has a real affinity for the character and can be trusted .

1 Heck yeah . Jackie Brown is one of my favs too .

1 BOTH M8

1 If you 're interested in seeing the second movie in the theater , you better go see it fast . It opened at # 8 in the US box office , so it 's gon na be gone fast ... .

1 I do n't think they could use the headpiece if they wanted to , since they need to avoid relating her to Magneto ( which is dumb . )

1 Scarlet Witch makes an observation about Ultron 's personality to Captain America , and then asks who he thinks Ultron got it from alluding to Tony Stark . Even though the structure for the AI came from the scepter , the underlying protocols that motivated Ultron were based on Stark 's work .

1 Watched the trailer for it and yes they have no clue how to hold a camera . There is a finnish director Jouko Turkka whos every film is ruined by extremely shitty use of camera . Only good example i found on youtube was The Unknown Soldier remake from the 70 's . It has most of the best finnish actors , it is based on a great book and there is a great film made in 1955 . And still he manged to fuck up the film with the horrendeus use of the camera . [ Clip ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=rT8_ePT5ZwA ) .

1 To be fair , Steve Buscemi in * anything *

1 a sequel with benefits . at that point it really is n't a reboot anymore .

1 Well Raimi was going to make Spiderman 4 at one point so he could have been saving Connors change for that . And it was surprising that they rebooted the franchise so quickly . They could have continued after the Raimi films with the same cast and had conners become the lizard that way .

1 lol anyone who disagrees with has to be a crusader huh ? Ca n't just be someone with a different opinion ?

1 I had that moment when my mom rented a movie from blockbuster and it started with a trailer for Batman Returns . I ended up getting grounded because I kept rewinding it , dad got super pissed off .

1 It was around 3 hours when I saw it . Maybe a little less or more . My wife and I ca n't seem to agree . I want to say around 2:50 . I will say though that it did n't feel as long as it was ( until I realized at the end that I really needed the restroom ) .

1 L.A . Motherfucking Confidential .

1 She kinda was the best thing in that movie . I loved Carey Mulligan , but she played the 60s trophy gf so well that she perfectly personified what Mulligan would never _want_ to be .

1 BeboFamous : `` Whats your set play for tomorrow Coach '' Basketball Coach : `` You shall not pass '' BeboFamous : `` But Coach..nevermind ''

1 It 's really unfair to make that kind of judgement just based on a short article . From the article Zimmer says : `` In a peculiar way , what Chris wrote down that day , and what he wanted from me , had more to do with my story than the plot of the movie . He knows how to get under my skin. That 's the game we play . '' I could completely see this being a legitimate directors strategy . You do n't always reveal your cards to your cast , or crew when making a movie . Sometimes mysterious elements can make things more fun , add an extra edge , etc . It 's a common directing technique to change the emotional direction of a scene by giving secret direction to 1 actor in order to catch the other actor in a real , raw reaction . On the same note , Nolan and Zimmer have a looong history together . I guarantee they know each other very well , and I would bet Christopher Nolan wants to get something extremely personal from Zimmer - not restricted by the confines of the script . And this is probably the best way to do it . He wrote 1 page that elicited a strong emotional reaction from Zimmer , and then he trusted that what will come out of Hans will be powerful and moving , and , somehow , believes that it will fit within the scope of the film . Christopher Nolan is no amateur . He is n't doing this out of some pretentious hype for his film to be seen as 'guarded in secrecy . ' I guarantee that .

1 You can agree with or say things that are similar to a faith . I like certain things in the Bible , but I 'm not Christian . Obama likes things in the Qu'ran , but that does n't mean he 's Muslim . Shit , I do n't care what movies they come up with as long as they 're good enjoyable Sci-Fi . Obviously if it 's like Battlefield , then hell no . The fact that I do n't believe the stories in the Bible does n't mean I do n't enjoy The Ten Commandments .

1 Exactly . That 's apparently ok , according to the Supreme Court in another farcical , `` literalist '' decision

1 People are watching it with different standards .

1 If you ca n't figure out what JLA means when included in the same sentence as Batman and Superman , then I 'm not sure why you 'd even care .

1 Local whites call themselves haole . Half-whites call themselves hapa-haole . Maybe it can be used in a degrading way sometimes ( i.e . You fahkin haole ) , but it can definitely be used in a neutral sense as well . Same thing with pake , pilipino , kanak , popolo , and portagee . In Hawaii discrimination is n't typically based on race , it 's based on where you 're from . Just look at the dichotomies of `` kotonk '' vs `` buddhahead '' vs `` boboran '' or `` local '' vs `` mainland '' . Local comedy reflects that distinction very well .

1 I am a tax guy . Nobody does this . People pick one church , then miscellaneous charities . Nobody just starts donating to random belief systems . Like maybe two different kinds of Lutheranism , if they move to Florida and they 're still donating to the church back home . But I 've never even seen * that * , I 'm just saying that 's more believable than donating to Scientology and any other belief system .

1 Amazing , thanks for linking that mate . Plenty more pictures from inside the theater , offering far more of a glimpse than what I posted .

1 Yes ... and that is precisely why hard-working chimpanzees win Nobel prizes .

1 I dunno . They DID bomb the shit out of the natives but did n't make them hire their contractors to rebuild it with their materials on loans their banks would give out . That just makes them people not american .

1 Yeah , I was horrified until that line . I lost it , such perfect delivery .

1 This comment will not get the recognition it deserves .

1 People like shitting on Willie for being annoying and Short Round for being kinda sorta racist and also annoying . I liked both .

1 Same here . Took my daughters , because watching the Doctor together is our thing . We got there 30 mins before the show and the theater was packed . We ended up having to sit all the way up in the first row . So many variations of the Doctor , Rose , Silence witnesses with their tallymarks . Did n't expect such a big turn out in the South .

1 That picture is not Alison Brie

1 Delicious indeed

1 My error - I thought I had Flash 10 installed , but did n't . Installed it and the few movies I 've chosen load immediately . Neat . : )

1 I agree . I also think Fellowship is so much more cohesive than the next two . It lives and breathes fluidity .

1 Fucking Brett Rat-Fucking-Ner

1 Die Hard 4.0 was more like Die Hard 0.5 to me . Die Hard 4.0 Unrated was more like Die Hard 0.8 . Not perfect , but hey at least it was a bit better .

1 ... and then talk about it on the internet as if I do .

1 Star Wars is a fairy tale set in space , a space opera if you will . It revolves around a good vs . evil story , with great action , mythology and knights , witches and princesses . Star Trek is science fiction . It focuses on character interaction , technobabble and morality tales . It 's not until later that Star Trek was given an action spin in the films , which came after the release of Star Wars . Both franchises are great , by the way . Too bad they only made three Star Wars movies though . Star Wars actually payed homage to 50s space opera films and was influenced by such things as Edgar Rice Burroughs science fantasy Barsoom series , first book published in 1912 ( which was just last year adapted to film by Disney as a commerical flop in form of 'John Carter ' ) . As for the point of the picture and many of the comments : there are just as many original movies today as there were back in the 80s . The sequel mania is so old a story it has even been feared that all books will be sequels . Why ? Just because Harry Potter # 8172 tops the charts does n't mean there are n't people working on original IP . The shift this picture shows is about consumerism . If people did n't go to see those sequels , they would n't be made . Meanwhile most people would ignore great original movies such as Moon ( 2009 ) . Last year * every * movie nominated for an Oscar was an original movie or an adaptation . If you want them to top the charts , all you have to do is see them .

1 All of it except for the exact date when Thr ? r decided to retake Khazad-dum . My knowledge pales in comparison to a lot of redditors in /r/lotr and /r/tolkienfans . Those guys know so much I sometimes think they are Tolkien .

1 You added a `` the '' too much then : )

1 Motion capture is much cheaper than raw animation , actually . It probably is n't an issue of using the budget ... it 's an issue of staying within the budget .

1 g = GM / r^2

1 only for the first movie thank god ...

1 As far as we know , not in any way whatsoever . It 's in the Man of Steel universe .

1 I really liked The Amazing Spider-Man ...

1 I agree with this . There are a TON of abandoned buildings there . They also just closed the Backlot Tour area . The replacement for that area is still in rumors . While I would like to see the park getting back into it 's routes of being about movie magic and behind the scenes kind of stuff ... ... I also would like it to become the `` Thrill Ride '' park .

1 Is n't the movie they 're comparing it to also based off a book ? Theyre similar but I would n't say rip off outright . Once Upon a Time would be considered a rip off / imitation .

1 I feel like Chigurgh sees himself as an agent of chance ; in his mind , he 's a manifestation of the vast and unwieldy machinery that determines life and death seemingly arbitrarily . And like that machinery of chance , he seems like almost an invincible phantom throughout the movie - he 's not a person , he 's a force of nature , an act of God . Getting killed by him is little different than being struck by lightning or buried in a landslide . However , the fundamental thing to me is that , in a way , Chigurgh does lose at the end of the movie . He loses all his symbolic power the instant that his car is blindsided and he 's injured , because suddenly he 's on the other side of chance - he 's now a victim . And from that moment , you recognize that he is mortal , and eventually he will get his .

1 Eating chicken has never felt so wrong .

1 Class of Nuke Em ' High is boss ! !

1 I do n't know that it has any bearing on the quality of the movie , but I do like to see it sometimes . Pete Postlethwaite has a small but crucial role in * The Town * . It also happens a lot in Terrence Malick movies , on account of his bizarre need to cut fantastic actors out of his films or reduce their roles to basically cameos . But it 's always interesting at least . I love Malick .

1 there was the one with clive owen like 8 years ago ... . and a few merlin B movies .

1 It depends on what the opinion of the thread is . If the opinion is `` up '' and yours is `` down '' you might have a rough time . If you have an opinion that goes the other way , you better post an awesome comment .

1 animation yes . overall look of the turtles , well lets just say i was waiting for eddie murphy as a donkey to pop out .

1 Actually people can die there . In a letter , Tolkien said that being there does n't give you immortality , it simply heals and restores . Bilbo , Frodo , Sam , and Gimli will all eventually die since the Valar can not change the plans of The One .

1 I try to make it a point to watch one trailer , decide if it 's worth my time and then avoid getting any more information until after I 've seen the picture . Trailers and advertising destroy the movie going experience IMHO .

1 I would have recast The Joker as Gary Busey . However , I would n't have given him a script . Just put Gary Busey in make up and told him Batman was his enemy and film his reaction in real time .

1 Certainly cleared that up ...

1 i think anything from Leslie Nielsen is cheating , everything that man said on camera was fucking hilarious

1 Horrible Bosses ? Office Space ?

1 Yup. There will never be a shootout that good again . The way the shots echo off of the skyscrapers just ca n't be replicated in a sound studio .

1 No-one was disputing that it was 50fps , they were commenting on `` Makes it hard to actually see the difference '' because at 50fps the difference is still ( as you said ) very easy to see .

1 Because he is recognizable instantly from his first name alone . That is all .

1 god damn it dude

1 Hartford . I remember because I live in the county and found it insanely cool that my state and general area were brought up haha . I did n't think the book 's ending was too dark though , it seemed like it was ending with the protagonist saying that they 've found hope and that hope could be Hartford . Then again it 's been like 8 years since I read it .

1 The old movies were well done , low budget mind , but well done . There should be no problem watching this on its own as both films before it were just one contained episode where nearly all characters die within it .

1 You know you 're actually not the first person I 've seen say that Cloud Atlas reminded them of Tree of Life . Personally , I do n't see it and ca n't really understand it . But it 's interesting to me . Makes me more aware of just how differently people view films .

1 I ca n't deny that Shia is one of the most hated actors . But he has his fans . And from what I read , he is very , very dedicated and focused when he is acting ( Too dedicated according to one of his co-stars ) . So maybe that 's why he is loved by directors .

1 HEAD = STOMPED

1 Does another great reveal as Gandalf the White in TT

1 I have n't seen 2012 , but people who are n't familiar with what Neutrinos are might find this relevant . https : / what-if.xkcd.com / 73 /

1 probably something whipped up by the art department to avoid the need to get copyright clearance .

1 Station !

1 This sounds like a really cool premise , thanks for bringing it to my attention .

1 The bulk of the movie takes place in the DC metro area ( although filmed mostly in Cleveland )

1 > The planet actually has to be within the accretion disk for the radiation to be a factor Nope , accretion disks of supermassive black holes spread deadly radiation for light years around . You do n't seem to realize that the things are actually * blazing * and generating synchrotrong radiation with all the friction and spinning at relativistic speeds . > and we do n't know the distance that any of the planets were . We know that they are very , very close to the event horizon , since there are time dilation effects . Heck , we can even * see * the disk of the event horizon in the sky . > By your logic , we should all be dead because of the Van Allen belts . You are comparing laughably different stuff here , caused by a different mechanism and orders of magnitude less energetic than a black hole . Also , even if you got away with radiation , tidal effects would probably rip the planets apart , [ as this other very annoyed guy observed ] ( http : / news.discovery.com / space / interstellar-a-missed-opportunity-review-141108.htm ) . Have you ever wondered why serious research on extrasolar habitable planets look just for main-sequence stars in the K , G and F classes ( sometimes M is considered too ) , but never for exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars ? > Second , your `` giant domes and greenhouse '' theory is fine , but let 's take into account the significant undertaking that it would be to construct these places while the planet is struggling to grow food that is being attacked by a rapidly evolving blight ( which , while far-fetched is not completely incorrect and is plausible enough to move the plot along ) . If you 're starving or barely scraping by it would be difficult to gather the manpower and materials to build these `` giant domes and greenhouses '' without even talking about the physical logistics behind this as well . So you are saying that building giant space arks to launch billions of people to space would actually be more feasible than bulding greenhouses on Earth ? And arks that presumably would also have to have artificial food production anyway to sustain people during the travel ? That assertion is not even wrong . > That being said , just because his wormhole theory is near impossible to prove or disprove because of the lack of evidence about exotic matter and the lack of understanding into the true nature of spacetime does n't mean you can discredit those theories or call the film `` inaccurate '' because you do n't subscribe to those ideas . Scientific theories * have * to be falsifiable , so you are basically saying that wormholes ca n't even be considered a scientific construct . P.S . : about the time travel stories from Heinlein , I will just say that he never wanted to market them as `` scientifically correct '' . I have no problem with scifi that deviates from the current knowledge of Science and the current scientific consensus . But I do have a moral problem with false propaganda .

1 The whole fake `` Mandarin '' schtick is what killed iron man 3 for me i was actually expecting the Mandarin and possibly Fin Fang Foom to make an appearance . So what do we get and out of work cockney loser as a fake villian , and a fake company exec as an extremis filled roid rage monkey . Ironman 3 has totally lost it , i should have known when they screwed up the whole red scorpion in IM2 they would just keep dummying down the villians and make the story so vanilla and predictable it has all the impact of a feather filled pillow swung by an anemic 4 year old .

1 Harvey Keitel played the devil in Little Nicky so he really do n't get no respect

1 I think he calls it his personality

1 His charisma locked him into my `` weird crush '' list . When Rita Repulsa exclaims `` He 's so handsome ! '' I thought , `` Hmm ... . He kind of is . '' My childhood was weird .

1 I like Clockwork , but I have to be in a certain mood to watch it .

1 People just like to shit on it because it went way over budget and only grossed 50 % of the budget domestically ( it eventually made a profit overseas , though ) . If you approach it with an open mind , it 's actually pretty good . I 'm not saying it 's the best movie ever , but there are plenty of movies more deserving of scorn than Waterworld .

1 Yep , and pretty much every Beatles doc you see is just a cut-down , re-edited , re-narrated version of some portion of the Anthology footage . If this is all the Ron Howard doc is going to be , I 'll just go watch the Anthology again . Unless he narrates it . I 'd watch that .

1 Marley & Me .

1 I would n't try to argue that Zoe Bell has chops , but I still liked her for that role .

1 The one in * The Amazing Spiderman * was pretty great , too .

1 I 'm shaving ... MOTHERFUCKER ! !

1 You 're lucky the internet 's the only place they can sass you .

1 The names Panaka and Typho both have a bit of a hard edge to them : cheesy , but capable . Phasma sounds like they looked at Lucas 's Flash Gordon source material but forgot to put it through a Star Wars filter .

1 I mean that can be said about so many great movies . 2001 has scenes going forever with seemingly no purpose . The plot of 2001 was slow and seemingly goes nowhere . One could say these things about 2001 and come to the conclusion that `` you call that a visual heavy movie , but I call it bad directing , writing , editing '' . So why is 2001 amazing but Hustle is terrible in every way ? Now before you say anything I am not trying to compare these movies by any means . 2001 is a film classic that has been and will be remembered throughout history , obviously it 's a better movie . I am simply asking why you think these `` negatives '' about hustle are negatives in this film , but not in another that has the same `` negatives '' . Negatives being in quotes because I do n't find the things you mentioned to be bad filmmaking at all . I am not trying to get in an argument where we down vote each other and call each other names , just trying to get a discussion going .

1 It 's called * dropping the personal pronoun * . It 's actually done * all the time * . For example : `` Got ta go . '' `` Hey ! Have n't seen you in ages ! '' And it is [ completely grammatically acceptable ] ( http : / people.umass.edu / aweir / Weir-UG-diss.pdf ) provided that the audience is reasonably able to follow who the subject that is being dropped , is . Now , if you were unable to figure out that puzzler , that 's a different conversation and I apologize for speaking over your head . However , this ai n't rocket surgery , here . [ Instead of making inaccurate , pointless accusations , how 'bout we stick to the subject at hand , yeah ? ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / e8FwIrY.jpg )

1 I 'd check with Map to the Stars Eddie

1 Ah I 'm used to RealD projectors ; that explains the discrepancy .

1 Heat came out before the shootout .

1 Tokarevs with rails are OPR8ER as fuck dude

1 In /r/filmnoir , there are links to recommended 'best ' lists on the sidebar .

1 Indonesia is a HUGE country ( population over 200 million ) and most people just do n't know anything about it .

1 When I get drunk I yell this . I do n't know why . I just fucking love it .

1 Controlled was perhaps the wrong word . Maybe manipulated suits better . And saying that the movie did n't have that incarnation is n't fair . He very well could have been a hulk with some sort of understanding . He fought abomination ( from what I remember ) in the movie with motive an not just rage .

1 > No one even died . Did you watch the movie ?

1 Penises ? Naw , they 're real , dawg .

1 That movie was critically acclaimed and I think won an Oscar .

1 `` It 's the fucking blood of Christ . Of course , you do n't * have to * touch it . You do n't * have to * . ''

1 Except the ones who are not .

1 Not canon anymore ! Woohoo ! So liberating !

1 Yeah , we 're counting on it !

1 I do n't think he intended it to be impressive , it 's just that story could only be told in the way it was filmed otherwise it would n't feel very organic . It 's why Birdman was filmed to look as one shot . It 's why Whiplash is filmed and edited to look like the actors are actually playing the music you hear . And can you imagine Grand Budapest Hotel with a filming style other than Anderson 's ?

1 ? cumbag Luke : Names his son after an ? ld man he knew for 3 days instead ? f after his uncle who raised him ? ll his life .

1 Hes great in justified

1 That 's french

1 And it ended up being both !

1 And I 've said a few times that I would love Huge Jackman to do an Old Man Logan , so awesome , let 's do this thing !

1 Jesus Christ he looks pretty damn good for 76 !

1 That was more entertaining then I thought it would be .

1 Seconded ! A nice little sci-fi flick that mashes Fahrenheit 451 into 1984 with some Matrix sprinkled on top .

1 You must have some amazingly smooth conversations because nothing seemed awkward about that .

1 I was thinking the same thing .

1 You just went and made a new alien ? Probably not a good idea .

1 I do n't want to brag , but I do a perfect Jim Gaffigan impression . In my head .

1 I 'm sure you spend 24 hours per day doing your job and do n't have anything you enjoy outside of work .

1 Nymphomaniac was never intended for a wide American release the way this one is .

1 I feel like the film is n't as good as the chemistry between Hader and Wiig . If those two were n't the lead actors , it probably would not have been a very good film . Luckily for us , they * are * the lead actors , and they absolutely killed it .

1 Just looked it up , 12 years a slave got a 97 %

1 Indian Food ?

1 `` Diana has put her bosom away . Apollo has lifted his skirt . The day has been launched . '' There are too many occasions when I have said this in the morning .

1 `` Where In The World is Osama Bin Laden '' was inept , vapid , and absolutely terrible . An inexcusable missed opportunity . Simply a very , very bad film . But , yeah well , that 's just like ... my opinion man .

1 Masterfully done , they knew exactly what to skip in order to still keep it fresh . No spoilers , but the `` you like 3 sugars '' scene comes to mind where they actually discuss events before we see them .

1 Released to a few festivals last year , actually released this year .

1 Without hyperbole . Literally life-changing . Kubrick has done that to me a few times .

1 We kept it in the containers ! It took some ... interesting geometry but we got the whole bucket in her purse !

1 Still though .

1 Right in the ad hominem .

1 What the fuck did you just say about Marvel / sequels I 'm looking forward to ? ! ?

1 You should submit to both ! There are certainly areas where our tastes intersect , but plenty of room for films that work better for us versus them , and vice versa . While we are primarily a premiere festival , we have an entire `` Festival Favorites '' section dedicated to films we love that have premiered elsewhere , so just because a film plays Sundance it does n't necessarily preclude playing with us . Ultimately , you should know your film and who it is for . Our audiences are movie-crazed and excited for films that have a fresh spark to them - be it an edgy comedy , zeitgeisty doc or out-of-its-mind animated short . We get to be a little rougher around the edges here , and we love it . -RF

1 i think that was just the JDM laser disk . that is the theatrical relies and unedited except for being speed up a tiny bit to fit on the disks . | the auction was supposed to have a special edition that never got put out .

1 Coz if he was black he 'd be Red War Machine

1 Your opinions are bad and you should feel bad .

1 That is super cool !

1 Odd , I thought it was just boring and very flat .

1 He should have it set to `` Lust For Life ''

1 interesting answer ...

1 lol no

1 The Departed ?

1 BA BA LUUU

1 That 's weird . I felt the last 30 seconds were the worst / most contrived of the movie ( which I loved overall )

1 Respectfully , ma'am , if you 're a field agent then you suck at it . HOLD THE DAMN TRIGGER DOWN !

1 The public library loans reasonably current movies and music .

1 The Pursuit of Happyness - Will Smith 's best work IMHO . Check it out !

1 Sure but there is a tiny bit of difference between a lot of profit and not much profit

1 Uh , yeah . Actors are n't on the entire shoot , they show up for their parts and that is it . Movies are almost never shot in the order of the final edit . Also filming locations are secured for a finite time ... Is this a real question or are you trolling ?

1 Pretty much . That and Epic Movie .

1 Sure , but I would n't exactly call this overlooked .

1 Clearly Peter Jackson plays the part of Tom Bombadil .

1 Dear Zachary was the best movie I never want to watch again . It made me see how truly broken we are a species . Even with reports of violence all over the world every day , it took a story like this for me to see how irredeemable we are . We do n't deserve to exist . Yet we do . Whether you believe there 's a reason behind all this or not , we will witness these things until our existence ceases . Even this tragedy will be forgotten in time . Nothing changes . Nothing improves . The chapter Humanity leaves on the history of the universe will be a bleak one . And I 'm not trying to say I think I 'm any better . If something like this can happen , then we 're all guilty .

1 T8 : ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? M ?

1 > ? Iron Man 3 ? is filled with distractions : impressive and showy CGI ( everywhere ) , an odd scene where War Machine and Iron Man enjoy some nachos a local eatery ( um , sure superhero billionaires do that all the time ) Robert Downey Jr . ? s annoying ? festish ? with distracting sunglasses and its Christmas ( for some reason not relevant to the plot whatsoever ) . The ? comedy ? is delivered either in the form of goofy slapstick , lame buddy sitcom crap with an inventor kid and non-funny banter which makes Tony less likeable by the minute . this paragraph makes it super duper clear that the reviewer has no reference for what the character of Iron Man / Tony Stark is . Distractions ? its a summer comic-book blockbuster . Nachos in a bar ? since when has Tony Stark been a normal 'superhere billionaire '' ? 'Less likeable ' ? Tony is not supposed to be all that great of a guy . hes a struggling recovering alcoholic who is trying to be better , but is nowhere near perfect . and the banter with the kid is so completely Tony Stark i dont even know what to say . not saying that iron man 3 was an A+ film , but it was never supposed to be the next Citizen Kane . this reviewer seems to expecting it to be something its not .

1 Which is why it is unreasonable to think they wo n't make all of those movies and milk everything they can to make money . Fox will be making X-Men movies for the next 50 years , just so the rights to the movie franchise wo n't revert back to Marvel . Same thing with Spiderman , same thing with Fantastic Four .

1 lolololol

1 I drive past the diner pretty often . I still have n't seen the movie though , so I think about that whenever I drive past .

1 No- there is no intermingling of districts . The government works hard to make sure that they stay completely separate so that they can not organize or compare living situations .

1 Late 80s when everyone was hoping that Marvel would figure this shit out , Comic Scene Magazine , I think , mentioned Eastwood as Wolverine and Tom Cruise as Spider-man . A young Tom Cruise would have made an awesome Spider-man .

1 Wrong kid ...

1 Sean Connery fucked all the other Bonds mothers and they went home .

1 He said no spoilers .

1 I was really disappointed that he could n't just rip off his arm like the epic . The original story is amazing and would 've made a great movie but they still have to fuck it up

1 Completely ignoring all the bullshit you spewed about Batman and Punisher , because you are entitled to your misinformed wrong opinion ... What does Dr. Manhattan have to do with anything here ? His superpower is the ability to manipulate matter , time , and space ... and the only reason he got these superpowers was because he stupid enough to wander into a time lock safe that was on a timer to shoot death rays at cinder blocks . Hardly in the same category as Iron Man , Batman , or Punisher .

1 Am I that man ?

1 Well , it 's supposed to be anyway . But , as they probably filmed the scene on a soundstage , they just used a cloth or plastic backdrop .

1 I 'll just leave this here ... . AT-ATs

1 2001 . Ghostbusters . Documentary : `` How to escape a cave ''

1 Do n't think about it . And see the movie .

1 `` Natalie Portman as a 12 uear old girl '' just makes me think of a fully grown Natalie Portman pretending to be 12

1 `` Boyhood is a gimmick , but Birdman is n't ... '' neither one of these films is a gimmick .

1 Only `` honorable mention '' to bikes from Akira ? Fuck off .

1 I was so pumped once * shoot to thrill * came on , he is one of the major reasons that I shelled out 15 $ to see it last night .

1 I liked Storm . They just never found anything interesting to do with her character in the movies though .

1 I hear so many great things about that film . Moving up on my priority watch list now .

1 Nope .

1 I used the e-mail link .

1 Yeah , the concept just seems so endless , you can do so much with it , it 's a shame they did so little .

1 Fashion .

1 people dont like that movie ?

1 Fanboyism is promoting your opinion as indisputable fact . That 's what you 're doing .

1 had to ctrl+f to make sure someone said hot rod . upvotes for you

1 Plus it has some great visual metaphors . Really , really special directing .

1 I was like ... Can it not see she 's wide awake , lucid and in pain ? But in the machine 's defence , she activated an emergency mode that may stop it requiring all preconditions for surgery .

1 I 'll be honest , I had no idea about how backward Chuck Norris actually is until I came to reddit . I always assumed he was a fairly right-wing movie star , and at the very most a strong proponent of the second amendment . However , I never took the time to delve any further than that until somewhere on reddit I came across a post where they were bagging on how terrible Chuck Norris was . I was confused until I actually looked him up on Google and saw how ridiculously self-centered and backward he is .

1 He did n't direct Jurassic Park III .

1 That was an amazing year for movies in any case , and you can tell that 1999 America was going through a lot of alienation . Why ? That same year : American Beauty , Fight Club , Office Space and Magnolia . All essentially different takes on the same idea of the emptiness of modern existence . I think if 9 / 11 had n't come along and scared us all shitless we were about to remake this country into something better . I think our films were giving us a preview .

1 If hipsters exclusively watch popular American movies from the last ten years , then yes .

1 It missed the mark cause although the acting , cinematography , and dialog all worked well , the plot and characters were pretty weak .

1 He must get Jason Segel in that , as well .

1 I read more about this a few days ago . From what I remember the store owner took the case to small claims court and she failed to appear which is what the warrant was actually for . The cops were quoted as saying something to the extent of ... they do n't judge the reason for the warrant , they just serve it . I 'm sure they had a big laugh about the absurdity of it . * ( ca n't remember the other source , sorry ) *

1 Gracias

1 No way dude , the history of Israel is shorter than this .

1 I was laughing so hard reading these . I agree completely .

1 Big trouble makes complete fucking sense !

1 `` If you have to ask , you ca n't afford it . ''

1 Yeah , derp , some stupid school thing that let you take a tour of the Capitol and governor 's office and got you a day off of school to give you some real life learning experience . How dare they do that to you .

1 I hope he got paid in delicious Cuban sandwiches !

1 * Fin . *

1 With some lube , yes .

1 John Blake says hi .

1 Punisher was good from what I remember , but I like my comic movies more like the previous ones . For DC , more like The Dark Knight . For Marvel , more like Iron Man and T.I.Hulk .

1 Maybe he 's a 40-50 year old dude .

1 So after reading your username its settled that I 'm gay for you . I do n't know how to feel about this either . Sorry .

1 Are you some kind of HIPPY ?

1 Obligatory * bring in the dancing lobstas *

1 I think Run-on-Sentence has it locked up .

1 Good news / u / djangolo . Marvel is producing an original Daredevil show for Netflix .

1 what a cunt

1 He said 16 .

1 Haha when I was a kid , I assumed the `` back room '' movies were just SUPER violent . I also thought there was a difference between X , XX , and XXX rated movies .

1 What ? No Will Smith as Neo ?

1 It 's called a ronto you filthy casual .

1 Hitchcock and Hermann

1 Agreed . I love Kevin Hart . Check out `` About Last Night . '' One of his best movies IMO .

1 So , another 'so another ' from WhatDidYouJustType ?

1 Yeah I 've seen it . I was n't at that one , but I was at Evening with Kevin Smith 2 : Evening Harder ... it was really fun , but not as fun as the Toronto one he did a year prior which was n't recorded : - /

1 They coined it . I might use it .

1 Iron Man 3 was the last movie on his original contract . His new contact has him tied to Avengers 2 and Avengers 3 .

1 i totally agree ... but im reallly drun , k so this image will give me nightmares thanks : /

1 To be honest I never really cared about Tommy Boy until I met my current gf who absolutely loves that movie . It has grown on me a lot .

1 So the prophecy says .

1 Societies were horrible . A lot still are . I 'd hate to think what sorts of fucked up shit went on in Africa before the white man . Slavery and all it entailed was abhorrent nonetheless .

1 Simply because of your name please accept all of my upvotes .

1 my dream or at least only thing i feel i will ever non hesitantly drop big money on , is a personal cinema . huge fancy screen and the best . surround sound i can buy . for movies and music !

1 I would say it 's debatable . I am by no means a movie critic or an expert or any other word like that . But it blows my mind how much praise that movie gets . It just felt * cynical * to me . I was never moved throughout the movie , and the only emotion I felt while watching it was confused , but it did n't feel like there was anything appealing about being confused . Hate that movie .

1 > with shows that aim at women . * starts to question own gender *

1 OHHHHHHHH !

1 I said watch clark ... and watch him good ... .you hear we ?

1 Toonces .

1 This is NZ . They really were some random dudes back yard . The various studios that we have border residential properties .

1 Well Star Wars was an homage to Flash Gordon and other twenties serials , so I 'm sure that 's what McQuarrie thought George wanted . Bet George loved this design , but it is a little over the top .

1 I could in the theatre .

1 Thanks : ) Trying to get better at explaining and teaching ( sometimes difficult ) concepts about art and drawing . So if you understood this and learned something , even if you 're not into drawing , then I take that as a big compliment !

1 Yeah , caring is stupid .

1 Well , Rocky had come equipped with a gun to shoot off the legs of his rival .

1 If I want to eat before the movie I will go somewhere that has better less expensive food , not at a greesy concession stand table . I need to sustain my hunger through out a three hour movie .

1 But his method is to ensure that the holocaust happens to the humans first .

1 Most of us anyway

1 Hunger is n't for everyone , though . It 's a very complicated and excruciating viewing experience . I own it and I could n't finish it the first time around .

1 The 'I have 2 episodes left ' bit kind of gave it away , there 's no reason for it to be there other than to bait , presumably he watched the other 8 episodes online without trouble so it does n't make sense that he 'd need help finding the last 2 episodes . If he said he had n't watched season 4 at all it would have been more believable .

1 Great cinema ! Also my local when very young , I sometimes make the extra effort to drive to Bath to see films now and again , so worth it .

1 Obligatory Dredd reference here . Also minimal plot . Two judges get trapped in a building full of criminals . Have to kill the boss . It 's basically a video game plot , and it works so well . Now that I mention it , it feels alot like Arkham Asylum . Huh .

1 Any Tyler Perry Movie .

1 No prob

1 I began to appreciate critics a little more when I ate at my first Michelin star carrying restaurant . It took eating to a whole new level . Places I thought were `` great '' became `` good . ''

1 `` Bitch get off me , STAR WARS ! ''

1 There are 7 series of Digimon . Series 2 is a sequel to 1 and series 7 is a sequel to 6 . There are a bunch of short movies relating to the series and one CGI style stand alone movie .

1 That 's Carrie Ann 's Theme from Jerry Goldsmith 's The Poltergeist . That score is widely considered to be one of Goldsmith 's best scores . Marc Strietenfield on the other hand did n't do too good a job following up . I recommend skipping it .

1 I agree . I think Seth and Evan can still do great writing together but they need to introduce some new actors . Appatow has been pretty absent lately too and I always liked his involvement .

1 [ Jim Cummings ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0191906 / ) has done a ton of voices in the animation industry . The man is basically a legend .

1 even that would sound beautiful in Gene Wilder 's voice .

1 I hate this website

1 It would be hard to give you only one reason . Noah Wyle is reason enough . The show , for me , is * EVERYTHING * I love about entertainment . It 's fun , it 's touching , it 's moving , it 's magical , it 's crazy , it 's entertaining , it 's visceral , and it 's intelligent . If I had my wish , i would make LIBRARIANS for the rest of my career .

1 That movie changed my life the first time I saw it when Ryan asks his wife , `` Tell me I have led a good life . '' `` Tell me I 'm a good man . ''

1 That was instance of `` how the fuck was she even ever encouraged to act '' more than a simple miscasting .

1 Hmmm , I didnt know this . Now I am concerned maybe

1 PIXAR IS A MERCIFUL AND BENEVOLENT GOD

1 Nope .

1 I nominate Kristen Schaal .

1 It 's not Zemeckis .

1 Every review I 've read has been stellar

1 You 're being downvoted because you just said the movie sucks without saying why you think it sucks . Of course everyone 's gon na downvote that one asshole who says something sucks for no reason .

1 There it is . Right where it should be .

1 That movie broke my little 13 year old heart . I think it was the first time I disliked a movie . I was young enough to love everything before then . That movie was a turning point in my life .

1 Seriously ? Alright . Welp you 'll have to revote in a second .

1 Agreed . That 's hilarious .

1 However , `` Street Fighter II , the animated movie '' = Perfect !

1 To prove that the mods are n't paid off .

1 Whoa dude ! so much nostalgia ! ! I adored that movie ! * Would you like a Hershey bar ? *

1 A model , * idiot . *

1 Not at all , but definitely watch them at some point if you like Fury Road .

1 Did n't the board game come out after the movie ? By `` based on a board game '' , I meant that the plot of the movie reflected that of a board game ; the same way the film `` The Shinning '' is based on Stephen King 's story , * The Shinning * . Not that the movie was about a board game .

1 when i originally did this i wanted to do a decades looks . Big was 5 or 6 years too early .

Surpised no Song of the South on there .

1 Based off the title , I 'd say inspiration might come from West World . The movies also tend to spread out the material of the first two books as well . This one will be centered on Dr. Wu 's idea to make dinosaurs genetically more advanced from the first book .

1 The 'leak ' barely mentioned Ant-Man and did n't mention Ross . 4chan also had a 'leak ' for Age of Ultron where it claimed the Avengers were going to defeat Ultron by uploading the personality of a little girl into him . Their leaks are notoriously unreliable .

You do n't have to be a god-like AI to have the ability to multitask , I can text and email friends when I have a conversation with my girlfriend , but I do n't . Just because you have the capacity to do something , does n't make it okay to do so . The polyamorous person dating a monogamous person is an excellent analogy for this . If the polyamorous person does n't tell their partner that they are or will be seeing others , that is absolutely a breach of trust . I do n't want to assume anything , but I 'm sure you and your partner communicated the boundaries of your relationship . Samantha never did this , and she * knows * Theodore thought them to be in an exclusive , monogamous relationship . She as an enormous intellect , its not like it just slipped her mind or she does n't comprehend Theodore 's concept of relationships . I absolutely consider it lying by omission . She knew it would hurt him , maybe even thought they would break up because of it , so she did n't tell him . It was selfish . As for your last few points , he was aware of the dynamic relationships the OSs could have . He knew they had friends outside of their purchasers , they dated people completely unrelated to their purchaser , etc . Samantha has read thousands of books , hundreds of thousands of publications , she knows the scope and expectations of human relationships , she knows who Theodore is . It 's kinda fucked up . Theodore agonizes over their relationship , tries to grow as an individual , tries to learn from his past mistakes in relationships and really give his all . Then he learns he is just one of hundreds , a drop in the bucket . He 's not her lover , he 's a pet .

1 He did n't say anything about the writing . He said movies with violence and sex are cheap and low-class . He 's dead wrong . There 's plenty of movies with sex and violence in them that are also fantastic movies . You 're not wrong about some movies using sex / violence to cover up bad writing , but I do n't think that 's what he was saying was the issue .

1 I agree . That moment of silence before they come out into a complete shit storm all from the bridge 's point of view was brilliantly done . It gives me hope for the new star wars J.J . is directing .

1 Agreed . I find Gosling a tad boring to watch .

1 I fucking love that movie , me and my ex went to see it 3 times in the theater , and lost it every time at [ this scene ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=8W3NERMKIBM )

1 Excellent movie , did n't know it was n't well received in this subreddit .

1 Yeah , trailers are great . It 's the car , chewing gum , cell phone , drink , etc commercials which annoy me .

1 Start at the beginning . It 's the best place . Blood Simple is a masterpiece .

1 As a Japanese speaker , I can tell you this : 1 ) it 's pronounced ji-bu-ri in Japan 2 ) the original word , so far as I know , is pronounced 'Gibly ' 3 ) it 's not a Japanese word so it 's up to you how you say it , really

1 So much this . Reading the author bitch about Batman and Man of Steel I got the feeling that he felt Camp-batman from the 60 's TV show with Adam West was the only * real * batman or something , and that Superman was Christopher Reeve or bust . I mean , these movies are really the first time either of these characters have truly been taken seriously in Cinema , and people are pissed that these adaptions are `` too gritty '' ? Lets face facts : The costumes of old do n't make any fucking sense . Spandex and wearing your underpants over your pants is just fucking lame . Batman ? He 's * always * been a big angry bloke in kevlar ( with the exception of Adam West-Camp batman . However , if anything , THAT was the un-faithful adaption because it takes exactly * zero * of bruce wane 's likely psychology into account in favor of kid friendliness to the point of relying on deus ex machina every other episode or so . ... I watched the whole show on re-runs and VHS when I was a kid . It 's fucking * terrible * ) . At least , he has been for as long as there has been kevlar . It does n't make any sense for him to NOT wear body armor , and calling him a riot policeman rather than a superhero is little more than the author trying to hipster his way past everything that the Nolan trilogy * is * without addressing what parts he does n't actually like . Basically , the fucker is nit-picking details , and trying to use them to justify calling the whole movie-making process behind some of the most successful movies in history shit . Fuck you Bobby MacPherson . You suck , and you 're wrong . There . I put the exact same effort into justifying my points about the author as he did justifying his points against Batman and Man of Steel . That said , he 's probably right about the Lone Ranger . However , unlike batman and MoS the Lone Ranger is flopping pretty hard . Still a fucking * horrible * comparison though .

1 I plan on getting a Masters in Robotics ( already have one BS and working on a second BS ) . That movie pandered to my every childhood fantasy about what I wish life was like , and what I want to be doing . It made me so happy for the couple of days after I saw it .

1 Theres one for Brave too , where it says `` Not related to . '' So many kids must be getting pissed with their parents after the hype .

1 One is an animated , child orientated musical , the other is not . The film does n't `` need '' to contribute anything to the story of moses , it just has to be a good film .

1 The first scene of Requiem for 90 minutes .

1 How To Train Your Dragon 2 . Dad stuff gets me .

1 Yeah ! I felt that too , and now thinking back to the movie . There was one scene where Cage walks in with a shotgun , and a Mimic blindsides him , but he knew exactly where to shoot it as it comes up to him . No way that an unsuspecting Cage would survive that .

1 He honestly was n't bad in it . I would have preferred his character be what Kellan Lutz 's was in 3 . He 's not a bad actor and honestly he was a good way to breathe life into the second film and they killed him . Did n't make sense .

1 Wreck-it Ralph was the film before Frozen . That 's how far back you have to go for a male lead in a Disney movie .

1 Yeah , I watched it for the first time not long after coming out to my friends and family and I totally cried for like the last 45 minutes . Good film .

1 I second Escape From New York . So enjoyable .

1 Yep . A shame he did n't catch on so much . After Terminator and Aliens he was surely set to be a classic action hero , but somehow it did n't really happen . Maybe his looks are too conventional ?

1 its great first time i saw it i was freaked out , 2nd time it was amazing . this is going to be a cult classic .

1 No Country for Old Men was crafted as a screenplay first ...

1 The hobo fisherman footage was probably used because 1 . It gives some back story to him becoming Superman , and 2. it probably featured minimal CGI whereas actual scenes with him as Superman wo n't be finished yet

1 Ca n't say for sure , but this does n't seem like a fair portrayal

1 The academy were duped by the title poor naive bastards .

1 Their references were all over the place !

1 The fighting between Ryan Reynolds and the little brother is just awesome .

1 Second time watching I realized she was lying about him being 10 to throw Old Joe off of his trail . Mathematically he 'd be 5-7 in the film .

1 It is happening . Bay is just producing and not directing . I do n't believe they are still aliens .

1 The show is 'Bojack Horseman ' . It 's really good . A great mix of comedy and drama . It 's a Netflix original , and is still on there . I have tried to get pretty much everyone I know to watch it .

1 The twist will remain , but the ending is changed .

1 The 2005 version is an over-the-top parody of the 1936 version . The original was intended as serious anti-drug propaganda , but fails badly due to how ridiculous it is ; the parody is almost a remake , just bringing the absurdity even higher to make the satire more blatant . Personally I like the 2005 one better because it 's a little less boring to watch ( and the last line is hilarious ) .

1 Here is an answer by Graig Good of Pixar for why [ Andy does n't have a dad ] ( http : / www.quora.com / Toy-Story-movie-series / Why-is-Andys-father-never-mentioned-in-any-of-the-Toy-Story-films ) : `` I 'm often highly entertained by the deep analyses and psychological guesswork about this . The real answer is that we could n't afford a dad . Human characters were just hideously expensive and difficult to do in those days and , as Lee mentioned , Andy 's dad was n't necessary for the story . Sid 's dad was a solid arm and leg , meant to be seen from that one angle , and his mom was just an off-screen voice . Same reason . ''

1 Are you kidding ? You 're kidding right ?

1 The village , there i said it ... .M.Night sucks now , but in his hey day ... he was on to something ... the way he kept the old time feel of the film is very impressive , somewhat reminiscent to the way kubrick did Barry Lyndon after tackling other genres . The knife shot after Phoenix gets stabbed , was very well done . It kinda reminds me of LOST , The end / twist wass meh ... but the ride was fun .

1 yes !

1 That 's great ! I 've actually thoroughly enjoyed Craig as James Bond .

1 yeah , in the movie they do n't give you any background to what kind of publication rorschach sends his journal to ( for all we know it 's a reputable national newspaper ) , which leaves it way more open to the idea that there might be justice served than the comic allows .

1 You 'll be in the vast minority , though , and it likely wo n't have any noticeable effect on his career .

1 Plus there are literally thousands of existing dinosaurs they could have chosen from . Heck if they just stuck with that underwater one it would have been new enough for the film to feel fresh .

Aside from that I thought the battle scenes and the special effects were pretty entertaining .

1 I do n't think any of what you said is particularly tied to patriotism so much as it 's tied to Hollywood 's ( well cinema in general but Hollywood is the most responsible ) vision of war and war films .

Can the Avengers be the Avengers without Iron Man or Thor ? , yeah , but are people gon na make it a billion dollar movie without those big faces ? , unlikely .

1 What a twist !

1 i 'd watch a biopic on the shamwow guy . from hawking shitty rags to beating up hookers to directing hollywood features , there 's got ta be some good shit in there .

1 Not exactly , Transhumanists are supportive of utilising technology to maximize and enhance humanity / human potential . It is n't racial superiority or any crap like that it is using technology to its fullest potential to make humanity collectively faster / stronger / smarter , and eliminate genetic diseases / 'deficiencies ' .

1 The dog from Sandlot scared me more as a child than any other movie monster .

1 I was almost never born because of this movie . My dad was a big fan of the original , so he asked out my mom to go watch it on one of their first dates . He hyped up the movie so much that the date went sour thanks to this horrible film ...

1 Get a babysitter . Or a friend to just watch a movie at your house while you go to the later showing .

1 Ask your mom . Hiyoooo !

1 The lines before that one makes it * way * better : Mark : How was work today ? Johnny : Oh , pretty good . We got a new client and the bank will make a lot of money . Mark : What client ? Johnny : I can not tell you ; it 's confidential . Mark : Aw , come on . Why not ? Johnny : No , I ca n't . Anyway , how is your sex life ?

1 What does that even mean ?

1 Aw man , you just gave me a flash of how great that movie could have been with Edward Norton playing Langdon . Such a shame .

1 but only if they are in no way intimidating whatsoever - children and women only .

1 Dude .

1 No more like * Rocky * anyway .

1 I really enjoyed that character , but he 's far closer to the wrong side of this discussion . The homosexual elements of his character were basically only there to highlight how `` eccentric '' he was .

1 ya hes responsible for 2 abominations rather than just 1

1 I 'm considering whether or not to downvote you ... Oh well , too late .

1 Not a very reliable source

1 I actually really liked that more realistic confrontation at the end . Besides , it gave an occasion for some grade-A Samuel L. Jackson monologuing , which is always a plus in my book .

1 Or Demolition too . Out of those three , I think he 's a shoe-in for a nomination this year .

1 Taken 2 was an unnecessary film .

1 Is there a source for Kurt and Courtney 's relationship as 'beating the shit out of each other ' ? Because I do n't think Kurt was a wife beater . Or was that just a figure of speech ?

1 Old wood and hay are highly combustible . * HIGHLY * combustible . * HIGHLY ... COMBUSTIBLE . *

1 I really like Nolan . I really do but I think he 's a tad overrated . I 'll watch anything he puts out and enjoy it but I do n't think he 's done anything that deserves an oscar . That being said , he does deserve a nomination or two .

1 kevin smith movies

1 * cough * Emma Watson * cough *

1 A wizard did it .

1 Raise The Red Lantern -- A very interesting look at warlord era aristocracy .

1 That 's just , like , your opinion , man

1 Do n't forget the awesome car chase in Death Proof .

1 They are overdue for some decent music too .

1 And the thing is , all she was saying is that memories stay . The same argument could be made that hate transcends time , or indifference , or boredom . The idea of the monologue is okay , but the fact that she was saying ONLY love transcends time is stupid .

1 You 're missing the point . The movie romanticized the story . It made him look more prepared and his experience more beautiful than reality . He rejected aid when somebody offered to better equip him for his Alaskan misadventure and instead decided he could tackle the challenge of an Alaskan winter with a bag of rice , a book on local edible plants and gun . He said , fuck it , gave away his parents money that they reserved for him to improve his life , rejected the aid of others , and ignored every ounce of natural common sense and doomed himself because of stupidity . He did n't respect nature and it ended him . I have to say I 'm surprised he lasted as long as he did .

1 Yes ! I ? m so excited for this ! Also , Finding Dory . I ? ve been waiting forever for this movie it seems .

1 Using dragonflies for surveillance wo n't be far behind .

1 I would say the first stepfather was definitely emotionally abusive of Mason .

1 Here 's the trailer ! * . *

1 > There were a lot of random boob shots in Age Of Ultron and hers were especially visible during the town destruction . Those were her superpowers .

1 Watch his performance in * Margot at the Wedding * , and you 'll be surprised at how good he can be when he works at it . I do n't even like him that much , but he did a fantastic job in that movie .

1 I did n't think it was too scary . I was just like `` whhaaattt , what , what ''

1 he was a wrestler in the other two ...

1 Not really since Cameron just produced Sanctum and Whedon actually wrote this movie .

1 I do n't believe all 3 Hobbit movies are the plot of the Hobbit . From what I read about the interviews , the first 2 movies are the Hobbit , and the third movie is a bridge between the Hobbit and the LOtR series . Movie 3 is supposed to be comprised of parts from The Unfinished Tales and some stories about what Gandalf is doing when he disappears during the Hobbit . But , I agree Hollywood 's math is wonky . I 'm reading the Hobbit now for the first time , and I have no idea how he got two 3-hour movies from this book .

1 The wrong son died !

1 Sorry , Mr. Cameron .

1 The roar of a T-rex over your home system will never come close to what you feel in a theater .

1 Came here to say this . Have n't sweated so much in my life .

1 Are you new to /r/movies ? That 's all they seem to care about here . That and pictures of Ben affleck and Jared leto

1 Why would you lie about it ? !

1 I took my girlfriend to it and she dumped me a couple days later .

1 I can . The characters were entirely one dimensional . Watch a few minutes of each character in action , and you can then predict his / her / its behavior for the rest of the movie .

1 It was also the first episode of the Freddy 's Nightmares .

1 Well it does seem to be a dream sequence ...

1 Funny . This is based on a book based on said current events .

1 Well while that is good . I put it a tier below those movies . I added Glory and Remember the Titans though . These are just my opinions

1 456456 is the only correct answer .

1 I 'm a real person , you should watch the film , it is very good . Though I would avoid seeing it if you 're in a jolly mood .

1 The Fuck is wrong with you

1 Actually a 42 minute difference , Wolf is three hours .

1 Sourcefed nerd has a really good review on it .

1 I ca n't begin to explain how incredible that film is .

1 i never understood half the movie but i still enjoyed it .

1 Say hi to your mother for me

1 If they want to embrace how inherently ridiculous of an idea this is .

1 Just be thankful he does n't wear a jong .

1 It 's not like every Imperial just threw up their arms and said `` welp , no reason to fight now '' when they heard their leaders were dead .

1 Why would Man of Steel 2 be a Batman / Superman film ? It 's a standalone project .

1 Thank you . I could n't even begin to explain how much that stupid article missed and was wrong about .

1 I love watching his movie with bitches cuz I always cry and they think I 'm sensitive or whatever . I 'm like girl im crying for Nicole Kidman , not you ... .. However on a serious note , I 'm a straight male and used to watch this daily for a couple months in high school . Cried every time .

1 Do you like Batman ? You like Zorro .

1 Trick 'r Treat , it has the anthology feel of Creepshow but integrates them into a cohesive story portrayed in a non-linear timeline . A lot like how Tarantino presented Pulp Fiction .

1 Well at least to me a lot of the CGI in DoS looked unfinished . Much of it just looked rushed , except for Smaug . Like the melted gold scene or most of the Orcs in general .

1 Ah , come on now . Let 's have a nice cuppa tea and settle down .

1 Holy shit . Daniel Day-Lewis as Atticus Finch would be amazing .

1 Ryan Newman has been busy

1 I moved it the wrong way dick

1 Guys like you are giving me more hope for this . I 'm putting the tissue box away now .

1 Why would Donald play Peter Parker ? Get real

1 My favorite part was when the dead people were walking . I never saw it coming .

1 If your gon na dream . Dream big ! This would be a badass poster !

1 I 'm with you on death proof .

1 Based on what we know of the ( pre-Disney ) EU , it appears the Star Wars universe hit the technological singularity some 5000+ years ago . The ships and tech in Star Wars : The Old Republic are just as high-tech , if not more so , than the ships found during the Galactic Civil War .

1 I believe he used the word 'bisexual '

1 `` I 'll be back ''

1 It 's funny cause it sounds foreign and not white , therefore these idiots ca n't get it right ! / s

1 The scene with Dante and Randal in jail in Clerks II

1 My best guess is Flightplan . It 's clearly a large plane with a staircase and someone in the doorway , but I can not tell what the background is , or if that 's more to do with the film than the actual image .

1 David Duchovny was brilliant in it .

1 Something about dinosaurs or some shit .

1 I was n't sure whether to laugh because the scene could have potentially be the beginning of something bad , but I still could n't resist just bursting out laughing once he fell . That whole sequence was amazing .

1 Agreed . * Walberg played Max with too much humor . * The Valkyrie symbol makes no sense when the drug is drunk instead of injected * Ludacris as Chief Bravora * Max finds Valkyrie to be a good thing instead of hating it for killing his family * There are no real characters from the game but they are refered to in the film which just cheapens them even more . * Mona is just some chick and played by the too young Kunis * The voice over is rare and uninspired * It 's not a fun neo-film noir like the game was * The literal use of Valkyries could have been interesting but it ended up being distracting * Why did they have to change the storyline with the awesome conspiracy and instead make it a partner betrayal ? * Do n't try to make your film bigger than it is and try to set up for a sequel no one wants by putting scenes after the credits * No weird dream sequence . * No one talked about `` eating the flesh of fallen angels * * heavy sigh *

1 I will always resent the Basketball Diaries for absolutely butchering the source material and turning it into one 90 minute long mid 90s 'This is your brain on heroin ' ad .

1 fucking loved it , great to see Keanu back where he belongs

1 Definitely hit or miss , kind of like Portlandia . But when they 're good , they 're REALLY good .

1 I think he 's constantly in the middle of a bankruptcy so if he spends it at then the government ca n't take it .

1 The article says > Unfortunately , there isn ? t much we can do . That ? s the difficult position we ? re in . Then there is a online petition you can sign that no one important will look at .

1 > When has Jesse Eisenberg ever proven to be a vicious sociopath ? First off , OP did n't say `` vicious '' . But have you seen The Social Network ? He 's borderline sociopathic ( not straight up , but close ) . And he can do cocky , charismatic a-hole , just watch The Double . Jesse Eisenberg has serious chops , and he 's shown in multiple roles that he can pull off what 's required for Luthor .

1 Nah , we just let you think that so you 'd jump out of the van and we could continue with the plan .

1 This is an example of the kind of attention to detail Abrams also put into the new Trek . There will be tons of little details like this that they pay attention to .

1 The Room is bad enough to be remarkable . 50 Shades looks bad enough to be boring .

1 This is the way I 've felt about every 3D film I 've seen yet . I saw UP , for example , in 3D , and enjoyed it soooo much more in 2D .

1 Chill OP , I like your posts . I enjoy film but have never studied it , the depth of a frame is n't something I 've consciously considered this way before so thanks for opening my eyes to it .

1 Spoilers ahead . The raptors go rouge and kill people . I ca n't see how anyone would believe that 's bring trained . Maybe they 're smart enough not to bite the hand that feeds them , which would be Pratt .

1 The ant scene was the best one in the movie . You can hear the traditional sound effects of a fist fight ( someone breaking melons with a bat ) when Indy punches the Russian Big Guy . The CGI might not have been the best , but that scene was the Indy-est scene in the whole movie . It should be compared to the fist fight at the airport or Indy hanging on a tank .

1 I enjoyed the Transformers films for what they were , but being a somewhat not-obsessed old-school fan of the old TV series , they could have been a whole lot better . The robot designs were sloppy . Shia Lebeouf is just too damn annoying . Megan Fox was there pretty much to be the hot girl and that 's it . Totally unnecessary . There were way too many toilet-humor jokes , especially in 2 and 3 . Sure , some of the action was decent , but it had way too much shaky-cam bullshit going on . I think the biggest flaw about all three is that they have no real heart to them . Like someone else mentioned , they seem aimed to the lowest common denominator of audiences . Sure , they made a fuck-ton of money , but overall they just were n't * good * . Pacific Rim is a movie about giant robots pummeling on giant monsters and , while I have n't seen it , looks to be a serious film with some integrity and heart to it . Michael Bay was all wrong for the TF franchise , and now he 's helping to make the TMNT movie , and I 'm worried for it too . I 'll hold judgement until it 's out , but I 'm not getting my hopes up .

1 Fair enough . But technically the 3D source was bigger . Here are the two source links : [ 2D ] ( http : / images5.fanpop.com / image / photos / 24700000 / Nemo-Poster-finding-nemo-24749523-364-491.jpg ) & [ 3D ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / media / rm3974539776 / tt0266543 ) I think they added some bloom to the 3D version or something ...

1 To be fair ( and I love that movie ) that 's the entire movie , except they leave the hotel sometimes .

1 He looks like Tobey McGuire in old age makeup and a fat suit .

1 I do n't think it was originally going to be an actual film . I 've looked into it a few times and it seems it was originally just a little film project for the trailer . The interest got people talking about making an actual movie , but I had n't heard that progress had been made .

1 It 's a joke . edit : [ The trailer for Driving Miss Daisy ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=BR0oZ2pnhyg ) . She 's a cranky old woman . The joke is that putting up with her is worse than being in prison .

1 I think it does . I mean , knowing what a director does ( and how their decisions affect the final product ) is that much more in depth if you 're a director yourself .

1 I turned it off .

1 It was also quite relaxing .

1 Thanks for getting where I 'm coming from . I get why you responded the way you did . Like I said in another comment I think it sucks that people do n't take Shia seriously just because he 's willing to show that he does stupid things ( like plagarize ) like the rest of us . He 's a good actor and I look forward to seeing more of his work .

1 I fucking loved the overly ornate space craft and all the giant marble halls they lived in . Why have such impractical things ?

Of * course * they have gold statues stuck on the outside of their space craft .

1 Requiem for a Dream ... great movie , but hard to watch at times .

1 Why ?

1 My sources are that I have been there . All around the model they have little video stands explaining it . Even some of the grounds in the snow . For some close up shots then they will use life size models , such as harry hanging onto the towers .

1 It says `` review copy '' in the title .

1 This is pretty typical AV Club . They can be funny and clever sometimes , but they pander to * anything * that can possibly be seen as racially / gender motivated . I would n't put much stock in anything they say ( unless you also hear it from more reputable sources ) . They 're basically a bunch of suburban born hipsters who never grew out of the college phase of dictating the world 's problems and injustices to those who clearly are n't as knowledgeable .

1 I saw it on friday in `` DBOX seats '' ( motion seats like the honey i shrunk the audience attraction at disney world ) . First off i have not seen the first one , nor was i really interested in seeing this one , but i had a good reason to be there anyway . that being said , the acting was n't really that great ( sly can barely talk ) , the plot was minimal at best , and the DBOX motions felt really `` tacked on '' . that being said , this movie was great , for what it is . it had all the explosions and deaths needed for a great `` mindless '' movie . something you can just sit down and enjoy on a really superficial level . i wish the opening scene had just carried on for another hour and a half . no need for all that plot and whatnot . Can anyone come up with a kill count for this movie ? i would be interested to see that

1 Brad Bird is an underrated director . He 's directed so many movies that make you feel good , but also make excelent points

1 Siskel is out of his element

1 He drove the plot that made the jkkes make sense , but he had little to do with most of the funny parts .

1 I suppose you could say I took the Quentin Tarantino approach : `` I did n't study movies , I watched movies . '' I actually have also studied film ( not in film studies , I have a degree in English and focused on film ) but there 's a lot to be said by learning movies by just watching as many as you can .

1 This was my first thought . I love con men movies and Cage is actually used well here .

1 * The Dark Knight * had a CRAZY one . From cellphones in cakes , to free bowling balls , the list goes on .

1 It 's that final fight with Vader that gets me every time . The part where Vader taunts Luke about turning his sister to the dark side and he just flips out . There 's so much anger and so little control in his fighting but he still manages to defeat Vader which proves Palpatine 's point about the Dark side . Then he still refuses to join after he looks at his and Vader 's hands ( Vader 's has been chopped off as had Luke 's in the previous movie ) and realises how much like Vader he became in that small outburst of anger . Then in the prequels they just sort of fight because they got to the boss arena . You could maybe say Obi v Ani in RotS works emotionally but it goes on for way to long for me to care .

1 I continue to be amazed at the ignorance about sexual equality around here every time I look over the comments on a post like this . There are two types of people . One of them was naturally larger than the other , so when the two types of people developed socially , it was along the guidelines set down by the ones with the bigger sticks . Everything about the way women have developed socially throughout the entire history of our race has been overseen by men to some extent . To point out things like `` women wear revealing clothes because they 're hotter '' , or `` fewer women get formal education in this field '' Is to show a deep seeded ignorance that you are unlikely to rise above as long as you test your ideas in places like this .

1 That was awesome . TRW does n't need a trailer like this , but fuck it , how amazing was that ? ?

1 What else could he mean ?

1 This movie has such good angles of human nature . The colors are in the right places .

1 If only the film itself could travel by map .

1 Just seems that it only works if you * start * from an assumption that the health service is `` for-profit '' , can charge whatever they want , with total disregard for the person , and use whatever contractual clauses they want , with the 'patient ' unable to discuss or negotiate . And everything is always on the company 's terms , and everyone just accepts that its the only way it can work , and that its right . Just does n't work in relation to any other civilised country in the world * except * the USA .

1 At least they put humor in this !

1 delightfully horrifying performance from Tom Hardy

1 I do n't see why they needed to re-boot the series . The clay-mation was all I ever needed .

1 Saving Mr.Banks for best film was odd as well .

1 Fucking Paddington mate

1 Took years off his perceived age , I think .

1 We get it , Die Hard takes place at a Christmas party . We 've known it for 25 years .

1 That statement frightens me for some reason ...

1 Strange , I 'm the opposite . I thought it was really boring as a kid , but saw it again by chance and fell in love with it .

1 The need make a movie about first few episodes , where they go to find the cats . Mostly because every episode after that was basically the same format , big monster shows up > they lose > form voltron > they win

1 Haha , movies is a weird place is n't it .

1 I ... DRINK ... YOUR ... FORTY ! * sluuuuuurp * I DRINK IT UP

1 oh my god , I 've watched that movie so many times and never noticed that . thanks !

1 One of my favorite thrillers .

1 This is not to be confused with the 2006 film with the same name by Neil Burger . This one is French .

1 Livable surface area .

1 Why do people keep saying that ? I admit , the mid-section took some effort , but I think it was book-ended by some impressive storytelling that I imagine a lot of people could relate to .

1 There could be entire semesters dedicated to just the exchanged looks between JK Simmons and Miles Teller at the very end of the movie : approval , desperation , fear , relief , to name a few . That tiny scene perfectly sums up the movie without uttering a single word . Powerful , beautiful and frightening all at the same time .

1 One of the first times I heard sobbing in a theater

1 Exactly , I remember seeing a quote somewhere that really made me think . `` Suicide does n't take away the pain , it just gives it to someone else . ''

1 I do n't know how old she is but she looks twelve .

1 > We should be joining in his cynicism if Hollywood movies are ever to use even a modicum of creativity . You realize that we 're discussing a movie for kids , right ? Kids ' films are how children learn those tropes before getting sick of them . To the kids who watched it , this film was probably incredibly original . If you want originality , watch Sundance Film Festival entries , not big budget kids ' flicks . If you wanted to see a cliche-free film , * you * bought the wrong ticket .

1 Triangle .

1 Have n't seen it for years but just watched the clip there and the way Statham sizes him up with such contempt- `` I 'm the big dog '' he 's thinking- and says `` Enjoy LA '' is hilarious .

1 Read rule number one on the sidebar .

1 > ... which the British have not admitted for 40-some years . 1 ) The Polish cracked the ( far simpler ) 3-rotor enigma code , and that was the work they passed on to the British . The British went on to crack the 4-rotor German Navy Enigma , a completely different level of difficulty . 2 ) 40-some years ? WW2 happened a bit earlier than the 70 's . Also , it 's common knowledge , not something they would need to admit to .

1 Seriously , I could read these posts for ages . It helps that this is one of my all-time favorite movies . : )

1 How can you forget his greatest work ? Up .

1 It 's that that malibu

1 Iron Sky

1 A great , fun , smart indie film . The Brothers Bloom and Looper were also good , but it seems like the Hollywood money compromised Rian Johnson 's style a bit . His episodes of Breaking Bad were amazing , though .

1 I think that point is that it really does n't matter if he 's crazy and killed all of those people or if he 's crazy and it 's just all in his head . No one cares either way so whether he did it or merely imagined it changes nothing . Bateman even freely admits at the end that his recounting of the story is meaningless .

1 `` 60 's the new 30 motherfucker ! '' had me rolling .

1 Exactly . What matters is I believe them in the moment .

1 He had one for 2001 in special effects

1 [ Pulp Fiction ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0110912 ) ( 1994 ) , Quentin Tarantino

1 I loved elephant guy ! My favorite part of the movie .

1 The last episode is a killer ! So annoyed they did n't do another season to expand on that ...

1 Straight into `` Farewell '' by Bob Dylan . Perfect .

1 He was one of my favorite actors , you should check out `` You Ca n't Take It with You . '' I 'd also be remiss if I failed to mention `` Harvey '' , `` Mr. Smith Goes to Washington '' and `` It 's a Wonderful Life . '' Basically , if you see Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart , you can not go wrong .

1 Yes ! She 'd be trying to have a nice normal life to blend in and not be involved in the types of crazy things her family gets into anymore . Oh , and maybe * he 's * the one that gets kidnapped and Violet saves him . Pixar / Disney would love to reverse the `` damsel in distress '' story I 'm sure ( like was done pretty well with the first Incredibles when they were rescuing Dad ) .

1 > Nolan 's opinion is very much respected in the community and shared by many While there are a few directors like Nolan and Tarantino that are major fans of traditional film , there are many more like James Cameron , Guillermo del Toro , and Peter Jackson who are instead pushing for digital film at higher resolutions and higher frame rates .

1 ... foooooolish ...

1 You got it .

1 [ Thank Dario Marianelli for that one ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=BjgTFd6XAg8 ) .

1 I would 've rather had Godzilla die twenty minutes in if it meant Bryan Cranston would still be on screen .

1 `` I am a golden god ''

1 Coo coo ca chaw !

1 You realize animation still has visual storytelling , lighting and composition involved right ?

1 You mean , nostalgically starts touching self inappropriately , yeah ?

1 Hah , I 'm clinically depressed and on my way to recovery . This movie brought back some depression . Thanks for your concern about mental illness though , it 's good to see .

1 Also , MLP is not the charmer I would have pegged her to be either .

1 `` Okay guys , we need a poster for this film Noah . Ideas ? '' `` Well , I mean , we obviously have to have his back to the camera , facing some big disaster , I mean thats a given '' `` Of course , of course , obviously , what else ? '' `` Well , he should have a gun in his hand , obviously . '' `` Wait , this takes place before guns ... '' `` Hmm ... .we could- no ... .uh ... .we ca n't just give him a gun ? '' `` No . How about an older weapon ? '' `` A spear ? '' `` Yeah whatever . So water , actors back , heavily shopped , maybe a lens flare if we can find the room , and give him a weapon . To fight the water with . '' `` Jeez , still not enough action . Tell you what . Scrap the lens flare , and add some lightning instead . I wish we could have both , but hey we 're trying to be creative here . ''

1 yep this list lost it 's credibility for me when they put Godfather 2 and Goodfellas ahead of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull

1 What the hell is the pommel horse just doing in the middle of the village ! Why would the bad guys fight near that thing , this guy clearly knows gymkata !

1 It might be that Von Trier wanted it consumed in a single sitting , instead of in five different ones . Secondly , if he wanted to be accessible I doubt he would have made a five-hour sex epic .

1 Casino is great , really really fuckin great , but Goodfellas had better pace and I do n't THINK was quite as long . Casino kinds of drags out in the third quarter of the movie , but comes together at the end . Classic for sure .

1 The two of them together was a brilliant decision though .

1 He died about 5 years ago . So , he 's ripe for a comeback .

1 The Hobbits Take Manhattan !

1 The long shot at the end of Children of Men .

1 Had to scroll through a lot of comments before I found one I empathize with .

1 If we 're going with Scorsese , might as well throw in Wolf Of Wall Street . It 's not technically a gangster movie , but you could argue that Belfort is a gangster of sorts .

1 I agree , I love Thunderdome and consider it superior to Mad Max . Very different movie from Road Warrior , but not in a bad way .

1 He does n't know jazz drumming then .

1 Same here . When I heard that they were making a movie about giant mechs battling giant monsters , I never thought that the movie would actually end up being made . Watching it on the big screen just seemed surreal . I think I watched the trailers several dozens of times , I just could n't believe it . I ca n't wait for a prequel / sequel to it . I want to see more Pacific Rim .

1 Oh yes ! Would you like a sausage in the mouth ?

1 Seconded . Not many people saw it , but it was beautifully shot and it 's a damn shame that there may not be a sequel based on box office performance . It 's much better than Stallone 's attempt , and you do n't even have to be a fan of the comic to enjoy it . After I saw it , I tweeted something alone the lines of `` It 'd be a crime if it 's not nominated for a cinematography Oscar . '' I stand by that .

1 $ 400,000 and they could n't even afford a decent bridge .

1 Thank you very much : )

1 Wow , I did n't know they just [ flat out showed ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / jFMw61m.jpg ) what the Sentinels for the movie look like . I was kind of excited to just get a glimpse during a later trailer or something , and be even more excited to see the movie .

1 That was a good episode of QI .

1 Please do n't see half of stalker on a badly encoded youtube video . Stalker may very well be the best movie ever , so give it a bit of respect : - )

1 `` So * that 's * why they called it that . ''

1 * Giggles and Paley * . Still a better love story than 50 Shades of Twilight

1 I would have assumed my distinct writing style would have given it away .

1 points for effort .

1 I 'm only pointing out that it exists in the film . Example : Ultron directly references the story of Noah in the script . I neither propagated nor encouraged religion on anyone , I was merely pointing out it 's existence as a thematic element in this film . [ Deal with it ] ( / http : / i.imgur.com / 54CB338.jpg ) , it 's a big part of culture whether you agree with it or not . You should be able to handle references to things you disagree with without becoming angry . [ LOL @ `` shoving religion in here '' ] ( / http : / i.imgur.com / siGsfYU.gif )

1 Whoops ! Totally missed the Alien image for the album - good call on actually looking through his site !

1 Because the ratings are calculated together with opinions by many different critics . Not all people like the same stuff as much as you . There is n't anything reliable , only opinions .

1 No that 's just her face .

1 After watching the movie , I was on my way home thinking about the entire trilogy and the way it ended when I looked up and saw a bat fly across a streetlight . I was happy and sad at the same time .

1 It is , but some parents are lazy and do n't read . As I 've said on here already about parents bringing their kids to see Ted because it was a movie about a talking teddy bear .

1 Actually , yes ! He 's currently in the middle of recovering from an extreme weight loss regimen he had to undergo for the film . Tom Hanks plays The wire . Some insiders have said it 's Hank 's best performance since Castaway , going so far as to call him , 'a revelation ' .

1 Meh not that crazy , just eats their placentas . Nothing freaky or anything .

1 For those who do n't know - The mismatched name thing happens b / c actors have which billing ( 1st / 2nd / 3rd ) written into their contract , but when graphic designers do the posters , these often do n't line up with what looks best or even who the main character is , so mismatch happens . Inevitable and not a big deal .

1 Including the extremely jarring , tacky and out of place use of Somewhere Over the Rainbow as some sort of uplifting theme song ... I do n't even know what they were thinking .

1 Definitely agree ! It would be completely realistic for the survivors to just be running away from something and not know what it is . Personally , I think it would add to the fear and mystery . I read that the producers spent months trying to figure out an original look for the monster too , which kind of sucks when it would have been more powerful never showing it .

1 I 'm not sure if English is your first language but it makes complete sense .

1 Makes me wonder if any of these actors felt about this film the way Dave Chappelle claimed to feel about fried chicken . `` I 'm just waiting for chicken to approach me to do a commercial . Nigga , I 'll do it for free ! ''

1 It 's from a guy who did a review of the star wars prequals . Link if you 're interested : https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=FxKtZmQgxrI

1 This . And Once Upon a Time in West also is a good one if you can find it on Netflix I had a Spaghetti Western phase lately and watched as many as I could that apparently had interesting plots , Leone or not , Eastwood or not . Many are similar , many did n't age well , some are silly , but over all it 's a very interesting experience and you sometimes find little piece of treasures among the mass of movies . That is , of course , if you have time ( I had some back when I had that simili-depression thing where I would n't leave the house at all except for 4 classes a week and doing my groceries ) . I still have the list of those I saw , somewhere on my computer I thing

1 Is he funny , or something ?

1 He 's the Trix rabbit in space .

1 > As far as Disney taking over goes , Hamill seems to be taking the same cautiously optimistic approach as the rest of us , telling the magazine , ? I have mixed feelings about that , but they have n't done badly by Marvel and the Muppets and Pixar . It 's one of those big decisions that at first seems unusual , but then the more you look at it , the more it makes sense . '' I think he makes a pretty good point here . Disney is not EA or something , cannibalizing and destroying good products for short-term profit . They have a history of letting successful IPs continue to do their thing .

1 Obediah 's men kinda `` finished up '' the whole camp after he walked out of the tent with Faran .

1 Him calling out the whore girlfriend was pretty funny though .

1 \ # TeamChewie Fix 'd

1 I think you answered your own question .

1 Not After Earth .

1 Breakfast at Tiffany 's

1 I wish there could be some kind of protocol for threads like these . Maybe put the name of the movie first , then spoiler tag the death ( or whatever the spoiler may be if the question is different ) . That way people can scroll through comments and add input without having to worry about being spoiled .

1 The first movie scene that I can remember made me cry was the door shredding scene in Monsters Inc . I was legitimately inconsolable and had to be taken out of the theater . It still makes me tear up to this day .

1 Hey ! This is not the narrative we all agreed on .

1 I like what you said about the pit . I mean Bruce is suppose to be 40 years old with no cartilage in his knees and yet somehow climbs out of that motherfucker . I truly believe Bruce was more crippled in his mind in the beginning of the movie than his body . Once he got over his mental and emotional barriers he was able to become the Batman we saw in The Dark Knight once again

1 Totes

1 Though for all but a few select films , which I would own anyway , the special features are dull and rarely worth my time .

1 lets milk this till our eyes bleed , continuing the joke well after its sell by date ... Made me LYL

1 2001 : Space Odyssey is perhaps one of the most realistic . Another is The Andromeda Strain I personally think Alien is plausible . So is The Terminator ( Machines ruling the earth in the future ? Possible ) Children of Men is another totally plausible science fiction film .

1 > if you listen carefully And are a dullard . The two stories are completely unrelated and only have in common the scars being explained .

1 `` Nobody 's leaving , NO , NO , we 're all in this together , we 're all gon na press on and have the hap , hap , happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap danced with Danny Fucking Kay and when Santa squeezes his fat white ass down that chimney tonight , he 's gon na find the jollyest bunch of assholes this side of the nut house . '' i could quote the flip out part if you 'd like . just saying .

1 I like that you added a Sean Connery ess there ! Best Bond ever .

1 The Departed

1 Looks like GM outbid honda on this one then

1 I honestly think this is the greatest film ever made .

1 The logic is Minority Report , you guess someone is going to cause violence and so you feel you are justified in your own violence . The idea of preemptive measures is nothing new .

1 You 're right it was David Alan Grier .

1 11

1 `` Dem dere Nip Naps ''

1 Maybe because Ledger 's Joker was instantly ICONIC and any attempt to recast that role would be suicide . It would be like recasting Jude Law as Jack Sparrow or Colin Farrell as Iron Man . It just would n't work . Plus , it 's a tad disrespectful , what with the whole premature death and whatnot .

1 TIL when a terminator guy jumps into a Merc , it becomes turbocharged and bulletproof .

1 well put

1 Warner Brothers has confirmed that Justice League movie will be completely separate from the Nolan films .

1 Yes ! I actually decided to sit down and watch it by myself for the first time on a large screen and all the blinds shut . It 's the first few minutes of darkness and music that give it that good isolation / deep-space feel . Watching it like that makes all the unnerving scenes so much more effective .

1 I did too , or the trailer itself was controversial . The whole time I was watching it I was waiting for something obnoxious , and then the title came up and I was like , oh .

1 Eh ... to be fair , they censor all the blood and guts out of our news , probably more so than other nations . However , we are probably more inclined to show violence on prime time television .

1 It 's [ Mouchette ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0061996 / )

1 One of the best trilogies of all time : )

1 Hahahaha ! That 's so funny and such a great point ! No one has thought of that one yet !

1 Oh , * that * fucking helps . ^^^^^It ^^^^^does ^^^^^not ^^^^^help .

1 Here 's to hoping all that means she gets nakkid in the flick . Uma is hot the way Cate Blanchett is n't , to me .

1 Did I offend you or something ?

1 It 's actually a she

1 It 's a small plot point , I realise , but can this thread be marked with a spoiler tag ? I thought it might be a bit of a joke post , but it was too late before it was revealed . : - )

1 I was waiting for this line . James Franco is hilarious , and so was that movie .

1 When you 've seen 8 movies written by someone and they 're all shit , why watch the 9th ? I think that 's a pretty damn good reason .

1 Oh dear god , YES . My brother and I quote this all the time . Amazing scene . Robert Shaw RIP .

1 There is some good stuff on there already ( if I do say so myself ) but the more readers we have and the more posters the better !

1 That ... does n't seem possible .

1 I have . I find myself disagreeing with the guy a lot , largely because he picks out minor plot contrivances and flags them as major flaws . Like , really you 're going to critique the way the lake freezes as Elsa runs across it , because it 's not realistic ? It 's magic , and a stylistic choice . I 'm not saying the movie does n't have flaws , but it 's got good messages , twists and music and for me it 's a 4 / 5 .

1 The entire audience burst out laughing when I went to see that . Absolutely atrocious film .

1 This movie made me depressed for a week . It totally change me from a person who finds wars entertaining to an anti-war guy I am today .

1 Read it again . It 's not `` during a diner '' it 's `` during a diner * scene * `` a `` diner scene '' means `` a scene that takes place in a diner '' , just like a `` car chase scene '' means `` a scene that has a car chase in it '' or an `` old car '' means `` a car that is old ''

1 That is not what typecasting means .

1 Cooper was drinking beer with Donald on their front porch , before Cooper left .

1 I do n't think the spoiler is suppposed to be in the title .

1 Hedwig is SO well done !

1 It 's a damn catchy song .

1 One of my favourite movies ever , thanks for reminding me I have to see it again !

1 I miss you more than that movie missed the point And that 's an awful lot girl

1 Her * Majesty 's

1 / u / semialert pointed out below that it 's Kenneth Mars .

1 Just an everyday commute in the land down under , mate . Raise up lights .

1 Is that a serious question ? These are the most marketable titles * in existence * .

1 > which was n't horrible Exactly , so he still fits the criteria

1 Oh , I really liked the movie actually . It was a fun story answering the question , `` what if movie characters came to the real world ? '' Despite being cheesy , which was intentional , it did give a fun hypothesis of how movie characters might act in the real world .

1 Creator of Breaking Bad

1 Plus it sort of seemed a combination of both genres , being character driven and funny for those reasons but also being packed with outside-sourced jokes .

1 Hoffman on the other hand : NSFW https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ornzkdo9t1w

1 Then learn to pay attention during a film ?

1 Joe is 6'5 '' . He 's a beast and would make Henry Cavill ( 6 ' ) look like a midget .

1 I think most people close to the victims would not hesitate to do that .

1 Are you trying to insinuate that Deadpool would LIE ? To Spider-Man ! ? ! FOR SHAME ! ! !

1 What about Crips ?

1 We 've already seen everything .

1 I think the Jedi with the red lightsaber might have been the first glimpse at the new antagonist . We really do n't know right now . There 's nothing to say that the Storm Troopers are bad guys right now .

1 Plus two more who are playing Xavier

1 Chronicle was a very good movie

1 DAY-mun *

1 Lego movie is awesome and I 've been out of my preteens for a very , very long time .

1 Yeah , the show just disappeared while I was in the middle of watching it . So I had to watch it online . : (

1 If it was going to be good , they would n't have to put so many positive words in the tagline THE CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED BESTSELLER BECOMES A WORLDWIDE MOTION PICTURE EVENT OF FANTASTICAL PROPORTIONS WITH GARGANTUAN EXCITEMENT AND CATACLYSMIC SOUND DESIGN WITH GROUND SHATTERING BACKGROUND ACTION AND EAR-BLEEDINGLY GOOD FOLEY WORK .

1 Should have just left work . Thankfully I think / u / girafa is here . Others may be lurking ... in the shadows .

1 Ya , a few people have pm 'd me , and that def seems to be the consensus . Really looking forward to watching this tonight . Thanks for cementing that decision for me .

1 I really like a good ol ' Bruce Cambell cameo and I do n't care how forced it is . Fun fact : Sam Raimi produced Fargo . There is a scene where that non-Steve Buscemi kidnapper is watching TV , the static-y soap opera is actually featuring Bruce Cambell .

1 Your phrasing made me chuckle . Reminded me of the scene in Futurama - `` I am the man with no name . Zapp Brannigan . ''

1 That 's all the proof I need

1 I 've read the book . Its hugely confronting - I do n't even have a family but the idea of not only having your wife in hospital but also having the heart to contact the man your wife cheated on you with so he could ( maybe ) pay his last respects is so ... bizarre . The father-daughter relationships , the wife of the other man , the many cousins staking out for part of our grandfather 's estate . Its all very surreal yet tantilisingly visceral .

1 You have to understand that rape was used in that movie not to entertain , but to develop the character and show you her brand of justice . It 's fucking terrible to watch , but the pay-back scene further along is extremely empowering .

1 Idk why you 're getting downvoted . I 'm getting tired of seeing the same `` comment repost '' in anything regarding Iron Man / RDJ .

1 Would n't really call it a terrible movie , 64 % on RT . but yea , great movie .

1 > Of course Batman has always presented a moral grey area if you stop and think about it , since he 's a vigilante who thinks he 's got the best idea about what is right and wrong and what should be done about it . That 's part of what makes superheroes a fantasy . It 's a * moral * fantasy , where what Batman decides is the right thing to do ( not because it 's what he decides , but because he decides to do the right thing - * and he can figure out what that thing is * ) . Because in Batman 's world , dressing up like a Bat and jumping off rooftops and using cool gadgets and planning and training is going to make the city a better place . That 's part of the appeal .

1 Thanks , I really appreciate that .

1 It 's less British , more De Niro growing up using the Transatlantic accent .

1 He tippy toes .

1 You 'll probably be able to watch Prometheus by itself , but seriously dude . Go watch Alien and Aliens . They are two of the best films ever made .

1 Yes .

1 Sigh , do n't even try to speak sense here . Any comic fan perspective is immediately down voted on /r/movies . You know what would be a 'dark ' FF film ? A ( somewhat simplified ) Hickman adaptation , produced by Kevin Fiege ( aka someone who knew what the fuck he was doing ) . Rather than a random exec at Fox who 's never read a comic in his life looking at The Dark Knight and saying 'say , where can we find someone to make films like that Nolan fella ? '

1 Sauron 's former Boss is winning a great battle against the high elves and is taking over middle earth . One of the human lords serving the high elves fights back while being absolutely terrible at social interaction . Still probably the greates human hero in all of Tolkien .

1 But the this is that 's not his goal . Thanos 's goal is to pretty much kill everything to impress `` Death '' because he loves her . If you ever are interested in picking up a comic one day or to learn more about Thanos and his goals you should read infinity gauntlet ( if you have n't already ) .

1 Spiderman is funny . Jews are funny . Spiderman 's from New York . Jews are from New York . I guess that makes sense to my limited understanding of things .

1 Leprechaun 5 In The Hood

1 Got her number ?

1 It had to be the boardroom scene for me . When he 's shooting through the table .

1 Yeah but they do n't know that . All they see is that no one is buying their online movie , therefore no more online movies .

1 I do not understand why OP ( or anyone for that matter ) would take time to bring people down about a subject they are excited about . This is a subreddit about movies . People are excited about the new superman movie . What more is there to say ?

1 It 's just you .

1 Bigger = Slower

1 I found that the inter-relatedness really came through at the very end . Having issues with spoiler tags , so here 's an excerpt of the book from the very end : http : / pastebin.com / jBTW70vz I just felt that it really came across as a strong theme right then , which held all of the fragments together quite well .

1 the dutchie pon the left hand side

1 I was struck by how different Calgary and the Guard are in tone . The Guard is ( in my opinion ) much funnier and not nearly as dark . I 'd almost call it a straight up comedy , a sort of riff on the Buddy cop genre . That 's not to detract from it , it 's an awesome film , I was just surprised the director was able to pull out two such different feeling movies in an essentially similar setting with the same actors . They seem to share the same universe but they 're very different movies .

1 It had my tears .

1 it 's not a gizmo movie . they 're going to make some bullshit as to how it works , and most everyone is going to waste time trying to figure out why that the bs did n't make any sense and miss the point of the movie

1 Command me lord ... .

1 `` I 've ONLY HAD THREE CANS ! ! '' `` SHUT UP YOU RATBAG ! ! '' `` HAHAHAHA ... Ooh , I wet 'em ... '' Macintosh : `` The goat 's done a bundle ! ''

1 American History X - love it , own it , and yet have not watched it for several years .

1 Oh my God . That was so unbelievably satisfying . I was sad about some personal shit and you personally have literally made me 10 times happier and if no one else gives you the recognition I 'll make damn sure you get it from me .

1 The mist

1 I think there was no black hole beyond the event horizon as we know it , but that the tesseract was the singularity . I thunk Nolan decided he could do whatever he wanted beyond the event horizon when he 's dealing with 5th dimensional beings and extreme gravity , and I 'm glad he did .

1 My grandfather did the same in Vietnam . He said the worst memory was that even though he had a flak vest to sit on , he knew it would n't help much if he went over a mine .

1 Here 's another link : https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=-x08iNZ8Mfc

1 Projecting much ? I said I was in the minority , because this book is a bestseller and getting a huge movie that tons of people are excited over and has thousands of reviews on amazon gushing over it with a 4 1 / 2 star rating . Me being in the minority is a simple fact . More people like this book than dislike it . That 's fine . My book club told me to shut up , told me I was wrong , and acted like I 'd just said I once strangled a puppy with my bare hands when I said I felt the book was shallow and compared it to Twilight . And then you came in and called me a pretentious dick for nothing more than mentioning that I compared the book to Twilight and my book club shit a brick over it . So , you know . I think the delusional one here might be you . You did comment higher up in the thread , yes , but you were only disrespectful to me where no one could see it .

1 Or you could play tf2 .

1 Which is right up my weird alley . The Cronenberg , Argento , and Kubrick homages are too much to bear .

1 He was just in some movie where he had to skinny down .

1 It does seem illogical . `` World War 2 was shorter in this universe , therefore people are less sensitive to violence '' ... uh , what ?

1 The train sequence at the end was actually pretty awesome . My problem with it is that it just really dragged in the middle , and considering its fairly short run time , that was a mark against it . What it needed was more vampires and less Mrs . Lincoln .

1 By no means a great movie , but one of the most entertaining movies I 've ever seen . Love it .

1 > In Bruges If he pushed you of that you are in for a mighty loss

1 It 's impossible - he 's dead and loving it .

1 I can categorically say that he is a bigger bananahead

1 120Hz up-sampling is more natural but can make the picture look terrible . 48fps is the 'native ' way of doing a similar thing .

1 As the old saying goes , there are no atheists when Michael Bay is producing a movie based on a children 's franchise .

1 Definitely my favorite on this thread so far ... great pull and solid analysis .

1 It 'll just spoil my enjoyment of life .

1 ITT : people 's honest opinions

1 I was lucky to see a series of Lang films and from that point have been an admirer of his work . ( That said , I get a little tired of rebuying * Metropolis * every time they find a few more minutes of the damned thing . )

1 Yeah , it 's a series ... but Shinichiro Watanabe is big enough that a lot of people who do n't watch a lot of anime ( and would n't subscribe to those subreddits ) would still wan na see this . Looks like he 's Japan 's Terrence Malick , in the sense that he usually waits six years between directing full features but stacked them back to back this year with this and Kids on the Slope .

1 Haha , you analyzed elements of 2012

1 Yea , but number 4 was awesome

1 Oh , so that 's what the end of the trilogy was missing . You know , when Frodo wakes up and Sam looks at him so endearing .

1 Totally depends on who is doing it . If the Crank guys took it on ? 7-8 . Edgar Wright ? 9 . Though that 's anything of his . Most people ? 2 . This is promising : http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=XqORbzbEfoM & feature=youtube_gdata_player

1 That scene made me a Tarantino fan . Edit : I 'd seen some of his movies before , and I thought they were good , but not the hype that everyone had made them out to be . This scene is what made me want to go back and re-watch to re-evaluate my opinion .

1 Looks like you took a page out of Shia Labeoufs book and copied every other comment

1 Or you know , Tony created a super robot of death .

1 Aw shucks ... you guys are too kind . : ) And , no offense on the first pic , the makeup artists nailed the director 's vision of sickly , horrible looking people .

1 Your compliment was * sufficient * , Louis .

1 When you 're around Batista , that 's an easy feat , man or woman .

1 Shawshank Redemption .

1 This is where the idea of Postmodernism comes from . All you need to do is take the next step and admit that we * ca n't * know what the original meaning is , that * all * ideas are not known , but merely believed . From there , you say that any interpretation can be valid provided it 's self-consistent and you can provide justification for it .

1 This is how I feel about every Seth McFarlane movie / tv show . He is very smart and creative but only uses it to make farting and stripper jokes . I did n't even bother watching A million ways to die in the west .

1 & # 3232 ; \_ & # 3232 ;

1 Are you skeptical because of his acting range or is it just the fact that has n't starred in any action movies ?

1 I went to a rich peoples Oscar party last year with my mom who knew the hosts , and the husband was a Vietnam vet . He got visibly shaken and left the room when Fonda presented and would n't come join the party the rest of time .

1 I dunno , maybe if I had n't seen the movie . Having seen it played with Fox I can not imagine it otherwise .

1 I do n't care what people say , Lea Thompson is * still * Prime Lea Thompson

1 Thank you ! People take their childhood interests way too seriously , mostly due to having their nostalgia goggles on so tight , it 's cutting off circulation . Now , I freakin ' love me some TMNT , but going back to watch the original 80s cartoon just is n't the same experience as a kid . And let 's face it , the Turtles did n't get a really good cartoon until 2003 , and the current series takes elements of the 80s one and makes it * good * . Plus , like all 80s cartoons , the first series was an excuse to sell toys . Not to mention there 's been so many versions of the Turtles ; I 'm sure there were hardcore fans bitching about the darker tones of the comics being thrown out for goofy villains and over-abundant cowabungas . But there was always something to like about each iteration ( well , except Next Mutation . We do n't talk about that one . ) , and I 'm just looking forward to getting to see our favorite heroes in a half-shell on the big screen again after seven years .

1 Yeah , I think for most people it is n't going to make sense . I think I 'm right on the edge of it making financial sense . I might see a few less movies without it , but I do n't think my movie-watching will drop off too much . Will probably cancel pretty soon and see how it goes .

1 Best movie ever !

1 I asked Joss what was up w / Kevin at SDCC '12 and what he said echoed what Drew said , boring looking guy who would have one of those `` Hi , my name is '' stickers that said Kevin , and then would proceed to mutilate the person in the most horrific way possible . According to Joss , Kevin was cut because it was mostly a sight gag that they did n't think would work too well . EDIT : Here 's the panel and my question at the 49:34 mark https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=8dEEHn7ZiXU & feature=player_detailpage # t=2974s

1 You realize NGE is a ripoff of several other things , right ? Nothing is original .

1 I love that creature .

1 None of what you 're saying makes any sense .

1 Yeah since Lloyd is more of a leader .

1 Fuck off ^^^^and ^^^^Merry ^^^^Christmas

1 `` Wan na watch Akira with me ? '' `` No way , I always hated Charlie Brown 's Christmas . ''

1 I 'm seeing the explorers , but I 'm not seeing the family .

1 Given the very different style of that movie compared to most other Disney films , I do n't blame you . As Ebert noted in his review : > In animation circles the word `` cartoon '' is frowned upon , because it makes people think of a film that is six minutes long and stars Bugs Bunny , rather than a film that is 100 minutes long and grosses $ 200 million . I 've trained myself to refer to them as `` animated features , '' but now here comes Disney 's `` The Emperor 's New Groove , '' and the only word for it is `` cartoon . '' I mean that as a compliment . `` Groove '' is not an animated musical telling an archetypal fable about mermaids , lions or brave young Chinese girls . It 's a goofy slapstick cartoon , with the attention span of Donald Duck . The plot is a transparent excuse to string together the sight gags , and the characters are slapped together , too , although they wisely look like the actors who voice them , so in a way we know them already .

1 Troy and Abed in the coooooomments !

1 Yusef , Arthur , Ariadne , Cobb , Saito were hanging out in the van underwater with oxygen tanks , while Fischer and Eames ( posing as Browning ) came up on shore . With no threats surfacing on the water it is implied that Fischer called off his conscious body guards . And from the shore conversation it proved to Eames that the inception worked on Fischer . How long did they stay in the dream level 1 is never explained , but through Hollywood magic we do n't care because we are wrapped up in the Cobb / Saito storyline . Guys ... come on . It 's simple .

1 You should drop the word `` powerful '' from the title .

1 Robin williams - insomnia

1 Damn , I hope so too .

1 Are you saying documentaries should n't be made ? Who 's claiming that a documentary is the end of the issue ? Who are you trying to put down here ?

1 And that was just the Irish .

1 he was with his parents , * how embarrassing *

1 Airplane !

1 My grandfather ( WW2 , European Theater combat veteran ) thought * The Thin Red Line * was completely ridiculous .

1 But - they - do .

1 The alarm clock monologue and user account is still there . It 's the Pale Blue Dot monologue that is deleted and the user account is gone . Pretty sure they doxxed that one as well .

1 Unbreakable I thoroughly enjoyed . The premise of Village , I think , was patently absurd , and the adult characters made no sense in their decision-making . I have never , ever seen imaginary characters of any sort , alien or no , make more ridiculous decisions than the aliens in signs . My point is , I could not suspend disbelief nearly enough for the premises of Village / Signs to really enjoy them .

1 That 's what he * wants * you to think

1 Surprisingly awful film . Like shockingly bad .

1 Yep . I do n't know if she 'll devote half her speech to him again but I 'm sure he 'll get a mention . She was very close to him . Though I imagine Jennifer Lawrence will mention him too if she wins .

1 And Jane Wiedlin , from the Go-Gos . ( She had a cameo in Star Trek IV , too . )

1 I also like how his character in the new series has the LONGEST name in the cast list .

1 I love John C. Reilly , it seems everyone who meets him always has a good time .

1 Hold me closer Tony Danza . Gawd I 'm gon na be singing this all morning .

1 Thanks for getting our hopes up and taking a giant shit on us .

1 The hook is that the Smith family believe that it 's real life . Sort of like a reverse Village .

1 Everyone pack it up , movie 's cancelled , THIS guy never heard of it .

1 Instead of removing it , I put it in the back of the album and labeled that it 's from JPIII , thanks for pointing that out for me

1 Pulp Fiction has held the number one spot in the reddit Top 250 as long as I 've been around these parts . Does n't look like it 's going anywhere either . It 's 80 points above second place while second through fifth are all within about 15 votes of each other .

1 Drive has way better acting , way more depth to the story , and is an all around better experience ... So yes it is just you..

1 Oh really ? I had no idea from the other hundreds of comments saying that . I never said the U.S. should go to war with NK , I said SONY .

1 Really ? I think it 's the best spider-man movie .

1 She 's the lead actress in one of the biggest movies of the year ( hunger games ) and appears to be quite the SAP in interviews . She also apparently gets hell because she 's not waif thin , but only like , regular thin , thus food / weight / haters . Whether it 's genuine or some sort of act to be relatable for fans I ca n't tell , but it seems to be working well for her either way .

1 Tom Bombadil was my favorite part . Not the singing really , but that little subplot was fantastic .

1 Thank you for your reply , I feel like this is a a dangerous pitfall that has n't been discussed enough . With the internet / film criticism / film discussion being so easily accessible , I feel like their is so much laziness and disinterest in formulating your own opinions about the films with regards to quality , symbolism , and themes . This may sound pretentious but I make it a point to either wait 2 full days to marinate my own ideas , and sometimes even watch it a second time to confirm my own beliefs before hitting the forums or rotten tomatoes . I 've been doing this for about four months now , and it has made watching film so much more enjoyable .

1 The big thing that did n't feel right through the whole trailer was the voice . Hard to get past that after seeing Steve in so many public appearances .

1 Did you know that the bite of a spider is n't always the worst part ? [ Urticating Hairs ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Urticating_hair ) on a tarantula or similar breeds are the bristles on a spider 's back that they flick off with their back legs , and the little barbs lodge in your eyes , potentially causing blindness , or severely irritating rashes on the skin !

1 Well , I hear Colin really hates Bruges .

1 So ... 'You have it too ' ? What 's that about ?

1 I say a whole series of shows , game of throne style with more roman-esque / persian armor . Call it a `` Tale of the King of Kings . '' Change the names . Than on the final episode be all `` It was the Bible Bitches ! The Bible ! '' or have the Jesus being born scene go down ... either way .

1 Your first mistake was expecting something of quality from Meyer .

1 Really ? I was n't expecting much from it , but was actually surprised how much I ended up liking it . The pacing is fairly tight and it does n't waste your time , so I 'd have difficulty in describing it as boring .

1 20 years

1 And they have to be in a `` non-sexual '' context

1 Yeah , I was responding to your joke with one of my own but it fell flat . : /

1 No one 's complaining about the visuals . It definitely looked cool . People are complaining about the story . The movie tries to make you think it 's deep by throwing a bunch of complicated symbolism at you . But in reality , it does n't really have anything much to say other than perhaps that faith is good . Its trying to trick you into thinking it 's more intelligent than it is by being confusing . Also , most of the story is brought about by the characters ' stupidity .

1 The actual lighting of the fireworks was great . Just ... .nothing . Then cut scene . Perfect . The other hilariously subdued scene was when Rod was explaining the plan in the ice rink , then finishes off `` Ok , let 's celebrate . '' Next scene , all of them silently popping bubble wrap . Flawless .

1 the car chase in Raid two really made the movie for me . Fucking loved it .

1 Hollywood OS

1 That 's the joke .

1 Why the downvotes ? I love the movie , but it failed to make any money at the box office . Simple fact .

1 I bought so many America 's after seeing that

1 Great movie . Went in hoping for porn . Got a great and shocking tale with an unexpected ending . Loves the narration that they 'd never talk again after meeting in the cafe . So solid .

1 IMAX 3d is horrible for cross talk , just garbage . You ca n't even lean your head left or right .

1 Do you even lift ?

1 I second [ Grizzly Man ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0427312 / ? ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) , it 's an amazing film , but as the title suggests , focuses more on the man - and his descent into madness - than the animals . Watch it anyway .

1 Thanks , seen it !

1 When you have one of the best ensemble casts ever * assembled * and spend several years moving around a few billion dollars building up a multi-arc storyline bridging a dozen movies ... Yeah . I do n't expect something that looks like it was cut by an editor listening to executives who wanted to sell toys without having a 2hr45min long movie .

1 Inception does n't sound like any of those other scores you named , but yeah , what do I know !

1 I 'm just surprised that you did n't kill him where he stood right there and then .

1 I actually really loved this movie . One of the more original films to come out in the last decade .

1 Its out now ...

1 ssh !

1 mental masturbation for atheists . As a rather strong atheist , this movie did absolutely nothing for me . It 's target is on a very specific niche of people who are on the borderline between believing and not . A lot of the humor comes at the expense of people who have no idea what they 're getting into ... it 's like it Borat took itself seriously ... and it kinda made me feel dirty all over . Bill Maher is his typical smarmy douchebag self , and if that 's your thing , then you 'll probably enjoy the movie .

1 Even after hundreds of times , this remains true .

1 I completely agree with your friend here . I could n't help but feel upset at the final 10 minutes . Do n't want to give away any spoilers obviously , but the end ruined it for me . I 'm not usually a critic , I just think I went in looking for something and did n't receive it .

1 I thought the soundtrack provided one of the most terrifying soundscapes ever . A lot of the music reminded me of Ligetti which was also effectively used in The Shining .

1 I thought that line was heartbreaking .

1 Moon came out of WAY left field for me . Awesome flick

1 Are you on crack ? The Neverending Story has the best theme song ever . EVER .

1 So panhandling means something different than what everybody thinks ? `` Why were you in the bathroom for so long ? '' `` I was panhandling ! ''

1 Tax incentives does n't mean tax free . They still collect tax , they charge the production use the street , it brings in jobs , it promotes the city among industry .

1 God yes , I watched through the extended editions three times in a week ( standard plus director / actor commentary ) and I still wanted to go back and see them again . They are n't perfect , but to me they 're damn close .

1 He states that there are `` other characters involved , '' so who knows ?

1 I think people completely misunderstand the point of Upham 's character . It 's established from the beginning that he 's done various non-combative roles up till that point and has n't been `` dulled '' or `` hardened '' like the others . He 's initially the only one who wants to free Steamboat Willie instead of execute him . And he finally `` loses it '' at that pivotal scene . Why ? * Because war is a terrible , traumatic thing and it affects people differently . * We scream at him to not be a pussy because it 's a movie , but there 's no telling what we 'd actually do .

1 * HULK STRONGEST ONE THERE IS ! ! ! *

1 I have wanted to see the non-pg version since seeing that scene . `` THIS EPISODE WAS BADLY WRITTEN ! ! ! ''

1 It 's like watching a foreign film , only occasionally you hear an English word .

1 It was absolutely stunning . I 've never seen anything quite like it .

1 You can just say no , no I did not .

1 You forgot anonymous employee at faceless corporation ! ( Malcom )

1 Well they did reference the fact that Scotty developed the formula which made it possible to transport at warp speed . The whole thing with `` its not the ship im moving , its the space around it '' from the first film , makes the possibility to adjust the photon torpedos to the same thing . They supply enough information to make this plausible . The problem with the phasers however , would be that they could only fire within their own warp bubble , but that has been a topic since TNG : )

1 is n't that the question of the day ?

1 Goodwill or Salvation Army . Thrift stores have tons

1 Could not disagree more . This was the first movie in a long time I did n't look at my watch , and I see a ton of movies ( living in LA I get to see all the limited release movies as well as the bigger ones ) and I rarely do n't glance at my watch , even in good movies . The pacing was really great and even though some of the stuff had been spoiled for me , I did not see the ending at all .

1 I felt the same way . It 's not really a scary shock / gore type horror film , just offensively disgusting things that leave you uncomfortable as hell for days . ( specifically , two scenes of it , so do n't be fooled by the trailer if it does n't look that bad )

1 I know , but by showing a massive long take as `` great '' and a bunch of poorly done quick cuts as bad , you might give them the impression that quick cuts are bad and good directors use long takes . You did n't really explain what makes one of them good and the other bad , so it would be easy to interpret it the way I explained

1 I hope so . She reminds me of Tilda Swinton . We need more Tilda Swinton 's .

1 So the characters do n't act like you did when you were 40 ? That 's hardly a compelling argument .

1 You posted a picture on imgur of him just because it 's his birthday and called him a magnificent bastard . Ya went full reddit , hombre .

1 Come on man , this is hardly the film to masturbate to .

1 1 . I was thinking the same thing before they got to that question . He 'd be an awesome `` get '' . 2 . Then Gene 's answer to the podcast question made me say this in my head ... '' You get nothing ! You lose ! Good day , sir ! `` ... which I was really projecting at myself for thinking of # 1 .

1 not really

1 They want to remind you of a lot of photos from the making of A New Hope back in 1976 .

1 OP mentions both .

1 Came to say this .

1 Rex Reed got the plot of Cabin In The Woods completely wrong , added details that did n't exist and he was kind enough to spoil the ending without so much as a warning . It was like watching that 3-year-old explain Star Wars except it was sad , not adorable .

1 Hang in there Joan .

1 Upvoted for Triangle - a really solid horror / time-travel film . Watched this last year knowing nothing about it and was pleasantly surprised .

1 * Unbreakable * .

1 You put Gangs of New York that far down ? Darn . To me it 's second to the Departed . Granted I have to see Wolf .

1 No . We ca n't .

1 I went through it and no , there are n't 25 movies worth watching . It 's mostly TV shows . I also think that most of the stuff that I would miss most is personal preference and not worth telling everyone to watch . Except Karate Kid . I ca n't believe those fuckers are trying to deprive the world of instant Ralph Maccio .

1 You need to have a third party do the `` woosh '' . You ca n't do it yourself when someone does n't understand your sarcasm . Also , your sarcasm was worded poorly . What would have worked better is something like this ... I ca n't believe the nerve of Clint Eastwood using is celebrity status to influence the political process of our great country . I much prefer actors that stay out of politics like Sean Penn , George Clooney , and Alec Baldwin .

1 You ca n't be sure if the Shai-hulud rider is male or female . But yeah ...

1 Kubrick , particularly a Science Fiction from him

1 I do n't like Die Hard 4 or the Transporter series , but people probably dislike Die Hard 4 more because the Transporter series started out idiotic , and the filmmakers know they 're making stupid movies . Die Hard 4 was a sequel to a really good franchise ( maybe not Die Hard 2 ) and they just pissed all over everything that once made it great .

1 You could randomly watch Netflix movies without reading the description . That might get you a similar effect .

1 I agree with you . I prefer the look of film ... But this thread was about preserving a print that already exists . There is zero reason to not prefer digital as a storage / preservation medium . The other big upside to shooting digital vs film is cost . Film is expensive . And there are movies that exist now , good movies , that simply would n't have been made because of the cost of film . A couple of people can just decide to make a movie . And that 's it . And it might be really good . And it would n't exist but for the cost and availability of digital capture and storage .

1 > Senior animal trainer Mike Alexander and a team of four experts spent a total of 19 weeks preparing the critters for their film debut . Once the animals became accustomed to sitting with the trainers ( each squirrel was trained one-on-one ) , they were taught to pick up a nut and place it in a metal bowl . The bowl was eventually replaced by a conveyor belt for the film .

1 Oh and maybe the fact that he owes the IRS a huge sum of money .

1 He actually looks like Bill Compton from * True Blood * , to me .

1 BRRRAAWWWWWWPPPPPPTTTHHHH

1 There 's so many `` versions '' of Batman in the comics , though .

1 While that is enticing I 'm not sure if it would make more money . Say the one guy kicks in 30 bucks or whatever and gets a ticket . Months go by , he receives the ticket and remembers he donates , and then tells his buddies `` yo , I got this ticket to ST2 , you guys wan na roll with ? '' And then the friends come too , paying admission at the gate . Some people might be uneasy to donate now , but when the hype re-starts and there 's an actual trailer I 'm sure scenarios like this happen more often than not .

1 As someone who did ( So happens to be Interstellar . In King of Prussia , PA . ) . It 's something else . Sure I can say more detail and what not but I will tell you , you will see nothing but the movie in front of you . The way a real IMAX theater is designed is so you as the filmgoer , is totally immersed into the film . Top , down , and side to side ... All you will see is the film . And the sound ... Oh man ... The sound ... It 's amazing . Please take the time to at least see one film in 70mm IMAX .

1 Yep . I came here to post this , but instead , I shall upvote you into the heavens my friend .

1 Yup . It 's a very pretty movie but the visuals were a little too gimmicky for my taste .

1 * Event Horizon . * Only * Alien * comes close , IMO .

1 > Humble and like-ability are part of Holzier 's charm and that jumps of the page of every interview . If I ever was lucky enough to interview this guy , I 'd ask him , `` Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like ? '' Because I 'm pretty sure this guy might just have the answer .

1 How much would it cost to rent a party bus to take 10-15 people from Buffalo to Hamilton , Ontario and back for a concert next week ?

1 How was it pretentious ? That 's a word that gets thrown round a lot . It 's not pretending to be better than it is , Matt and Ben are pretty smart guys , if you doubt the intelligence of the script then you 're wrong because everything checks out , the sentimentality is real , and a lot of the script is drawn from experience . The concept and characters are all fully developed - so how is it pretentious ?

1 From the article you linked : > I got a photo of him on the set of `` The Dark Knight '' trying to kickflip over Patrick Bateman or whatever the actor 's name is that played Batman .

1 I agree , I think her voice is perfect for the role of a Bond theme . Also in some ways I do agree that they played it quite safe with a much more traditional throwback to James Bond 's history . However , I believe that this is actually the intention . Daniel Craig 's Bond has stepped away from the origins and into the traditional individual story , this will be the first time that Daniel Craig plays 007 in the same vain as Sean Connery or Timothy Dalton . Therefore bringing back that older more iconic style of theme song . It also has a eery sense and is actually quite dark in tone , most likely to fit the style of Bond . Personally , I am hoping that the next Bond after this steps out from tradition again and gets crazy with it 's storytelling and score .

1 HEY . In the Last Stand he carried a TV and said `` She took off , Bro . '' Vital to the plot . EDIT : Jokes aside , I met Daniel Cudmore once and he seemed like a very nice man . It 's a shame the movies did n't do the character justice .

1 Even in the books Fili and Kili were just known as , young ? They did n't have much character , in fact , except for Balin , Thorin , and maybe Dori , none of the dwarves have any characters at all . The story is about Bilbo , and as the book progresses , he takes more and more prominent role in the company . Which is the exact opposite of the movies .

1 Either you 're cherry-picking vaguely Star Warsish details out of thousands of dissimilar details , or you did n't read the books at all . By that logic , I could say literally every book series that involves the archetype of The Hero 's Journey is ripped off Star Wars .

1 That 's one of those movies that I have n't seen in so long that I barely remember it .

1 I just watched it the other night , fantastic job by him .

1 Actually Park Chan-Wooks entire revenge trilogy . Sympathy for Mr . Vengeance ( 2002 ) , Oldboy ( 2003 ) and Lady Vengeance ( 2005 ) . All great .

1 Good point . Sounds much more like the general bridge operations background noise . Either way , it 's damn effective .

1 The best part of Galaga !

1 Great Gatsby is coming out for the millionth time

1 It 's already forever imprinted in my head ...

1 May your hammer be mighty !

1 It 's not just the overuse of CGI , it 's how it fits into the story and the world of the story . The Marvel movies are flashy and have a consistently CGI feel - they 've always been like that , it 's expected and they usually use it to tell decent to good stories . The CGI in the Hobbit feels out of place to people expecting to get the same Middle Earth from the Lord of the Rings , and the prequels do n't feel just like the Originals visually because of changing effects and filming techniques . They are n't necessarily bad - they just are n't what people expect or want , which causes the backlash . I also think the Hobbit became overly reliant on CGI , which eliminates certain limits that can be good for a film . So we get big CG Orc villains pasted over the actors in far better looking makeup , or a CGI dwarf where it would have made way more sense to use an on set actor . I really think Jackson wanted to make an animated film .

1 Wait , so they are having trouble getting tech support from Sony ? Wow , I thought I was the only one .

1 They mean you look like a douchebag , they 're just being nice .

1 If your watching Pacific Rim for the dialogue or acting then you are watching the wrong movie , The only reason you should be watching Pacific Rim is because it 's fucking Monsters vs Giant Fucking Robots . https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=fupWquPNoTc

1 Those are pretty common films . I 've seen all but one or two and as far as I can tell all are easily available and frequently shown on cable .

1 Sign me up for this .

1 Comparing the doorway sizes between the car the house and the helicopter seems to show they are reasonably close in scale to one another . The helicopter door would be roughly man height and seems very similar to the house door though you ca n't see the house door size exactly due to the helicopter being in the way . The car door looks about the same height as the door in the helicopter which is wrong but not massively off in scale .

1 That 's speciest !

1 Read the article ...

1 With a slo-mo of an attractive woman screaming

1 No it is still worth the watch , your still on the edge of your seat . And there is still a lot to learn about the story . Plus Rosamund is amazing .

1 The elements are extremely harsh and they have to keep moving to find shelter and food and escape the wolves that are constantly chasing them , not to mention the fact they are constantly being hit with icy wind and are stranded in sub zero temperatures . Not as simple as you made it out to be .

1 The director 's cut is creepy as hell . More little things like that sprinkled through the film .

1 What do you think he was talking about ... ?

1 > It won a Golden Globe for best animation No it did n't .

1 Actually Michael Bay 's comment was ? These turtles are from an [ * alien race * ] ( http : / screenrant.com / michael-bay-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-origin-sandy-159820 / ) , and they ? re going to be tough , edgy , funny , and completely lovable. ? I 'm relieved to find he has gone back on that quote now , or in his opinion explaining that he was talking about the ooze . But either way ... .. I 'm not sure yet how I feel about this movie .

1 God ... dammit ... Janglesmith

1 Pair that with the milk from the opening scene and you 've got yourself a little taste of paradise .

1 k .

1 I liked the movie more than the trailer .

1 The chosen one .

1 `` I did n't write that joke . ''

1 Well yeah , it 's an Evil Dead movie

1 And giant guns are also not very mobile . The Kaiju moved very quickly for something so big .

1 I 'm all for it . Reese Witherspoon started her own production company fairly recently with the same intentions , and their first productions were Wild and Gone Girl . Undoubtedly , there are plenty of potential female-driven films of incredible quality that simply wo n't be made unless the women themselves lead the charge in getting them produced . The powers that be simply are n't interested . And it is n't just women , obviously . It 's an unfortunate truth that if the underrepresented people in the film industry wish for their race / gender / sexuality to receive more attention , then they must band together and enlist the help of anyone who shares the same sentiment . This is the only way that movies like Wild or Selma ever see the light of day .

1 I remember seeing that at the movies and everybody screamed when that scene happened then everybody started laughing at each other and themselves b / c this is supposed to be a kids movie .

1 That was off the top of my head . The theater I was in on opening night laughed at all of those things . How many jokes are there in any given dramatic action movie ? Why does the TDK trilogy have to be funnier than Heat or The Departed ? Which it was , by the way .

1 A lot of things would have made IM2 way better .

1 he was the funniest character on the whole show ...

1 The girl he raped ? She was 13 .

1 Umm ... .. what did I just watch ?

1 There is no need for this comment to be in this thread .

1 Maybe a dark roast with whipped cream would be more appropriate .

1 I 'm being a * little * facetious

1 Perhaps he meant `` domineering '' . : P

1 Oh yeah , there are many very funny scenes like [ this one ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=dAE7uOO_4v4 ) .

1 Mud was a great movie . Same director as Take Shelter

1 as graceful as a slinky on an escalator

1 Calm down dear .

1 John Carpenter 's the Thing is n't the original one . But anyways , it is without a doubt the best horror movie I 've ever seen . All of those movies are pretty well loved by humans , though . Just not critics in the 80 's ...

1 For me , Elysium was unbearably bad , and Chappie was awesome . No District 9 , but still very entertaining . Other than Yolandi 's acting and Hugh Jackman 's character having absolutely no reason to do anything he did , I thought the whole thing was great .

1 Video is probably snabbed from trailers.apple.com .

1 [ My reaction right now . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / 7SPrsVt.gif )

1 I do n't think those pillars are usually solid stone -- I 'm pretty sure they are typically plastered .

1 I think its amazing that an actor in blackface got nominated for such a prestigious award in this day and age . Certainly the role was a foil and play on that theme and absurdity of it , but still it was pretty gutsy going and nominating it . I think Ben Stiller even called in a bunch of journalists or something to make sure it was cool .

1 shut your dirty whore mouth .

1 The Way directed by Emilio Estevez

1 No idea what you 're referring to . Nobody is hating on DC or Marvel .

1 If you have n't seen Alpha Dog you should check that out , because he really makes you hate his character in it .

1 Yes ! If you look through my post , I LOVE everything Pixar does . But Brave did n't hit it for me . I mean , it was good . But I did n't give me those goosebumps that Wreck it Ralph did . Let 's make out own Oscar and send it to Disney studios !

1 That was a great one . The way he messed up was brilliant .

1 Highway battle scene from Captain America : The Winter Soldier

1 His godlike destructive power leads to the Dawn of Justice False God storyline

1 I 'm 100 % ok with that . It 's like he was made to make Ghost Recon , not like there 's a story I need to worry about him ruining .

1 Michael Jeeter also played Mr. Noodle 's brother Mr. Noodle on Sesame Street . Curiously , the first Mr. Noodle was played by Bill Irwin , one of William 's closest friends . We went to see Irwin in * Who 's Afraid of Virgin Woolf * and sat right behind Robin about 5 years ago .

1 He does n't try , he is an action star .

1 reddit it getting stupider , at least the big subs - too many kids on here

1 Cinema Paradiso ! It is unforgivable to exclude that film from a list like this .

1 > but since the first Daniel Craig Bond film my expectations for Skyfall were very high . Oh , I definitely agree with you there . Skyfall ca n't hold a candle to Casino Royale for me . The latter was just top notch on * every * level .

1 Saying Richard Curtis is a Kiwi is like saying Emma Watson is French .

1 The Pixies - Where is my Mind

1 Well let 's bear in mind the limitations with what a title can be . Yes it could have been called ... 'Captain America : Hydra infiltrates SHIELD and turns Captain America 's old best friend into the Winter Soldier who SHIELD then have to fight , along with Hydra , to protect the world ' . Might have been a bit of a mouthful though .

1 Just keep in mind if you watch it , it 's based off a half dozen anime series which span decades . You 'd have an easier time jumping into a random episode of Star Trek .

1 Dear god yes ... I ca n't believe someone actually wrote that while thinking about a JP sequel . As a standalone movie it would suck ... But as a JP Sequel ? Oh man ...

1 I think they did the `` crack smoking '' scene , but it was n't this long or hilarious , IMO .

1 that one was called `` Every Comedy ''

1 Hey now ... He learned something in that movie .

1 The year 2130 , Rocky Balboa is a memory forgotten by the world , the ACFL ( American Cyborg Fighting League ) has become predictable and these cybernetic fighters have become complacent with there matches and skills . Red Steam , the most feared Cyborg in the ACFL wins every match by knock out and leaves no foe standing . The President of the ACFL sees this issue and sees no one is excited about the league . He makes the Decree that for the first time it will be Man ( cyborg ) vs Machine . The president of the ACFL decides to place a Brain impression of a gutsy Italian boxer that his grandfather often spoke of in the Robots AI , allowing him to have all his experience and moxie but with the body of a Robot . Thus we have Rocky IV , With Fist of Steel and Black Boiled Blood .

1 Really ? Why ? It was an amazing music video .

1 Plastic surgery sure does slow time down .

1 Disney just spent $ 4.2 billion on * Star Wars * . They wo n't make another acquisition until they break even there . Also : even though Marvel / Disney does n't own the film rights to some of their characters ( Spider-Man , X-Men ) , they own something that is arguably more important : merchandising rights . This means that Sony gets the profits from the films , but Disney gets the profits from the action figures , comics , etc . Merchandising is * far * more profitable than films . So the * Spider-Man * films Sony risks hundreds of millions on act as free advertising for Disney 's licensing and merchandising businesses .

1 TIL

1 Oh fuck . Forgot about that .

1 Yeah , I would say you 're being snide . And considering your last sentence , I do n't think you understand the meaning of the word .

1 Fishing With John . Probably the funniest thing on Criterion .

1 I saw both and it 's nothing like Identity Thief . IT sucked . The Heat went far above my expectations ( imo the trailer made it look like it was going to be bad , so my expectations were low ) .

1 Gone Baby Gone is amazing , I actually prefer it to The Town .

1 Gypsy tears .

1 Yeah , he did it decades before Dinklage . I loved him when I was growing up in lighter things like The O-Men and Time Bandits , and even Tiswas . And then as I got older he was spectacular in genuinely serious roles in things like L.A . Law. In that he played a far more serious character than Dinklage has ever done , and dealt with dwarfism on a much more adult level ( for instance , that great , depressing drunk conversation with Jimmy Smits where he admitted his beautiful girfriend was a hooker ) , while also doing episodes where it was n't the issue , and he was just a manipulative bastard lawyer . Then he killed himself . One of the few celebrity deaths that actually genuinely made me upset . A fantastic actor .

1 I would love a sequel to the 80s one . Follow the priest as he reintroduces the new Blob to a massive city like New York or LA . Shawnee Smith and Kevin Dillon could both come back ( they 've aged gracefully ) . Chuck Russel is a more-than-competent filmmaker and I 'd have total faith in him creating an entertaining sequel .

1 Less spoiler reply : He was * just * born in the movie : )

1 People might not even try to pirate anony 's film at all . Have you seen how hard it is to find certain obscure underground films ? If nobody knows about your little project nobody is going to distribute it illegally . Piracy is positively correlated to popularity . The more people that legitimately watch the film the more people will pirate it . It 's just a reality but the same goes for video games too .

1 American Psycho . It made me realize that there are people out there like me who just want look great and murder .

1 I do n't think it means what you think it means .

1 I remember Matt Damon was making fun of George Clooney and said about Batman and Robin that people demanded their money back after watching it but `` what they really wanted was their time back . '' I get that it was a throwback to the Adam West days but it was just too far in that direction . They should 've made Adam West Commissioner Gordon or something in it though .

1 Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan

1 I have seven ideas . 1 . Green Goblin , the father did n't die , and his `` death '' was the end of his humanity entirely . He gets frozen , or moved into some kind of mechanical stasis , he shows up and tries to take back Oscorp . Harry fights him to protect the company . 2 . Carnage / Venom , they are testing the Symbiote out on criminal `` volunteers '' who got ghosted after getting a `` death sentence '' , basically Oscorp fakes their deaths and scoots them away to a black site where they can do very illegal things to them ( and / or they claim it 's a `` Serum '' to stop violent behavior or something ) , Kasady get 's exposed to it and goes on a rampage . Oscorp uses their money and resources to keep the rampage as quiet as possible why the Sinister Six play detective and hunt his ass down . Think `` Seven '' , Kasady gets a god complex and spends the whole movie taunting and tormenting the Sinister Six . 3 . Black Cat steals something important from Oscorp , the Sinister Six is assembled to go after her and get her back , after it 's discovered she is super-human and womps on the normal Oscorp guys , it would be very `` Globe-trotting '' with a very fun 60 's spy movie vibe , with them chasing her , and it could lead us through some foreign locales in the Spider-Man universe . 4 . The Sinister Six are used for corporate espionage , and the film is them hitting a variety of rivals of Oscorp , and we could feature some organizations and locals outside of Oscorp , this could be combined with idea `` 3 '' too . 5 . Introduce Morbius , and it 's them trying to get him back , it could take a darker turn , as Morbius is eating his way through the criminal underworld and the media thinks it 's Spider-Man , so there are gangs and the police out hunting Spider-Man , but it 's bad for business so the Sinister Six or organized to catch him . 6 . They are introduced as `` Heroes '' to New York , and Spider-Man knows it would look bad to directly challenge them , so the B-plot is Peter Parker playing detective proving the Sinister Six are bad , the movie ends with them revealed to be the villains they really art without a big `` fight '' . Actually have Peter just be Peter for most of the movie and use his brains to defeat them . 7 . They are trying to clone Spider-Man and accidentally create Kaine , a psychotic degrading version of Spider-Man , this idea would be similar to the Morbius idea .

1 You have no idea what a first world problem is do you ? This is n't an issue of I want something , but I 'm just to lazy to get it . It 's a issue because of some other asshole being an asshole . If it gets bad I 'll get a manager , but by that point I 've already asked people to stop fucking with the phone and I 'm wasting 10 - 15 minutes of the movie getting someone to boot the phone user out . > It really is n't that uncomfortable to sit in the front row . Fuck you it is n't . I already have neck problems , being a tall fella and learning my head back for an extended period of time is a painful experience for me . I should n't have to do that , and I should n't have my experience watered down my some twat being on his phone . You can say you 're not defending texting / phone play , but you are . You 're trying to make light that people are expected to change their time at the theater to accommodate someone already breaking a basic rule of the theater .

1 The only thing cautionary about it is that the same doubtless , uncompromising and driven egomania of the narcissist and the cool , collected demeanor of the confident , experienced man are indistinguishable on first contact . Weinstein cut him loose when he realized the difference .

1 Get the DVD .

1 Stop trying to black-ify my whitesploitation movies ! Everyone knows that James Bond has to be a white British man , like George Lazenby , to work in this deeply intricate canon that is a perfectly tuned continuity !

1 That still would n't have fixed the biggest problem with that movie which was that most of the conflict was driven by supposedly brilliant scientists being complete idiots .

1 > edit : did you just report my post ? to myself ? / dies

1 Eh , Oscar schmoscar .

1 Yeah but not having a `` no animals were harmed '' tag means absolutely nothing . The only reason you ever see that tag nowadays is as a joke in a CGI movie about animals . Most people would never ever notice whether that tag was or was n't shown in a movie , and most would n't care .

1 I watched this one day out of the blue and I was greatly surprised at how unique this movie was . I highly agree with its dark humor and its writing so surprising ! I enjoyed this movie very much . If anyone is curious , it 's a stop motion animation I believe set mostly in black and white about a kleptomaniac and a girl who write each other letters .

I love having serious conversations about this stuff too , but it 's frickin Batman vs Superman vs Cap 3 ! At the end of the day everyone in this thread is going to watch both and decide which they enjoyed best . Do n't take all these discussions too seriously , after all , the movies we love do n't always take themselves too seriously either .

1 Personally I think Mark Sheppard excels at recurring roles and TV appearances . I ca n't see him having a leading role but put him in a TV show and he will be fantastic . Then again , he is now a main cast member for season 10 of supernatural so I could n't say

1 I do n't think it 's necessarily being able to higher a `` better '' design crew so much as more money to spend on experimenting with different materials and also more of a lead up time to filming , TV will generally have a shorter turn-around / pre-production period than film .

1 * Closes monocle . *

1 Because money : (

1 Jesus . That English is broken .

1 It 's actually more like ( from a mod perspective ) - 85 % Transient Users who do n't care a lot about movies - 10 % Dedicated Users - 3 % marketers - 2 % spammers

1 I know people love scary movies , but Ouija just looked too stupid to bother with , while John Wick looked awesome and was awesome . Get your shit together people and go watch a good campy action movie .

1 Someone already did .

1 I do work with Marvel , and they are quite a bit more paranoid ever since Origins : Wolverine leaked . Like Big Brother paranoid . They use secure satellite uplink to send their films , but the films themselves are encrypted and need an unlock key which itself has a time component on it . This means that the film is unviewable off the server until the key has been verified so even if a theater has the film ahead of time , they ca n't phsyically play it until the time-stamped key says they can . Honestly , knowing what I know about Marvel 's security measures , I almost think that this could only be some kind of viral marketing ploy . The stills are nice quality and of a non-spoiler variety so I 'm guessing these were distributed with Marvel 's consent .

1 What an intelligent comment . I think your keyboard is missing a few letters by the way .

1 `` Mean Girls '' is so fucking quotable . `` OH MY GOD DANNY DEVITO I LOVE YOUR WORK ! ''

1 I specifically try not to wear logos whenever I go purchase clothes . There 's not a huge reason for it other than not wanting to represent anything without researching it enough first . The only way somebody will know that I wear Hanes brand socks & boxer briefs is by either removing my shoes & pants or by reading this comment .

1 New Favourite Phrase `` Moonbats Crackers ''

1 I think people labeled him a hero because he saved lives of other soldiers and marines from the shots he took . His first kill for instance he saved a convoy of marines from a person throwing an grenade .

1 I still love the whole King Gay bit , especially when they leave the smoking hut and as they 're running Peter stops to giggle at the joke again

1 That 's because the Transformer franchise was little more than jingoistic recruitment smegma .

1 I 'm with you all the way . It was a decent movie with some good , original humor here and there , but holy shit is it overrated . Some parts were just cringeworthy too . That ending where Starlord dances to distract Ronan was one of the stupidest ass-pulls I 've seen , and I ca n't fathom why people thought `` lolsorandom xD '' crap like that was funny . The forced romance between Starlord and Gamora was as cliche and predictable as they come , and I hate how Groot is now a fan favorite because people just eat up ultra-repetitive catch phrases like toddlers . Drax and Rocket were the best characters .

1 the thing with Deadpool is that he isnt as well known to the general public as other Marvel Heroes and to stay true to the comic means its a R rated film which means you cant market it to kids . I personally think if done well fantastic four could be great . Casting is key to these movies because of how well people know the characters . Thats why Iron man is so well received while both spiderman franchises both get so much critique

1 The Arkenstone plot crosses across all movies . It 's Thorin 's secret motivation for his quest and his character is developed ( really well ) because of the stone . As Bilbo says , `` the stone has changed you '' and `` the Thorin I met back in The Shire would 've never turned his back on his own word '' . > the battle which is just a bit over a chapter in the book is dragged over half the movie . Same with the Battle of Helm 's Deep in Two Towers .

1 `` Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot ; but make it hot by striking . ''

1 * Heartbeeps

1 My first thought as well . It would work perfectly as a short film . And a beautiful , sad one at that .

1 Gandalf wanted them to walk and he knows things . It isnt hard to imagine what would happen if they were flown to gondor considering boromirs story .

1 I saw the play in middle school . It was stupid .

1 Yeah , I was actually more impressed with how much of the set was actually existing prop pieces than the CGI screens themselves . I thought a lot more of it was CGI'ed .

1 What are you talking about ? It has a [ 7.0 / 10 ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1706620 / ) on Imbd , the same as [ Tropic Thunder ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0942385 / ) got ( not to mention Snowpiercer also got [ 84 / 100 ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1706620 / criticreviews ? ref_=tt_ov_rt ) on metacritic ) . Like , where are you getting this information from ? It was very warmly received . It 's true that Imbd score was lower than rotten tomatoe 's , but that 's usually the case . Imbd mixes user scores with critic 's scores , which I never really liked . What you can say is that the film was n't a big hit in terms of tickets sold domestically , managing to only make [ 4.5 ] ( http : / www.boxofficemojo.com / movies / ? id=snowpiercer.htm ) million in domestic gross .

1 As crass as it is , this is all I remember .

1 What a champ to keep functioning after that ... I would probably be on the ground drooling

1 SPOILER ALERT ! Do n't read if you have n't seen it .

1 Every time you pooped , Elvis sang [ this ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=kJ6yAYHsHqg ) .

1 Pretty sure when this review refers to the `` once-great filmmaker '' it 's talking about the director , Atom Egoyan . You generally do n't refer to the lead actor as the `` filmmaker . ''

1 What kind of swimming pools do you go to & # 3232 ; \_ & # 3232 ;

1 he is n't the greatest , but there are worse , and plenty .

1 Ah , looks like they 'll be driving cars in this one .

1 Plus , the movie was underwhelming and the acting was incredibly stiff for the most part .

1 And this is how I know you do n't work in Hollywood .

1 I think it made it all the more clear , that Bale and Adams were going to screw over Cooper more than anyone else in the film .

1 Totally agree with you . From what i understand however , the movie had poor screenings which is why they chose to include the v / o work by sutherland -- for those incapable of understanding the plot ( ? ? ? ) .

1 Gnnn nnn dnnn fnnnnnn !

1 Would you watch him raise 3 chipmunks ? Would you watch him do it 3 times ?

1 Ca n't say that 's not true , but the old saying comes to mind- `` guns do n't kill people , people kill people . '' He could have crafted swords Shinto shrines or special occasions . However , Hanzo stated- `` I am finished doing what I swore an oath to God 28 years ago to never do again . I 've created , `` something that kills people . '' And in that purpose , I was a success . I 've done this because , philosophically , I am sympathetic to your aim . I can tell you with no ego , this is my finest sword . If on your journey , you should encounter God , God will be cut . '' upvote for you = )

1 I do n't know , I only felt admiration for her . I wanted be strong like her ... and hopeful avoid dying like her . I guess women are n't strong the way she was , in movies . Plenty of men are , but very few women are . Seems a shame , cause I would * buy * any movie with a lead like Carolyn .

1 To be more specific , he invented them !

1 They ca n't hire Tarantino , but they can make a deal with his production company . HBO airs his movies all the time .

1 Sinister Six here we come .

1 yeah this movie looks like absolute shit . Emma Watson is pretty much the entire selling point . ridiculous .

1 Hey I just learned about it from you.- so Thanks !

1 Water is wet , the sky is blue , women have secrets . Who gives a shit ?

1 I enjoy the first , love the second , ca n't stand the third .

1 I prefer the first one marginally , but I 'd agree with the sentiment

1 That 's Natalie Dormer . She 's from Game of Thrones .

1 Dude , do n't even joke about that ! No way that 'd ever happen .

1 Yeah ... That 's a Polydor album and , I 'm thinking a European release . In the U.S. , his label was Reprise , and the album cover looked like this : http : / www.amazon.com / Electric-Ladyland-Jimi-Hendrix-Experience / dp / B000002OPP / ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & qid=1290859468 & sr=8-1

1 If it 's so great , then why did they remake it 6 years later with time travel and chainsaw hands ?

1 This is the the first time I 've seen this in this thread . This is so accurate . A woman can not go through depression without being labeled a 'crazy bitch . '

1 Especially the ones from Avatar . I was too distracted by the overall shittiness of that movie to even pay attention to their garden-variety guns .

1 I 'm sure the vast majority of far-right Americans reacting to the movie this way are Christian .

1 Well the way most comics have had to deal with this when The Fantastic Four , Spiderman , The Avengers and X-Men were all in or around New York was to just ignore it and have an occasional crossover . If Spiderman ever appears in an Avengers movie I think they 'll just do that .

1 Wow , I actually said 'That is awesome . ' when I saw this . Great one !

1 Orphanage was freaky .

1 He doesnt have all of them , but many people think the gem inside Loki 's staff is one of the Infinity Stones We know for a fact that Thanos gave Loki the staff , they mention it specifically in the movie It would seem strange to me that if Thanos was in the possession of one of the Infinity Stones , he would just give it away to Loki

1 I almost lost it in the theater . So sad ...

1 > Only the computer somehow also acquired a will to uphold the constitution and sees its own government as a threat to the people of the United States , so it goes rogue , killing its operators and plotting a regime change . High ranking government and military officials will be eliminated . I actually thought this was a really neat premise for a movie - similar to Asimov 's `` Zeroth Law of Robotics . '' And of course during the Bush / Cheney administration it was incredibly topical . However , the execution was incredibly flawed for all the reasons he cited ( I 'm incredibly forgiving of movies , and even I was rolling my eyes at the computer controlled cranes ) And of course the anthropomorphized computer with the eye was just stupid . I 'd rather see something like WOPR - just a box with a bunch of lights and Richmond saying `` See that light ? I do n't know what that means . ''

1 My pick is Goodfellas , but Casino is like Goodfellas ' brother that just gets overshadowed . Casino would be most directors best movie .

1 It took me a while to realize that it was * A Bug 's Life * vs A Bug 's Life . I thought they were comparing the movie to itself

1 * claps *

1 Well he did go to Juilliard . And roomed with Robin Williams , might I add .

1 They would n't . Harrison is a rogue agent .

1 Wow , that 's amazing . I remember the first time I saw this on reddit . Less then 30 seconds after the Comic Con reveal of the `` Batman / Superman '' movie .

1 Insomnia is very underrated , imo .

1 Probably wins on the visual side of things , but the sheer ass-kickery is off the scale in Ip Man .

1 The HP fandom does n't need another Doctor Who to be in the HP movies , David Tennant was enough to satisfy fans .

1 Looks like it 's on netflix . I 'll have to give it a watch .

1 It actually isn ? t a movie about a serial killing tire , it ? s a movie about a crowd watching a movie about a serial killing tire .

1 Check out lean gains .

1 Your title is inconsistent . You begin with A ) and then say 2 ) instead of B ) . A ) 2001 : A Space Odyssey 2 ) Lost in Translation

1 No , deus ex machina is * resolving * plot with plot elements which never existed before then . It 's not about being `` fantastic '' . A drug , magic , or a god is not a DEM if it exists in the plot beforehand . If you have Ares come down to Earth and say he wo n't help you , the Son of Ares , because you 're not a brave and worthy warrior , then demonstrate a brave act but ultimately fail in every way , then Ares comes outta nowhere and say `` you impressed me , so I 'm killing off the whole enemy '' it 's NOT a DEM , even though a god is literally involved .

1 Agreed . This makes me very sad . Way too young . He was a class act .

1 In my opinion , it 's an extremely fast-paced and self-aware comedy ... it veers into absurdism , juxtaposition , screwball comedy , witty banter , and visual gags , and mixes them into an excellent brew of humor and entertainment . While other `` classic '' Disney films are more `` story-driven '' , in my opinion this particular film is very `` comedy-driven . '' Definitely worth at least one viewing .

1 MA ! WHERE 'S THE MEATLOAF !

1 I had a dream like that once .

1 So , Idris Elba ?

1 Oh , wow . That 's the first time I 've ever considered her , but Gina Torres would 've been an * amazing * Storm .

1 You should go watch The Great escape .

1 Wow , that 's pretty ambitious for them not to subtitle the lines in Vietnam .

1 The rotation is exactly what creates the artificial gravity ( through centripetal force ) . The [ Wikipedia page ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Artificial_gravity ) does a decent job at explaining it .

1 Ugh .

1 Actually , was n't it based off of their fantasies more than anything ? Basically , it was what they * wanted * to happen on their last day of high school with some of the random characters they knew ( McLovin , the bully , stoner cops , etc . ) .

1 Uh huh .

1 Is n't the tatum that area between the arse and the chocha ?

1 > vader no ? [ Vader No ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=WWaLxFIVX1s )

1 > Interstellar is somewhere in the middle . Ambitious and flashy but has a really dumb script hiding behind a curtain of science , and widely discussed technical issues . I do n't think DKR was bad . I loved it ! And I really liked Interstellar too . But I do respect your opinion . He is my personal favorite filmmaker of the last 5 years , and although I do n't think his films are profound in their stories , they are remarkably well done in their assembly .

1 I often describe this movie as a dark cross between Baron Munchausen and the Princess Bride . Two of my favorite movies , but I must give The Fall the edge . That damn little girl was brilliant , and the visuals were spectacular . Also , seeing the movie on the big screen and knowing nothing about it was a nice surprise .

1 ... which is a nod to the famous * Requiem For A Heavyweight * -- another character drama about a life that starts out feeling triumphant and exciting and enriching , and ends in horribly tragic `` burnout . ''

1 What an awesome job . Any time you get to say `` slime that area more over there '' is a fun day .

1 All the things you disliked about the movie are the reasons people liked it . All I can guess is , you must have watched the movie upside-down and in reverse . ; ) But seriously , do Austrians know of Dirty Harry ? Dredd is kind of like that .

1 People make the mistake of thinking that they are trying to be psychological movies that are watered down with action when the intention was to make an action movie with some nice cerebral ideas

1 The decision i mean . Last movie was 2012

1 Does it matter ? I 'll bring the twizzlers and you can find out !

1 This dude picked one movie and based their opinions on millions of people from it . My comment is no more ignorant than that

1 From what ive gathered from Reddit , he is just becoming his character from Civilisation .

1 Yeh , if you 're taking about the first one it strayed into black comedy for a few reasons but had tree rape and other crap . Second one did the exact same thing but better . Third one let Campbell extend his character and was great for it . It 's so much fun .

1 Except that the line should be `` Alas , poor Yorick ! I knew him , Horatio . . ''

1 Sadly , a movie done so poorly it will never be touched again

1 Why Do n't You Play in Hell ?

1 https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Za3G8aLSF0c # t=28

1 wow

1 Because those movies arent apart of the MCU . They 're made by fox , not Marvel .

1 Why ? Tumblr is like the one place in the entire existence of anything ever where women obsess over sexually attractive male celebrities more than men do females ones . Let them have that .

1 Why would he need a voice recorder if he had a laptop

1 Yeah that 's exactly what I said to my friend . Exactly met my expectations , but did n't quite surpass them .

1 More like over 30 years and because the Imperium may have fractured with the loss of the Emporer , may even have factionalised but may not have been entirely destroyed .

1 instantly heard `` IAN FREEEEEZEEE ! ! '' in my head

1 Probably to allow for more facial expressions . Prosthetics added to an actor 's face do n't do quite as well at conveying facial expressions I imagine .

1 I was having trouble deciding who I thought was the best scrolling through these . I ca n't believe these two movies were in the same year and ca n't believe you could ever choose anyone else .

1 Does n't seem like enough ? Have you even been on Netflix ? There 's thousands of movies to watch . I never have time to watch anything , cause there 's so much . I 'll only be losing 14 movies in my queue out of like 150

1 [ Okay ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=pWdd6_ZxX8c )

1 They wish ...

1 When they show you the whole movie it usually means the movie stinks unfortunately .

1 I 've never seen the movie , but it * is * called * The Assasination * of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford . You kind of assume he 's going to die from the title alone . : P

1 Thanks for crushing my faith in humanity , asshole . ... fucking Garth Brooks .

1 He grew up playing D & D , he 's a huge nerd and he 's talked about it in interviews before . This is n't that surprising , but it is clever .

1 The Man from Earth does n't get enough love . It would make a bloody good play too .

1 You caught me . I was n't going to risk it . No way .

1 `` It 's the thin vener of kindness - no one is that nice ! ''

1 That seems to be the default setting these days . Everybody wants to be the next Red Letter Media , or `` everything wrong with X in 4 minutes '' or `` how X should have ended '' , and go looking for reasons to hate things .

1 Well no shit that it wo n't stay at 100 % . But a 100 % rating after 16 reviews is a strong indication that this will be certified fresh with at least 85-90 % by the time the last few reviews are submitted .

1 Love the book , hate the movies

1 When people say that Stallone is a shitty actor I make them watch Cop Land .

1 Being John Malkovich , Adaptation , and Eternal Sunshine are some of my favorite movies of all time . I was so pumped when I found out Kaufman had a new movie out . I thought it was completely pretentious and obnoxious . I wanted the movie to have a face so I could punch it .

1 I do n't go to a lot of first day screenings , usually just early shows a couple weeks late . I had no idea that the clapping at a movie thing was n't just a meme about Americans clapping at everything

1 Yeah not like audiences , who all arrived at the opinion that * Fight Club * was an underrated masterpiece independently . Or who voted * Avatar * way into the top 50 on IMDb the year after it was released and then called it the most overrated movie of all time the year after that . Critics play follow the leader all the time , but no more than any other group .

1 * I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE ! I DRINK IT UP ! ! *

1 That 's not a bad idea . There are many people on YouTube who still `` swede '' videos .

1 `` Or maybe , since I * knew * you 'd know , I spent all day thinking about the wrong ones . ''

1 A clear case of form over function ; it looks pretty on a wall but is next to impossible to get any information from .

1 If you wan na see Tom Hardy cock about 10 times . Dudes night it up .

1 Battlefield Earth was a very good adaptation in my opinion . Completely unwatchable movie for a shitty unreadable book . Good job .

1 The guys who played Harry and Lloyd did a remarkable job of playing the way that Carrey and Daniels played them , but it 's just a shame that the premise and dialogue was so terrible . Oh , also the very short short-bus was brilliant .

1 Catching Fire was in theaters for 19 weeks . This is week 8 for Mockingjay . This was not some bribery scheme to get it ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy . This is just how things are . My area also has Interstellar and Big Hero 6 showing as well .

1 That whole movie makes me smile / cry no matter how many times I hear it .

1 13 Assassins is glorious .

1 > now it 's nothing more than a B grade movie you would expect from the ScyFy channel . Man , I wish I came from the same universe you did where Sci Fi channel movies are like the matrix

1 A lot of theaters have discounts for the first showing , too ! Well , the two by my house do ...

1 [ Finally found a version without the stupid crackling ! ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=S_LcUq5iC5g )

1 Neat comparison ; misses that a lot of those Cambodian inches involved a lot of generic post-Vietnam discussion and a lot of apologia and doubt , including a controversial moment by Chomsky that 's still debated whether he himself engaged in pro-Rouge apologia or not . Even accounting for that , it 's still a striking comparison and says a lot about how narrow our interests can be . Timor needs more examination and study . Ironically , despite what that image shows , so does Cambodia . The Rouge continues , to this day , to get away with what they did . edit - shit , I looked again to examine the dates . Specifically 75-79 , which covers the height of the Rouge . Vietnam itself went into the country in December of 1979 and that 's when a lot more information about what was actually going on under the regime came out - before then , it was a lot of horrible 'rumors ' discussed and occasionally dismissed by people like , yes , Bob Dole and Jesse Helms . Major coverage of the Rouge atrocities started in the 80 's , often while some of the holdouts were still causing havoc . Abductions and murders by ex-Rouge were still occurring in the mid 90 's . That makes the column inch comparison that much more striking .

1 Going Clear will run on HBO from March 29 , 2015

1 Nice try , James Cameron .

1 [ Everything he says is a stitch ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=LifEjXPl1Ak )

1 He has no range . He only plays a select group of characters and to me , they 're insufferable . They range from smug asshole to pretentious loser .

1 All Google searches return infinite amounts of boobies and bondage .

1 I kinda want to sub Julia Roberts out of most films she 's appeared in . Except Notting Hill .

1 Started off amusing . Got pretty tedious . Glad I stayed for the end .

1 I think that might have been the joke .

1 The primates at the beginning always scared me when I was a little kid . Still get kind of scared watching them today . Amazing movie .

1 I 'm happy people find it an interesting movie to talk about in any capacity . Still , I do n't know that Room 237 is making any claims beyond exploring a handful of the most fascinating symbolic interpretations of The Shining we could find ( and hopefully saying a little about the way people struggle to solve all sorts of mysteries ) . And although I 've got no problem with people calling 237 'a well-structured and thought out conspiracy ' or you know , whatever they like - I think there 's only one conspiracy covered which takes up under 10 minutes of a 104 minute film .

1 Hope in one hand , shit in the other . See which fills up first .

1 Any Jar Jar is too much Jar Jar .

1 Those are some big words , what dictionary did you learn them from ? You did n't credit it ...

1 I 'd say because it says 2015 on the poster , but there 's no fault in your logic either !

1 Yeah , I believe this is called `` damning with faint praise ''

1 Came to say this . Well done sir . 4 rooms was awesome

1 `` i get to walk around really weird for * how * long ? sold ! ''

1 It appears they 've recently done some renovation to the school !

1 What do you mean by switch ? Cooper is only ever able to influence gravity in the past . There is no post-wormhole cooper in the past .

1 Things DC / WB did well with that movie : Casting Kevin Spacey and Brandon Routh Things that DC / WB did poorly with that movie : Everything else

1 Holy fuck Kung Pow was hilarious .

1 Beware , as there are some spoilers in this link about how the movie opens and its general structure . Basically , the director said he sent them a copy and they thought it was `` fantastic , '' but there are n't any direct quotes from them . http : / www.scified.com / site / godzillamovies / toho-has-seen-godzilla-2014-and-they-loved-it Actually , I 'll just copy the relevant passage : > director Gareth Edwards mentions that Toho got to see the entire film and they apparently loved it : `` They saw it yesterday and I got an e-mail saying they thought it was fantastic ! '' he said . `` So that was a relief . ''

1 I think that 's because the oppressed in this case was a woman .

1 That 's actually pretty bad ass .

1 I actually enjoyed the movie beyond that . But yes with the generation X age group , we have seen some shit . I do not consider it a bad thing . In the end movies are about entertainment , and thanks to having a comparison I was entertained , making it worth my money .

1 Came here to say this ! I know he 's the villain , but he 's my favorite character in the whole movie . He has such a personality !

1 He 's saying `` we 're talking about a being ... '' and I think it 's supposed to sound like someone angrily interrupting to call him an `` alien '' instead .

1 Theres way too many theories that dwell into the end , but thats what makes it so good . You do n't really know

1 Fight Club . Even the author admits that he liked the changes more .

1 Why shit ? Because you did n't like the film ? > BB is very brown , TDK is very blue , and TDKR was grey / white / black .

1 And still directed by McG unfortunately ...

1 Alice eve half naked is always necessary

1 Hell yeah ! I know people absorb bits and pieces from movies their fans of , but it 's awesome to see someone who did n't just eBay a cheap imitation watch or sunglasses , but went balls out and did the * experiences * shown in the films . That means so much more !

1 That Gladiator 2 movie sounded awesome , in the most batshit crazy way . It 's a shame Hollywood does n't have the balls to make it .

1 Or that covering a phone 's mouthpiece actually does stifle the sound ? I ca n't stand the narrator 's voice either .

1 Just because different people have different thresholds for what might count as pussy whipped does n't make it any more okay to say . It does n't matter if he is calling me something , it 's disgusting nonetheless .

1 That was rotoscoped .

1 I ca n't even learn most of those pen spinning tricks . I 'm practically obsolete already .

1 Actually , that 's what happened in my mind . Have n't read them in ten years I think . Might be due for a re-read .

1 The horns the robots made were awesome in the cinema . So majestic !

1 His rules apply well if one does have a firm grasp of punctuation though . To render his sentence differently : `` * That 's how I 'd do it . A good rule of thumb is to write how you 'd speak ; commas for short breaks , periods for longer ones . '' * People phrase what they are reading in their head - if there is no time for the hypothetical 'speaker ' to breathe while speaking , then the sentence becomes clumsy and stressful .

1 Because the MCU is built on telling an ongoing narrative . Pre-Craig Bond was not . So if AoU does n't further the plot then it fails at one of it 's main jobs .

1 Why did n't they just take some dinosaur DNA from a mosquito trapped in amber and splice in some frog DNA , they would n't have had to bother with cgi or animatronics or anything . They could even make them all female so they could n't mate to keep the population manageable . They could even put then on an island in the middle of the ocean so they could be contained . It 's foolproof .

1 here 's an article written by one of Farrow and Allen 's step children discrediting what was said in your article . http : / www.people.com / people / article / 0 , ,20783306,00.html

1 Shhh , we are currently observing wild youngling on the internet , still naive and uncorrupted . See how the eyes are still bright and full of vigor ! The mind yet to be polluted and tainted with generations of hidden filth ! It probably still believes its parents only copulated once , and its grandparents stopped sometime in the last 50 years . How wonderful .

1 SO^EDGY^SO^EDGY^SO^EDGY^SO^EDGY^

1 That was my favorite one !

1 I loved everything about the movie . Jake gave one of the best performances I ever seen . I was on the edge of my seat , the whole movie . Also I have a thing for very dark thrillers , and love nighttime settings . Thought it had a perfect ending .

1 Striking distance - If they did n't want him to make waves , they should n't have put him in the water . I 'm not kidding . That the real tagline .

1 You probably should have heard of all those movies if you care about movies enough to come to this sub .

1 Please save your money for something better . This film is quite bad , but really it 's just because it 's dull . In particular if you are looking for that Will Smith charm , you are just not going to get it here . He puts in a 100 % serious performance in dry monotone . He is n't even on screen most of the film as he has a broken leg and spends the entirety of the film stranded on the crashed ship . The film exists for one reason : to make Jaden Smith into a star . This kid has the majority of the screen time which is unfortunate because frankly he 's an awful actor . He has no timing , no flair , no personality whatsoever . Not only that , but most of the film is just him fighting off boring standard CGI monster after boring standard CGI monster . The plot is the most narrow , single-purpose plot ever written . It feels like the plot to a TV episode more than a full length film . Look , just do n't bother . The CGI is boring and unremarkable , the visuals muted , the direction sloppy , the acting bad , the writing worse and it 's just so goddamn dull . If you feel the need to spend $ 15 for this then just go see Star Trek Into Darkness or hell even Fast & Furious 6 because at least those movies make you feel something . Look F & F6 is very dumb , but at least it appreciates it 's own stupidity and makes up for it with really excellent action and a light hearted script . AE is just dead and all I felt after it was numbness and an overwhelming sense of cynicism towards Will Smith .

1 Indiana Jones & The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a shithead .

1 The Warriors . [ One of the characters straight breaks a chair over a woman when they fight The Lizzies . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? feature=player_detailpage & v=aEVCeFJnrhI # t=106 )

1 I 'm gon na take a wild guess here and say that this movie is not meant to be taken too seriously . As in , there will indeed be many comedic parts . Like that Canada line . Which I thought was pretty funny .

1 yup brubaker is aweome

1 That bath house scene was just brutal

1 It was supposed to have a sequel .

1 Yeah , what did you think it was . Granted it takes a certain level of quality to get 90 % of critics to agree a movie is good but still .

1 Just found the birthday present Im getting for myself , thanks !

1 Methinks this is the beginning of people suggesting Joss Whedon direct everything . Evolution of the Firefly circlejerk I guess .

1 time travel .

1 I too am moist .

1 one of my favorite movies this year . it perfectly captured spider-man in a way that made it seem like a saturday-morning cartoon . it had problems , sure , but so does everything in this thread

1 I only stopped reading that as one title when I hit `` Lord of the Rings '' .

1 My friend and I contend that Ben Stiller 's character is every Guitar Center employee across the nation .

1 If you 're judging the characters in MiP on believability , you 're missing the entire point .

1 I feel like everyone should rent / buy this one . It could be a giant data point for the Day 0 digital distribution of movies .

1 How are they screwing people if they deliver just what people threw money at them for ?

1 they probably could put dirt on things because it would 've taken too long to render . this is both a joke and not a joke at the same time .

1 Right ? I feel similarly about Batman Forever , but Batman and Robin was obviously the worst of the two . I had all the toys and everything . I watched it recently , and I 'm blown away by how bad the dialogue and acting are in that movie .

1 It 's just his boss 's dry cleaning ...

1 Well , I must say ... As far as Channing Tatum 's upcoming films , I 'm definitely looking forward to this more than Jupiter Ascending . I 'll give Foxcatcher a shout out too .

1 It did n't bankrupt the studio . It made over half its budget

1 The Chaser is fucking awesome .

1 I disagree . JGL was what Harvey Dent should have been . He was a citizen of Gotham who fought against all of the crap in the city because he was inspired by the Batman . He proved Batman 's success among all of Bruce Wayne 's failures .

1 I 'm with you here . I really , really wanted to love Birdman and love his other films but I agree with you .

1 mediastinger.com has been updated , no extras .

1 Seriously ?

1 Exactly . This picture would have been interesting whether or not Ridley Scott was in shot .

1 Same with Jerry Seinfeld taking comedians for coffee while filming and Deadmau5 taking musicians out for coffee and filming it

1 Arent Mothra , King Ghidorah and Rodan confirmed for future Godzilla sequels ? & Japan is kicking off another season of Godzilla films starting next year . It 's a good time to be a creature feature fan .

1 I think your view is a bit too simplistic . McQueen 's movies are viewed as works of art and they stand separate from his persona . He is not a tabloid celebrity like Jolie who sells her wedding and newborn baby pictures to People magazine and is mostly famous because she is a gossip fixture . Comparing those two and reducing it to male / female categories is way off base . I was n't a big fan of 12YAS because in 2013 / 14 I think there should be different and braver movies to tell the struggles of black people , but it is clear that the movie had a hand of a talented director . There are these rumors that Jolie had a director on set to guide her and she was just 'playing director ' . She was constantly doing photo ops with her kids in Sydney . I doubt a 'real ' director has time for that while shooting a movie .

1 Like not having McG direct .

1 Ive seen it , it really is a great film

1 You know someone already edited them into full movies , right ? Here 's [ Uncharted 2 the movie ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=YfAkg0s7_iA & feature=youtube_gdata_player ) for example .

1 Yep , I think he was trying to complete the pub crawl as best he could . He gathered clones of his friends and ordered drinks from one of the pubs along the crawl .

1 I loved Baby 's Day Out .

1 I was responding to his point about a movie that does something so new and effective deserving Best Director and Best Picture nods . I did n't like Gravity . I did n't mean to rustle jimmies . I 'll just step quietly away .

1 He retired 9 years ago

1 If they pulled it off it would be on the same scale if not better then LOTR . They should follow the story of the first one .

1 Nah , we still need a James an Seth season , as well as Jonah Hill and Micheal Cera , and then Bert and Ernie .

1 > Bob Oedekirk Steve Oedekerk . Bob * Odenkirk * is someone else .

1 Coen Brothers , Jon Favreau , P.T . Anderson , Wes Anderson , wait wtf did you just stick Jon Favreau in between a bunch of good directors and refer to him as a serious director ?

1 I personally love this movie . Great action and martial arts sequences , if a bit fanciful and ridiculous . As an overall package , I think it 's a very funny and well-rounded whole of a story .

1 Richard herrings RHLSTP is a great substitute for nonsense chats .

1 Believe it or not , there are a lot of people who did n't read the comic books but watched the movies based upon them .

1 And you just spoiled it for anyone that has n't seen the trailer and is reading this thread .

1 Clearly , you 've seen * The Hunger Games * recently ...

1 aka `` the Bard ''

1 When I re-bought butcher bay it came packaged with it . It was of the same quality but I could n't get into it . I think I just missed the butcher bay storyline and wanted to go back to it and play again .

1 Are n't we all just someone else 's kids ?

1 Because her limbs are not based off of hydraulics , more based off of artificial muscles .

1 I did n't feel like Prometheus was a remake / rehash of alien . To me it felt like a story set in the alien universe .

1 Did n't Joss announce his Scarlet Witch first though ? I mean Days of Future Past was filming when Joss announced it , and I 'm fairly confident that Singer wanted her first , but you never know .

1 Sam Worthington is just the most boring person ever filmed

1 I took 'Splosionomics with Prof . Michael Bay instead .

1 RDJ is hands down one of the biggest movie stars right now . People will pay to see a movie solely because he is in it . Is that not not what a movie star is ?

1 Rick Moranis would kill it in a Wes Anderson film . That would be such a great way for him to have a comeback . plz wes plz rick

1 Glad to hear you 're excited , trailerspy.com employee .

1 Goddamn , I have rarely been so insulted by a film .

1 As do I , as do I .

1 In a perfect world , DDL : `` Challenge Accepted . ''

1 'Who are you ? And how did you get in here ? ' 'I 'm a locksmith . And I 'm a locksmith . ' Man , I quote that far too often , even though there never really is good context for it to be in .

1 Salmon Fishing in the Yeomon

1 How can you say Leto is much more dedicated ? Simply because he got really fat for a role and really skinny ? That is n't the only way to show commitment .

1 > The rule : she wo n't watch a movie with less than 4.5 stars This was my rule too.. until I started watching movies with 3.5 and 4 stars and realizing there were a TON of great movies out there with lower than expected ratings . Most of the top documentaries on Netflix are ~3.8-4 stars and they are excellent , the only 4.5s I 've seen have been some old classics by David Attenborough.. I do n't think I 've ever actually seen a full 5 star rating on Netflix . Remember , user ratings are altered by Netflix to account for what Netflix thinks you might personally like . The star ratings do not equal exactly what users rated the movie , heavily influenced , but not exact . As far as I understand anyway .

1 Petra Parker . I can get behind that .

1 And that is when we begin the murder .

1 Also destroying Tokyo

1 I am not saying your take on it is wrong or anything but for me I really liked him as him . Him playing an Eastern European didnt affect my viewing at all .

1 [ He calls himself 'Ghost Dog ' ? ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=PgeCL2KdU_I )

1 Oh . Fuck .

1 Honestly , its got to be Pirate of the Caribbean : Curse of the Black Pearl . Unfortunately , most enjoyable aspects of that film got beaten into the ground in the sequels , but damn , that movie was so much fun when it first came out .

1 I 'm glad you enjoyed it . I fuckin loved it . I thought it was a fantastic adaptation , as far as adaptations go . I thought he played splendidly , although that Weeds woman still gets my vote for the Hollywood guillotine .

1 Hooray ! Finally , someone who sees Sin City for the paper-thin piece of hackery it is .

1 The new phone books are here !

1 Not a black hole . Instead it 's the most realistic-looking wormhole I 've ever seen in cinema , with accurate gravitational lensing effects .

1 got ta give credit to how they used to make movies my friend showed me this powerful image a few years back [ shown here ] ( http : / globalspin.com / wp-content / uploads / 2009 / 06 / george-lucas-now-and-then1-460x363.jpg )

1 Being John malkovich . It 's about a ventriloquist who finds a portal into the actor John Malkovich 's brain and then things get even weirder from there . It 's hilarious , original and really smart . And of course , it 's on netflix instant .

1 The Guardian only spews out negative stuff about The Hobbit . They did the same with Spielberg and Jackson 's Tintin . So far the majority of those who have seen it love the HFR .

1 Do n't thank me , thank [ this guy ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / w0a7j / the_50_best_movies_youve_never_seen_by / c59clhx ) for answering you .

1 french horror is mostly just extremely violent with a stupid or bland plot . Thank god we got james wan who knows horror is n't just excessive gore .

1 Eh . I liked the stories better , but the point was that Harry Potter was more lucrative , famous , and , well , better .

1 That is n't the way you cast actors . If he tests for a role in a science fiction film , and fits the part , he gets it . It 's not a meritocracy . Also , the Star Wars series is n't exactly known for great acting .

1 Mecha hitler

1 Brokeback Mountain was his greatest performance IMO .

1 I have a gun , in my room , you give me five seconds , I 'll get it , I 'll come back down here , BOOM , I 'll blow their brains out !

1 Ontruegod , Ondancer , Onprancer , Onvixen !

1 Capaldi is almost worth it on his own but the cast generally is ace . Still amused that Super Hans is in it ; it 's my new favourite cameo since Sheldon turned up in the Muppet film .

1 Wow , I 've never met another person who thought like that . I do n't understand it any more than you do . Thanks for having an opinion

1 Why ? Do n't let someone else 's opinion of a movie change yours .

1 Right . They 're bad guys , and they do bad things to people . Loopers are afraid of `` letting their loop run '' for a reason . The guys in the future ca n't afford to have the past changed . There needs to be examples made of . Let your loop run and you get fucked , big time . We saw how terrified Seth was after his old self escaped . I think there 's precedence here . It 's known , let your loop run and you get fucked up .

1 Number of times Indy dies in fridge = # of ears split due to Willie Scott 's screaming . It is all relative . I submit to you the amount of audience suffering in one part of * Crystal Skull * is equal to the amount of audience suffering in * Temple of Doom * . However , if you want to talk about cool parts in each film , * Temple of Doom * has a lot more cool parts . That 's my main gripe with criticism of * Crystal Skull . * It was n't that it had implausible parts or over the top parts , because that 's what Indiana Jones is about . The problem with * Crystal Skull * is that it did n't have enough cool parts to make us forget about the silly parts .

1 Goodfellas writes the book on film editing , then tears it to pieces and writes it again . There 's faster editors , and few just as good , but there 's no one * better * than Thelma Schoonmaker .

1 It 's the only movie that can make me laugh and cry at the same time .

1 This was the best example I could find out there that 1 ) was relatively good quality and 2 ) did n't compromise the scene by cutting parts or changing the aspect . Road to Perdition is one of my favorite movies , and while the plot and acting , especially on Newman 's part , are fantastic , the direction and cinematography really cemented it . Mendes filled this movie with beautiful transition shots ( The road to Chicago , the bank robbing / driving practice , the main titles ) along with moving , dark sequences like this and the other murder sequences ( Hanks ' wife and son , Craig 's character , and that final scene ! ) . The most defining thing about this scene in particular is Mendes ' choice to not only forgo the sound of rain , but even the sound of the men and the gunshots . When scene sounds to come in , Newman says `` I 'm glad it 's you , '' the machine gun screams through the night , and all sound drops for a moment . What we receive is a beautiful scene and one the best shootouts in cinema history .

1 The message of the movie was never that the world is better off with humanity being dead . The planet itself was dead already . The world as in our world our hierarchy our way of life and our society was all just minimized into the space of that train . It was the same functions the same desires , the same goals and conflicts but rather encompassing nations and continents it had moved onto the sections of the train . Curtis was given a choice . By both Nam and Wilburt . To either continue the cycle of society and our way of life , or to take a risk to start a new . It was never about destroying humans , it was about destroying the world that we had created , the society we had created , it was about destroying the segregation of classes and abuse and conflict from our greed .

1 It differs , I 've known people to pronounce it sex , kex , C-E-X ( how I pronounce it ) , Computer Exchange

1 They were playing off the title `` Film of the Year '' , but I like the more literal translation , that it is in fact a film from 2015 .

1 Share the load .

1 So it 's Fast * and * Furious ?

1 I 've had milk shoot out my nose while laughing but never beer . Until now .

1 Well sure , * Alien * is more of an ensemble movie with a traditional survival-of-the-fittest thing going on . It 's still worth putting on the list because Ripley is as much a main character as anybody is in that film .

1 I watched that movie on acid . It was ... intense .

1 Its a strange world on reddit .

1 Have you ever seen films / read books ?

1 Conquest by the White Stripes

1 He won an oscar for this , got ta be overacting .

1 Ummmmmmm ... ... ... The general idea was that only one person gets to live ...

1 The two are not exclusive

1 And what a massive douche he turned into .

1 Because people like train-wrecks .

1 Well shit ! I just watched this over the weekend and was enthralled . I thought it was wonderful and like all subtitled movies i wondered in the back of my mind if they were getting it `` right '' . Why do they feel the need to dumb down everything sent to America . When I saw Ringu I loved it and high hopes for The Ring but it was so dumbed down I was kind of insulted ! DAMMIT !

1 Anything from smallville .

1 Edited the format `` I heard you hit my son . Why ? '' asked the Mob Boss `` He stole John Wick 's car . '' the Car Stripper replied `` Oh ... .. '' The Mob Boss hangs up phone and shits bricks

1 In all seriousness , OP gave his reasoning for why he enjoyed the costumes . To me , they never seemed like anything to write home about , but they were n't a big issue . OP explaining his position helped me understand where he was coming from and I actually agree with him because of it . This is unlike you , who states they thought they were the worst aspect of the films and does absolutely nothing to explain why or how . I ca n't agree because you did nothing to further your point .

1 I let out a slight moan of pleasure .

1 This has been , by far , the best article on Ender 's Game . I fell in love with the book when I was in middle school and reread it almost every summer . I really think it formed a lot of my feelings about the world and made me feel , as a child , less powerless than I thought I was . I subscribed to OSC 's newsletters years later in college and was shocked when I saw his extremely bigoted views on homosexuality and religion . Ultimately , I unsubscribed to his newsletters , kept the books and still read them from time to time . Even though the author himself is unsettling , the books he crafted gave me solace and that 's what I treasure the most . I can tell this columnist feels the same way and I 'm glad he was able to put together the feelings we share so eloquently .

1 Now we 'll never find out what was on Page 47 .

1 I read this like it was Steven Tyler singing `` Dude looks like a lady ''

1 I do n't think you can call someone with almost 2.9 million Youtube subscribers `` underrated '' .

1 Robocop 2 was the biggest selling game on the commodore 64 !

1 Well maybe u / WorkoutProblems did not know the reddit definition of meme , and was looking for clarification . Or something crazy like that .

1 One of the packages comes with a mustache . Imagination is always free .

1 Limitless is a pretty good movie though . Dont let one stupid thing prevent you from seeing a movie . If you can get over most stupid things in sci fi movies yoi can get over that

1 Damn , it Murray

1 Yeah , there are loads on YouTube usually following the format * Title of Movie * + * with the Dragon Tattoo * . I 've seen ones based on [ Jurassic Park ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=PiY09XY1vNw ) and the TV show [ Community ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ggFBOhUk-Ss ) . Although the one that I think is actually brilliant , and I just discovered it there now , is the [ Lion King with the Dragon Tattoo ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=hAydVArjPMQ ) . Even just the use of the sunrise , man !

1 No , because Lincoln did none of those things . When he was n't being a badass , he spent his time as a two-dimensional portrait on a coin .

1 But Michael Bay , amirite ?

1 I never really liked Rosamund Pike until Gone Girl . She was absolutely brilliant in it . EDIT : damn autocorrect

1 And because Shannon Tweed ...

1 [ Except it 's not true . ] ( http : / www.nationalreview.com / article / 384176 / justice-jesse-ventura-was-right-his-lawsuit-j-delgado / page / 0 / 2 ) They had only donated about 2 % of the profits ( $ 52,000 out of $ 3+ million ) . The book has now made more than double that now according to some sources , and they 'll be receiving royalties from the movie too .

1 I 'm sorry I have a different opinion from yours . Movie was sub par , and do n't live up to the hype .

1 I 'd counter saying that most of the time the best US film ( as picked in the best movie cartegory ) is a drama . So if they only have one category for foreign movies , it 's most likely going to be a drama .

1 I do !

1 It was sad but not tragic . Carl and Elle knew each other for most of their lives and were happy together , really the only truly tragic part was the fact Carl never got the chance to fulfill his promise . I 'm going to cry now .

1 you are not a smart man

1 `` China is * here * , Mister Burton . ''

1 Yeah it 's definitely a `` I saw it when I was younger so I love it '' kind of movie . It does n't age all that well , though it ages the best out of all 3 . The first one you 'll be insanely bored with . The third is kind of goofy IMO . But I love the second one because I used to watch it with my oldest brother when I was a kid . If I was watching it for the first time now , I 'd be in the same boat as you . All that said Fury Road looks like it 's going to be insane amounts of fun and I have n't been this excited for a movie in a long time . I love the theme and settings for these movies though , as unbelievable and stretched as they are .

1 Oh . I like that song actually . [ This is a great rendition of it . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=MKlsUrfbiE0 ) [ I know that it is not a part of Edgar Allan Poe 's works . ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Edgar_Allan_Poe_bibliography ) Even looking at a [ couple of compilations ] ( http : / www.amazon.com / Edgar-Allan-Poe-Library-America / dp / 0940450186 ) of his work . Few of the amazon books list his entire works on their contents though . This [ fanpage ] ( http : / poestories.com / ) also does n't credit him for it . I 'll continue using my google-fu to see if I can find the earliest reference to the poem .

1 Apparently over 600 people are seeing this for the first time , so I think the repost is forgivable .

1 I always loved that movie . Very intense and stressful . Not a perfect movie , but it was very entertaining .

1 That scene was n't in there to show good guys / bad guys , it was to set up the scene for later when the people of that town helped Marcus ; it showed why the people of that town were willing to fight back against the Taliban . They specifically show the kid witnessing the beheading , and he ends up saving Marcus ' life later in the movie .

1 I 'm open to a new Wolverine actor who always wears his costume , Hugh Jackman is starting to get a bit old now and it may be best to start anew .

1 The AV Club refers to a D- as `` The Gentleman 's F '' , the grade is the subject of [ this article ] ( http : / www.avclub.com / articles / gentlemans-f-the-scourge-of-deliberate-mediocrity,91737 / ) which basically says terrible movies which are terrible in a completely bland and expected way are given a D- , while a movie must be terrible in a unique and fascinating way to merit a true F .

1 This topic is very subjective . We do n't really have any notable Horror movies . Well , besides Wolf Creek , I guess . But we also have a lot of fucked up drama movies about Australia , crime , and crazy shit about our country - my favourites : Romper Stomper , Animal Kingdom , Snowtown , Two Hands , Razor Eaters , and Chopper .

1 What movie ? > No Ambiguous Titles We should know the subject of the submission without having to click on the link . Name the movie or actor . Think twice about using the word `` this '' without explaining what it is .

1 What about the argument that people can get the movie-going experience in their homes ? The only benefit the cinemas give us today is that you can see a movie sooner at the theatre than at home . Is that enough to keep us going ? 3D movies were something that you could only get in the theatres , and it attracted more moviegoers . Why ca n't a higher definition of film ?

1 Likewise , I watched it in a 400-level U.S. History course . Film-quality wise , it 's amazing for the time . The content of the film ... not so much .

1 At least it was n't credits .

1 The only real snubs were before the show ; Nolan not getting nominated for Best Director , and Thelma Schoonmaker not getting nominated for Best Editing for Shutter Island . Otherwise , I thought both the nominees and winners this year were well qualified and aptly represented a very good year in film .

1 Cool movie but does n't hold a candle to any of the great Anime that has come out of Japan , or any Kurosawa films .

1 When did Ryan Reynolds play Ben Affleck ?

1 Go back to your bridge , troll .

1 I can understand that , I have a tendency for recognizing faces in film . If he was so well disguised that I did n't recognize him , I would n't be complaining about it .

1 I also do n't understand why this even get talked about . I 'm not saying I would n't like a live-action movie , but the series stands up , even today . It is a great example of something that is much more viable in the animated storytelling medium than live-action just given the setting , e.g. portraying weightlessness or any other number of complex physical aspects of the series , that set it apart from everything else . It does n't need an adaptation for the sake of new eye candy , because it wo n't pull of a better story , and it would be hard to match the appeal of the original without relying on name-brand recognition or rehashed story lines . I 'm not trying to shit on the birthday cake , but no studio will ever put the amount of money up required to do the style of this series and setting proper whilst also making an adventurous departure from the original storyline , let alone adapting that well , while also garnering all-star acting talent to represent the characters we all know and love .

1 Hate to break it to you , but I really do n't think that 's real .

1 Bale was n't the best Batman , but he was a * fantastic * Bruce Wayne .

1 Year One `` merely '' continued DKRs work ; reinventing Batman . But TDKR is undoubtedly the bigger seminal event . It paints a much larger canvas due to the bigger story , had a larger impact on the industry , actually features Bruce as a prominent character and role-player , and most importantly it came first .

1 Wow ... this gave me chills . I loved that they set this in the 1970s ... Martin Scorsese meets Frank Miller , I could n't ask for anything more . I picture him in the red / yellow costume , that would have been the clincher for me .

1 And Skynet . = /

1 It 's ok , I understand . It 's like ogling that hot girl in history class , the one who is so superficial that she looks perfect . You hate her , but you ca n't deny the appeal .

1 Amanda Tapping would probably win this without much competition .

1 He might be the only person that can beat Tom Baker .

1 Dude , I 've never noticed this .

1 Well.. I mean , damn..

1 Yea thats another good point . Peter wants to escape his past of heartbreak , Drax- his family being murdered . Gamora - her past with Thanos

1 This is amazing .

1 Chopping Mall , Aprils Fools , Silent Night Deadly Night , Puppet Masters , Manic Cop , Sleepaway Camp ( or Slumber Camp ) .

There has to be some websites devoted to them to give you a massive list Edit ... here 's a list http : / www.imdb.com / list / ls002593075 /

1 Disney does n't get to keep all of that $ 40 million from China . [ See ] ( http : / www.economist.com / blogs / analects / 2012 / 04 / international-film-industry ) : > China was returning to Hollywood only 13 % to 17 % of the receipts on imported films , a far lower share than the American studios receive from other foreign markets . Going forward China will share up to 25 % of the takings from imports , per an agreement announced during Xi Jinping ? s visit to Los Angeles in February . Disney will maybe get to keep 50 % of the international numbers from other territories . So we 're still only talking around $ 200 million earnings on a film that had a $ 250 million production budget and a further $ 100 million dollar marketing budget . So `` substantial profits '' is pushing it . EDIT : In the long run the film is likely to break even , that 's all , thanks to DVD sales and licensing sales .

1 I get A Christmas Carol and A Christmas Story confused , too .

1 Why did I watch the entire gif ... ?

1 I did n't even realize that . It 's strange that they are n't considered a sibling filmmaking team like the Coen Brothers . They should be called The Brothers Nolan . I like the ring it has .

1 Mightily depressing . At least she can cry all the way to the bank lol

1 I enjoyed Pacific Rim and the 1st Transformers ( even though they 're different ) , but Shia 's character made the Transformer sequels too cringe worthy . How is he still screaming when he knows exactly who these robots are , what they do , how they operate and what happens when they 're around ? Terrible direction of the character . And the 'love interest ' aspect , after the first film , is tiresome . I felt that the first film set up the possibility of sequels nicely , but ultimately they were all terrible .

1 The point of these guys is to try to get people in emotionally charged circumstances ( like funerals ) to over react and attack them or violate their civil rights so they can take them to court for money . That 's what they do , they hustle the first amendment . That 's how they make money . If people would ignore them then these actions would only waste their time and money .

1 Exactly , they do n't have to look the same . It 's `` body double '' not `` face double '' .

1 Yup , which is why he asked Congress for a declaration of war , right ? Go back to your trailer , Teabagger .

1 * best action movie in the last 20 years ? ? ? ? * Well there 's no accounting for taste

1 I have a feeling she does n't know much about life under the Nazis .

1 Yes , but to be honest most people skipped Captain America . Cap 2 has already made almost the same amount as the entire original movie , on almost the same budget and it 's just been released . Consider Thor did better than Cap , but Cap 2 is looking like it could break a billion and Thor 2 only made in the $ 600 's . If Guardians of the Galaxy makes ~2x its budget and establishes its universe as well as Captain America did , then a GotG2 could be as big as the Avengers . No one honestly knows . Marvel just seems to have found a niche in the movie market and is making these relatively upper-middle budget movies that are just phenomenons . Marvel movies seem to have this amazing Return on Investment rate that generally just dwarfs DC 's attempts in the market . The one exception being The Dark Knight and I attribute that 's success entirely to Heath Ledger . Consider pre-tax subsidies Rises cost almost double what Dark Knight did and made essentially the same amount . Consider The Avengers cost almost 2 / 3 ( it actually cost less * before * tax subsidies than Dark Knight Rises did * after * subsidies ) of DKR 's budget and made 50 % more . The Avengers was over double the RoI than DKR . Basically GotG is a complete shot in the dark and if any other company was doing it , I 'd call them fucking retards and ask for $ 10,000 as I 'd likely give them a better return on investment at the dog tracks , and my city does n't even have dog tracks I 'd just spend it and give them a grand back and it would still be a better investment . However I swore Iron Man would be a failure because no one outside of nerds knew anything about Iron Man . They knew Hulk , they knew Spiderman . So yeah . Marvel are complete fucking morons , and somehow GotG is going to make a shit ton of money from people I 'd never expect to watch it .

1 Her voice has a beautiful husky velvety tone and it 's still powerful

1 I have particular love for the Wachowskis , but I really enjoyed Cloud Atlas . Do n't dismiss us all based on them )

1 No .

1 I thought he was making a Memento based joke with that line .

1 I would n't care at all , except your `` original '' link is better quality , so thanks .

1 Kevin Smith 's _Clerks_ if you have n't seen it . If you 've worked in retail , you may like it even more . Might still be streaming on Netflix .

1 Thanks ! That 's going to come in really handy when leaving voicemail for customers at work . `` Sir , this call is to remind you to ... '' `` PAY '' * BRAAAAHH * `` YOUR '' * BRAAAAHH * `` BILLS . '' * BRAAAAAAAAAH *

1 It 'll still be pretty well liked I 'd imagine but it will absolutely lose something a step at home .

1 I think Black Widow would get a pass . She 's trying to hook up Cap in Winter Soldier , she 's got a close friendship with Hawkeye without the film going into romantic territory and in Iron Man 2 she 's willing to use her sexuality as a weapon , just like The Avengers when guys start giving away their plan .

1 My fiancee was turned off from There Will Be Blood the same way . After we saw it in theaters she was astonished that I loved the film so much . Two weeks later she just randomly walked in the room and said `` You know what , now that I think about There Will Be Blood was brilliant . '' Sometimes it takes a while to realize your real feelings for a film . I had a reverse reaction to Juno . First time I saw it I thought ot was brilliant but now each time I watch it just feels worse and worse .

1 He acknowledged that in his quote .

1 I 'm waiting for the director 's cut before my final conclusion about the movie .

1 Had to give people a few second here and there to come up for air : )

1 [ Damnit , I wanted dibs on this one . ] ( http : / 1.bp.blogspot.com / -ycn_PvySig0 / TxbmBFKVPhI / AAAAAAAAAVw / 7Hl6Y0vN-O0 / s1600 / Friday+The+13th+Part+2+3.jpg )

1 I really like Hansel and Gretel as well . It 's definitely not without it 's flaws , but it 's a fun movie if you love campy fantasy .

1 Do n't cite articles you did n't read , champ . Makes you look like a nincompoop .

1 No . Just tell your computer to load up Celery Man .

1 Haha , my mother thought it would be fun to watch Bruno after seeing how successful Borat was . She forced my younger brothers and I to walk out of the theater after the meatspin scene .

1 I had the same problem with Oblivion . But Edge of Tomorrow was actually good . it will wash away the bad taste you have in your mouth from Oblivion .

1 > I have a deep personal hatred for any movie that treats mental illness as a twee problem that can be solved with fun adventures or the right girl . We do n't know that Braff is mentally ill . What we know is that his psychiatrist is * his dad * . His dad who blames him for his mom 's paralysis . The movie makes a specific point of having Braff go to an uninvolved doctor who tells him that he needs a psychiatrist who is n't his dad . And therapy . And maybe drugs , but not in the crazy amounts his dad was prescribing . Garden State does not present psychiatry as the problem . The problem in the movie is a parent projecting guilt onto their child . Psychiatry is just the tool of abuse .

1 try access Fence A A A You did n't say the magic word

1 Hey man , take it easy , no need to get personal like that

1 Yes ! Clever , calculating , and keeps you on your toes until the very end .

1 Probably the best answer , to answer OP . In a couple episodes they mention that there is no hunger , little disease , no need for money , and people can pursue any thing that brings them happiness . I believe they also mention in one episode that there has n't been a murder on earth in over 100 years .

1 Completely different .

1 Upvoted because you 're the only person so far to actually read the question * properly . * Everyone else apparently stopped at the word `` title '' .

1 Just reading that comment makes me want to take a shower ...

1 I know- it 's the perfect alibi , right ?

1 Old Jim Carrey . He 's still physically capable and can use that deadpan delivery when he wants . He can also turn up the weird to 11 when he wants . Full-range actor .

1 There 's no way to describe the impact of those shots through stills . The indoor / outdoor transitions feel like washing your eyes . Great pick .

1 Thatsthejoke.jpeg

1 I 'd probably pay that much to meet Scorsese , but he 's a nice dude I see him charging half price

1 Very true , but damn that 's some good looking cinematography

1 Holy shit

1 a steve jobs movie a day keeps the apple in play

1 I have a feeling especially after this last film most people wo n't be agreeing with you ; )

1 I think he 's content with making bank off silly ads , TV appearances , and minor movie roles .

1 would it cheer you up that 's he 's going to be in the new wes anderson movie ? O_o

1 Lettuce Talk

1 Exactly . It pisses me off to no end when I show this film to other people and their only comment on the dialogue is that it sucks or that the writing is crappy . Well fuck , when you compare it to Aaron Sorkin 's writing or other like material then yea , the characters in Drive are going to look like poorly written buffons . There 's a reason why movies with dialogue modeled after * real-life * are n't typically big films because most audiences ca n't handle it ; they ca n't infer anything without the characters bluntly blurted out their feelings . Ugh. sorry . / rant

1 Maybe that 's a nostalgic `` Pontiac Cafe '' : )

1 I think the spoilers statute of limitations has run there champ . The book is almost 20 years old and the musical is more than 10 years old .

1 That one IS pretty bad , but honestly it sounds like something an actual cop might say in that scene so I let it go on the basis of realism .

1 Char Azznable > The entire Macross franchise

1 Just a couple though .

1 That 's EXACTLY what I came here for . Thank you ( I was 100 % sure it would already have been posted ) .

1 What makes it really awesome is that the entirety of the fight ( minus the obvious CGI stunts ) is Ewan MacGregor and Hayden Christensen actually going at that pace .

1 True that . I 'm just not sure if there 's a movie with that name though

1 Nahhhh

1 Professor XXX .

1 From Verdi 's War Requiem . I 've heard it cited as the loudest unamplified music ever written . In other words , the most metal classical music ever written .

1 The film was barely released . It was on 500 screens vs . 3,000 or so that is typical of a wide release .

1 It 's one of the monsters he 's gon na fight . Since Toho only licensed out Godzilla , Legendary and Gareth created the MUTOs . This is the Flying one .

1 Oddly enough , my opinion of Pok ? mon 2000 has actually * improved * over time . As a kid , I thought it was really slow and dull , especially compared to the first and third movies . Watching it now , it 's still slow , but the story is interesting enough where I do n't mind it as much anymore .

1 I watched it with my wife recently , not as bad ass as it was when i was a kid .

1 Oh , man , I just got done reading Blackout this week . This is just an amazing universe to explore , one of the best zombie apocalypse series I 've read .

1 you guys are friends now !

1 Mr. Whiskers was hilarious . > * `` Devil 's Advo-cat '' * His lines were amazing .

1 I 'm 27 . And nearly married .

1 Something like `` Why are you letting him lick you like that ? So gross ! '' Also , it 's not just a duck , it 's [ Howard the Duck ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Howard_the_Duck ) .

1 The remake proves what happens if you diarrhoea all over a film reel then cram it into a projector .

1 > Then there could be another alternate universe , where everybody on Reddit was super excited about the sequle . Then when the post saying `` 300 sequel flops '' goes up , everybody is shocked and disappointed because they all really liked the movie and did n't think it got the recognition it deserved . This would be the same universe in which Dredd 3D was a box office smash that reddit derides for being `` Batman with guns '' , while Avatar was a commercial failure that later developed a small but devoted cult following after it was released on DVD .

1 I have n't seen the movie but this is just parroting South Park . Distasteful parroting too , like when people squawk that `` fag '' is n't offensive to anyone anymore because of that one South Park episode with the bikers .

1 Funny Games is the best one on the list . That movie was uncomfortable to watch the entire time . It really messed me up after watching . I think it is the only one to really affect me .

1 I somewhat agree with you , since I was let down by the movie too . But to be honest , if you chose not to finish the movie then I do n't think you have the right to voice your opinion about the movie in its entirety . You could say something like , `` From what I saw of it , that movie was terrible . '' But for all you know , the ending was absolutely amazing and redeemed the whole thing ( not true in this case , but you would n't know since you did n't finish the movie anyway ) .

1 That was a solid movie up until the elevator scene , then it became perfection .

1 well moron good for happy gilMOMYGOD

1 Nope , most people know him from Shindler 's List .

1 I once filmed the ceiling in my bathroom for five hours . Twenty minutes into playback , I confirmed my suspicions ... I am a genius .

1 Saw it last month . Could be the comedy of the year , it 's that funny .

1 My mom taped the movie for me on our vcr. Watched it then and a few months ago , loved it.. Good stuff !

1 No , Spaiht is fine . Lindeloff ruined it .

1 Very much so .

1 pool gene ?

1 I believe the film is in the works , directed by Cary Fukunaga of True Detective fame .

1 That , my friend , is a very uplifting and relevant analogy . Looking back , I remember when I first read Neuromancer , I kept thinking `` wow , this world is so much like blade runner , '' but not in a bad way , in fact I thought the similarities really added to it because it provided my mind with an anchor for visualizing the story . So I guess it 's not the worst thing in the world to have comparisons drawn to a similar story that preceded it . I guess in the end , quality reigns supreme .

1 I had no clue that was the same guy . Mind = Blown

1 IMO the limited technology is what makes the movie stand out . When you make everything slick and cool it loses all of its charm .

1 It became a sexual joke after the book , not the other way around

1 [ King Shark ] ( http : / static.comicvine.com / uploads / original / 1 / 15659 / 2121057-king_shark_secret_six_25.jpg ) is a must and maybe [ Captain Boomerang ] ( http : / img2.wikia.nocookie.net / __cb20121012113958 / marvel_dc / images / a / ac / Captain_Boomerang_0014.jpg ) .

1 The Cannes reactions to it are n't kind ...

1 Fuck yeah . Precious is in it .

1 I made the pasta dish he prepared in the beginning , it 's great .

1 Hey just because someone likes the movie , and so does the majority of others , does n't make it a circle jerk ... People are really getting ridiculous with that term . A circle jerk is when there is a long thread of people almost repeating each other ... Just sharing the same point of view does not a circle-jerk make .

1 how is Ultraviolet not on that list ? ?

1 Black Swan gave Natalie Portman Best Actress , got several nominations , and made back over twenty times its budget ?

1 You 're willing to guarantee it ? Well , I feel pretty confident now .

1 I would say Paul Thomas Anderson could 've produced an interesting result .

1 Eva Green . B ? r ? nice Marlohe . Sophie Marceau . Jane Seymour . Hell , what about Judi Dench ? Daniel Craig , Timothy Dalton , Roger Moore ... Christopher Lee , Javier Bardem . I mean come on , there 's so many choices ...

1 Like All-Father like son .

1 Cars are to blame , roof is too low to wear a hat while driving , unlike in public transport .

1 Well , basically , we work on animation . There are modelers that would model the rope . There are people who do the lighting to make the rope look nice , there are coders / render wranglers / compositers / etc . that does n't take too long . It 's just a rope , does n't take a year to make a nice rope . We animators use the characters that the modellers created and the riggers set up to be able to animate ( rigging is making the controls and deformations of the geometry mesh ) . Then animators manipulate those controls . It does take a long time to work on animation . Breaking down the poses , getting them just right and working on the inbetween frames . Working the `` squash and stretch '' and timing and whatnot . There 's a lot more too it , but it 's late . Maybe that does n't exactly answer your question . I only just graduated from a course in university on animation and have n't actually worked in a studio yet .

1 You are an angry man .

1 * Thank you * for continuing to make movies that entertain me !

1 Damn dude , I bet it took at least 15 floppies to hold all that . Hopefully you did n't have to overwrite your registered Doom floppies .

1 Ebert 's review claimed it was a fascist celebration of violence . This is like saying Nabokov was singing the praises of pedophilia in Lolita , or that Harry Potter is a satanist tract . It 's possible to miss the point .

1 Same here . The thumbnail of the Jerry Maguire kid with muscles looked really weird and I thought this was going to be a /r/wtf x-post .

1 [ Simulacra and Simulation ! ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Simulacra_and_Simulation )

1 Confirmed ! According to the [ Los Angeles County Assessor ] ( http : / assessor.lacounty.gov / extranet / guides / realprop.aspx ) and the [ Los Angeles County Treasurer and Tax Collector ] ( https : / vcheck.ttc.lacounty.gov / index.php ) , his property on the corner of Capri and Romany is worth $ 20,756,130 and the property tax due yearly is $ 253,921.94 . This exceeds the US median income of $ 51,939 by a considerable margin .

1 He just shows that realization that he is gon na die so well .

1 KAAAHHHHNNNNN ! ! ! ! !

1 I guess the jokes went over your head . Nothing goes over my head . My reflexes are too fast .

1 Exactly . It is n't about * equal * , it is about * fair * . You do n't erase years of inequality by simply pretending it never existed .

1 They did not hire an actress based on talent , but on the size of her lips .

1 hey at least it was n't another `` it was all in her head , she 's the only real one ' or `` from point x it was all just a dream '' that every other movie 's fan theories end up being .

1 perhaps it was only meant for Weyland , since Vickers knew that he was on board to begin with .

1 I think it 's probably more likely the FF are in another dimension / fighting some aliens somewhere etc . They are n't really street level heroes at all .

1 Piper 's character was someone Joe was crushing seriously hard on but he had to be told that it was just her job . And of course her kid may have been the rainmaker . Finally we see how far Old Joe is willing to go . So yeah her role was needed . Yeah Tk is explained at the start and shows up for the rest of the film . It 's a big old `` That 's important later '' . The ability really does result in a super person .

1 Praying With Anger was n't anything special compared to Unbreakable and Sixth Sense .

1 We all have those days , here take a soma friend : )

1 That one got me too . Also the `` broken down piece of meat '' scene .

1 you have exceptional taste : )

1 I 'm glad they did n't remove the weirdness that was present in the original movies .

1 No .

1 That movie is a fucking masterpiece . I will shank anyone who says otherwise . Also yes `` To the Stars '' is IMO one of the best pieces of music to ever accompany a movie .

1 I 've seen it 3 times . The first I was n't sure about it . The second time I realized how self-indulgent it was and the third time I hated how such an artfully done film ( cinematography , the gore effects , some of the music ) could amount to such drivel .

1 That 's really nice to hear . He always comes off sounding arrogant in threads like these but I hear only good things from the people who worked with him .

1 I once lmade my friend watch it while I was unpacking in the other room and made him tell me what was happening .

1 I have n't thought about that movie in forever , but I remember really enjoying it . Props

1 Marvel-Disney can definitely push boundaries as well , just look at The Winter Soldier . It has the same level of serious tones that the X-Men franchise does . I mean , it did n't have large robots literally murdering characters left and right , but it 's definitely not a kid-friendly flick .

1 Well , maybe , but sometimes it 's refreshing to hear the weight of someone 's stance bluntly , I wish more people would get angry and swear like that before giving their reasoning .

1 You mean Owen Harper from Torchwood .

1 He did 2 and 3 . Doug Liman did the original .

1 Ha ! Yeah , I watched this when i was around eight or ten years old . I did n't really think about any of the Nazi symbolism back then , it was just cool to me that magic stuff was fighting tanks .

1 Was it denied ? I did n't see that , not that I believe it 's happening but I did n't see that it was outright denied as false

1 till September

1 Yup , I love Identity , John Cusack is pretty awesome in most things .

1 That 'll do , bitties . That 'll do .

1 > Christopher Nolan

1 He made me laugh a lot in that movie . Not directed at him ( or mentally challenged people ) but more like the way you laugh when a kid does something cute . I love that movie , 90 % because of his performance .

1 My friend asked me the same thing after the movie . You see , Cid never meets Joe or the Gat Men in the first time line . So as Cid grows up , he never fully trusts Sara ( the only person he ever sees growing up ) . He then becomes a warped adult with powerful TK . With the intervention of Joe in the second timeline , Cid is able to see how genuine Sara 's love for him is , due to all the danger they endure together . Cid could only be good after the first timeline .

1 That is true . I was watching the BrBa finale * alone * and I instintively clapped in what I think it is the same scene you 're talking about .

1 U and we . Uwe . You and Uwe .

1 A huge fan of huge fans ?

1 Yeah it was fantastic . Improved upon the original across the board and gave it an actual narrative , something which the original lacked . They also managed to string together many action sequences to keep the action flowing really well . Sound track is amazing , especially during the [ car case scene ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=R8wEoaq3Ok0 & list=PLsWUUEC9KpqEfYBwZ-KcvGx7GFxRxiyly & index=17 ) and the [ kitchen fight . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Exqq_S8iLKs & index=23 & list=PLsWUUEC9KpqEfYBwZ-KcvGx7GFxRxiyly ) Nicolas Winding Refn , the director from Drive / Only God Forgives uses a similar way of shooting to create the dark atmosphere exceptionally well .

1 I read he actually has trouble spelling and forming proper sentences . Does n't stop him though , amazing .

1 This . In the comics , Superman often has clear limits to his strength , speed , etc . It 's the movies and the old , old comics where he was completely invincible . For a good Superman film , we need to see lots of pain and suffering for our hero , struggling with his limits because he ca n't save everyone . If you are familiar with Doctor Who , that sort of struggle and loneliness .

1 I think it 's been great year for blockbusters , majority of the summer releases were good . Much better than last year .

1 Rian Johnson ! He rocks . He 's making 8 and maybe making 9 , but odds are the torch will be passed to someone else .

1 You 're not wrong . It 's your opinion . We all have different ones .

1 Kinda agree .

1 The Linda Vista [ is being turned into senior condos ] ( http : / la.curbed.com / archives / 2011 / 12 / senior_project_for_creepy_linda_vista_hospital.php ) . Those poor old people are gon na be haaunnnteddd .

1 Well , grasshopper , the path to happiness has 100 but steps . Step two is learning the difference between `` your '' and `` you 're '' .

1 Hey now , Jurassic Park kind of set the bar back then . They put a ton of work into it because shit like that had n't been done before . That being said , there really is n't an excuse for bad CG , either go all in or do n't do it at all .

1 Manhunter , Silence of the Lambs , Red Dragon , Hannibal

1 Those acts always make me simultaneously marvel at what humans can achieve and loathe my own lazy ass .

1 % 90 of the movie is the diary . If your explanation is that one scene is not the truth , then there 's equally valid basis that all the other scenes are `` made up '' as well . And if that 's true , then any theory could be true , ie none of the movie happened , they werent actually magicians , it was all a dream etc . See my point ?

1 To be fair , Pulp Fiction is n't everyone 's cup of tea .

1 Tarantino doing Twelve Angry Men

1 The script at this point is a 750 page tome by Benjamin Button writer Eric Roth . Hardly a rock solid starting point . Plus Maleficent was sold on the back of Sleeping Beauty and Disney 's marketing machine . It could have been Rachel Weisz IS Maleficent and done similar numbers .

1 The `` NO . You move '' speech is a thing of beauty . It 's up there with the Braveheart and Independence Day speeches

1 False . Just did .

1 I was totally freaking out until I read your comment , so thank you .

1 This seems like such a template on all bands , software products , phones and basically any product or service .. first put them in high pedestal , then trash them as they start minting money and `` sellout '' or go for the masses , then the inevitable hate leads to some decline in sales and then `` tehir latest ... is actually very good '' .. this template has gotten so repetitive or boring that is pretty much a sales model now .

1 I had to send in my sarcasm detector for a tune up , so you 've fucking stumped me buddy .

1 Oh , I did n't know that . Thanks for letting me know !

1 The Emmys are on the tv season calendar , they 're in September and judge things from previous September to the summer . And since breaking bad season 5 was broken up into two years every single award it won this year it 'll win again next year

1 Generally ... no . This is surprisingly bad .

1 I thought the same thing . : (

1 This is the only movie I 've waked out on . I knew nothing about the source material but the ads looked interesting . I made it almost an hour in but I felt myself just thinking `` why am I watching this ? '' However because I walked out of this movie I walked into Timecrimes so I do thank it for that .

1 sex . lots of it .

1 That was n't Wasp . That was a character called Angel they yoinked from the New X-Men .

1 You should have tried harder .

1 Disappointed !

1 Nah , looks like they just brought the hairline down and did some color / contrast work on it . I 'd imagine this is done because , if you look at the original she 's clearly wearing a wig . Easier to morph an old-person-wig into old-person-hair with cgi , than trying to morph young-person-hair into old-person-hair

1 Yeah , but is it based in Boston ?

1 VALHALLA !

1 `` You know I like my dessert first . Now gim me the veggies . ''

1 I read the comics and I loved the movie . I have no idea why some many people hated it .

1 Im sure you are a much better actor than all of those people who get million dollar movie deals for acting .

1 `` No more pull ups ! '' That line is seared into my brain .

1 Its all about the artist . I believe this one is ~~tom whalen~~ . his style was great for steamboat willie , but i want a fan of the rest . Olly moss , Ken Taylor , and aaron horkey do really fantastic work . Edit : It 's made by [ Johnny Eveson ] ( http : / expressobeans.com / public / detail.php / 154940 )

1 It honestly does n't look that bad : http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? feature=player_detailpage & v=y0Vhhkus9fU # t=51s

1 That was very special .

1 The Blob !

1 Yeah `` mutations '' as defined by Xmen only occur in humans with the x-gene .

1 `` We wanted to expand the universe and we felt the fan favourite raptors were the perfect characters to open up the world . Who would n't want to see Raptor Cops managing Jurassic World after hours ! ''

1 Budget cuts . > * If I can not wear a $ 900 tie , I will wear no tie at all ! * ^ ( -Bob Iger )

1 That escalated quickly & # 3232 ; _ & # 3232 ;

1 I disagree . I think a comment that just criticizes another comment and adds nothing to the point of the post being made are terrible . There 's a downvote button for a reason . Now all our comments are terrible .

1 It is sad to see someone who is beyond competent at something that can effect us die . And labels like 'junkie ' are slurs . Just shorthand for 'I do n't need to even try to feel like they are my equal and their failures give me right to ignore their right to compassion ' I know from personal experience that heroin makes you do things you think are bad and tests every limit of your personal experience with shame to confront or avert pain or difficulty . That is the nature of heroin and , in their unique ways , other vices in the way they act on a person . Saying that a person should n't be called a junkie on the laurels they have earned professionally encourages the illusion that some 'tortured artists ' have ratified use and degradation through caustic drugs by virtue of their artistic contributions to society . 'Junkie ' is a slur that serves the same purpose as 'murderer ' mostly indicates the unacceptable behavior of taking another 's life based on your singular judgement of their lack of a right to live . Trying to remove slurs that describe sick behavior does more harm than the use of those same slurs . I quit doing a lot of hard drugs a long time ago and I was able to quit because of the hell that being a 'junkie ' entails . And the people who wanted to put on the waterworks and say how it is justified because of X , or Z did nothing but feed the delusions that allowed me to refuse to man up and create a life which causes happiness rather than shoe horn it in through massively harmful lifestyles and drugs . Damn right he was a junkie and never listen to someone who says `` Most of the time that `` junkie '' is just someone depressed that uses drugs to dull the pain . The drugs just make life bearable for some people so they do n't have to deal with any of it anymore . '' You do n't get a moral pass to poison yourself because you feel bad . And you do n't get to jump hurdles at others expense to feel better at other 's expense . TL ; DR You seem to have gotten a part of the wisdom on labels that I had to indulge and grow out of drug addiction to realize . Hooray .

1 He said summer , not all time .

1 Pokemon ?

1 Holy snit

1 I give you , the iDinosaur .

1 > I think the people who will be most upset by VII will be EU Damn Europeans ! Get over it , already !

1 That movie did leave a lot out , but it would have been impossible to do a lot of what was great about the graphic novel . But doing the squid would n't have worked without explaining the disappearances of artists ? I believe . That would have added 30~ minutes to an already super long movie .

1 I have a feeling I 'm becoming old when I seriously ca n't stand movies that glamorize not growing up .

1 Well , I had my bag of `` crazy '' for today .

1 Starring a bunch of MMA fighters and Lou Ferrigno . Holy shit .

1 Along the same lines ... How did 2084 win three awards , if it was never made ? ?

1 while he 's got the jason statham thing going on really strong , I also bet he could pull of a Woody Harrelson .

1 If you have n't been keeping up : ignoring them has been common practice for a few years now . They make a fair share just on settlements .

1 Raiders of the lost ark , casino Royale , inglourious Basterds , evil dead II , and goodfellas are usually at the top of my list

1 Mmmhmm .

1 Who cares its $ 45 million dollars for him to pick up a drink and take a sip . At least it is something people actually do , he is n't driving and flipping a Heineken truck , or beating someone to death with a keg of it . Not to mention he still drinks his martini that people seem desperate to see , so in no way is his signature drink being usurped .

1 Hawkeye was going to be in it , but Renner had scheduling conflicts actually .

1 I ai n't givin ' you no tree fiddy god damn loch ness monsta !

1 Whew talk about dodging a bullet . ... you know if he was going to appear in it his son would have been in it as well an his daughter on the soundtrack

1 Wow , I just remembered him saying his mother ( Sarah 's sister ) died because he `` was n't strong enough '' and got chills .

1 Oy , that movie is fucking glorious .

1 It 's not as bad as Brian Cox . Go back and look at the IMDB of some of your favorite movies he 's in fucking everything . o.O

1 The fact that Goyer is still on board should worry everyone who has a stake in this film or is hoping for something remotely good .

1 Everything is crazy in that film !

1 Take notes , Hollywood .

1 I think it 's on the list though . A couple of the movies listed are a bit random .

1 Can you be a bit more constructive ? Personally I loved it . Horror movies do n't have to have jump scares and the usual stuff to be scary or `` good '' . This one surprised me .

1 You think Thanos would be impressed ? He believes that Earth is easily conquerable .

1 No that is just a group he created in partnership with a Canadian distribution company . View Askew 's next project is Clerks 3 .

1 I 'd have to say that or Boogie Nights . Love Dr. Strangelove .

1 [ This ] ( http : / www.merriam-webster.com / dictionary / joke ) will explain * everything * .

1 I thought it was funny too . Still incredibly fucking annoyed haha

1 Damn it Chloe !

1 Mark Ruffalo Is the best actor to play Bruce Banner yet .

1 `` A sense of anticipation '' is a great way to describe watching LOST

1 It was very of its time . The internet was pretty new , and Anime was just being introduced to Western mainstream audiences . I think it was one of the first widely-praised Anime movies ( since Akira ) to get a limited theatrical release in North America ( and it did , despite what the wiki says ) . I remember seeing it when it came out and , quite frankly , after seeing stuff like Akira , Ninja Scroll , and all releases that U.S. Manga Corps were putting out ( in the new `` Japanimation '' sections that video store chains were adding ) it really did n't hold up .

1 5th for Disney is bad .

1 It 's really , really funny . And has boobs in it .

1 I loved the footage of the real characters at the end and you realise that bale was doing a pretty spot on impression .

1 That pivotal scene in the middle , ... I thought RW deserved an oscar nomination for it , at least if you could give awards for short clips in the middle of films . I do n't remember any other movie scene that 's been so emotionally powerful for me .

1 The problem is that Book 1 and Book 2 are full of fantasy and tropes . Then book 3 steers down a totally different path .

1 Maybe they should have used it .

1 Seems as though most people think `` but that 'll never happen to * me * `` when they 're young . Until it does . : (

1 Aye , but people had to manually do it . It 's called Rotoscoping and basically comes down to animation . Just a technicality though : ]

1 I would n't say it 's a `` pee your pants '' comedy , but the black humor and political satire is perfect .

1 I felt exactly the same way . I literally just watched the movie and wanted to PUNT the shit out of that bastard . What a fucking retard .

1 Annnnnnnnnd this is why they have post-production sound in movies ... lol . But now I wo n't be able to get that line out of my head .

1 This guy gets it .

1 I think Thorin got a full face prosthetic . The only one not to wear one was Kili I think ( the designated sexy dwarf )

1 > I agree , that 's not what the light discs look like . [ Wrong . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / jGXRz.png )

1 Big Trouble in Little China .

1 It 's not that they do n't expect it , it 's that they do n't want to have to watch it at all .

1 The husband in The Seventh Continent ( 1989 ) The mom in Nobody Knows ( 2005 ) The boyfriend in Like Someone in Love ( 2012 ) The Second Mistress and the husband in Raise the Red Lantern ( 1991 )

1 I 've never seen this gif before but I absolutely love it .

1 Then let me say this again , why say comic books are for kids if you still pay a ticket to watch a comic book movie ? Without comic books , you would n't even have Batman or Superman on the big screen

1 meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous meticulous

1 The only reason I was upset about Idris Elba as Heimdall is because Marvel totally blew their load early with that casting . Elba is too good an actor to waste on a minor supporting character .

1 What a great score ! I 've never seen this film quite like this . It really is fantastic .

1 You should check him out as Dr. Watson in Sherlock .

1 Haha , well , it 's not my fault she 's so photogenic . But in all seriousness . I did n't really think of who she was when I took those screencaps ( I 'm not good with celebrity names ) . I just thought those scenes deserved a screencap .

1 [ NO ! ] ( http : / gifs.gifbin.com / 092009 / 1253886001_office-no.gif )

1 And no Chuck Norris to censor everyone 's speech ! Hooray for fuck words !

1 That whole movie had lots of random , awkward stuff in it . I was pretty disappointed .

1 There is a spot in the original Bambi where it skips straight from him being young to being a young adult , Bambi 2 is inbetween those two points .

1 Pretty and pretty bad .

1 The sidekicks Danny Glover and Sam Jackson would be amazing as well .

1 Bought a keyboard and a power outlet and parts for a computer to say this .

1 Curse you Michael Bay ! ! ! ! ! ( or Roland Emerich or whoever started this whole thing )

1 Steve Jablonsky is awesome . The soundtrack is probably the best thing about those films , that and the CG .

1 I really dig the Romeo and Juliet that Baz Luhrman did . After that , the Much Ado About Nothing with Keneth Branagh

1 Yeah good point , I guess I forgot about those scenes - and BTW I 'm checking out Visions of Light right now , looks interesting . I would say The Fall is definitely the cinematography study film I 'll do , I also wanted Koyaanisqatsi . I forgot about that one .

1 Judging by how good the recent Star Trek film was I think its in safe hands .

1 I think Harold and Maude is bittersweet . Borderline happy even .

1 Just saw it for the first time . Holy fuck that 's creepy .

1 Or watching the movie instead of browsing reddit while it 's on in the background .

1 Andrew Garfield was brilliant in it . It was a great movie .

1 Yeah , ironic to say this on a thread for such a high concept film , but in recent years the concept has been more important than the content and an excuse to do cool things . Here , there is a high concept , but it appears to service the story .

1 In the end we 're all just another burned out hulk on the side of the road .

1 I do n't think you understand . In Vietnam his job was to dispose of enemy personnel . To kill ! Period ! Win by attrition . Well , Rambo was the best .

1 Yes but that format is a bit different . The intro tells you what the subject is , the body has all the details , and the conclusion recaps the most salient points . And the abstract contains a one or two sentence version if each .

1 it was just really disappointing . pixar is notorious for excellent animated movies.. cars could never compare to toy story or monsters inc.. and a sequel was entirely unnecessary..

1 dude would make a great [ Jay Garrick ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Flash_ % 28Jay_Garrick % 29 ) or [ Alan Scott ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Alan_Scott )

1 Dude has what many would argue as a legitimate beef with DC comics , the studio that helped make him famous and that he helped reinvigorate during the British Invasion of the 80s . He refuses to take part of anything DC does anymore because of this and say what you will , he does n't falter . You can call Zack Snyder a hero for adapting the man 's work , but you spit on the one who created the thing your hero reproduced .

1 That 's what LOTR did . Plenty of SFX throughout the series -- obviously necessary in some cases . But it was generally used in background or wide shots . When the focus was on an orc , it was a physically present orc .

1 Plebers gon na pleb pleb pleb pleb pleb *

1 It has been a thing this whole time . It was rebooted in New 52 but not `` revived '' .

1 But the new pricing plans is now for two separate companies . This article is n't about the new pricing plan ( and although I understand it , I still think it was n't the smartest move they could have done , they lost at least 8 bucks from me because I had the blu-ray option ) . Be that as it may , if I wanted to be with two different companies , streaming and dvd 's from separate companies , I would go with Blockbuster.com who at least gives you coupons for stuff . In fact , I still may ...

1 Just saw Collateral last night for the first time after Stuckmann recommended it earlier this week . Damn good movie . The club scene was really good .

1 That depends on what kind of dialogue they cooked up in that writers room .

1 No man , check the front page of r / movies , they have pulled the film entirely . Press release came out like an hour ago .

1 If you are in to manga , and you may or may not be , Vinland Saga takes place during this time period and while the main character is not Canute it takes place during his conquest of England and I find it enjoyable . On the topic of the thread I wonder if [ Tsutomu Yamaguchi 's ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Tsutomu_Yamaguchi ) would make a good movie . The wiki seems sparse but the free idea of surviving both atomic blasts just blows my mind .

1 Whos life time some people only live a year

1 > no big stars

1 `` Sick '' ? Clearly you have n't worked with school children .

1 Never get on a starship that looks like HR Giger made it . Other than that , almost everyone behaves rationally and tries to solve it , and they still lose . And I love Baby Bear flying back to the ship ? he 's a total badass , and then ? aw .

1 no he did n't .

1 Equilbrium : )

1 oh I know just throwing in some of my personal experience to go with your comment .

1 Hope so . Maybe his death was staged so no one would come looking for him and he could live with Bruce and Alfred secretly .

1 Forever forever forever ... ... .

1 Wow ; you actually think Travis Bickle is a `` hero '' ? ( One of the main points of the movie was that people who * think * like this -- i.e. , the people behind the Vietnam War , of which Travis was a veteran ) are dangerous , crazy , pathetic , and emotionally fucked-up ... people who only end up doing `` good '' by accident , and who actually just contribute more to the world of moral relativism and `` vigilantism '' ( i.e. -- the `` world police , '' those who write their own laws ) . If * that 's * what you 're saying all modern superheros owe their `` origin '' to ... well , that 's actually arguable . But it says we 're an utterly insane country if this is both true and `` desirable . '' ( And -- EDIT -- if this is your point , would n't Charles Bronson 's character in * Death Wish * supersede in the superhero world ? )

1 Earlier drafts of the scripts showed the whole story of Peter 's parents . It showed what their whole mission was and how they truly died because of Norman Osborn .

1 Sure -- just ask the chair .

1 Good point ! And yeah , I 'm not much of a TV / movie geek , but it seems like they are the two lessor actors , though I could be wrong and like you said it 's the poor writing for them .

1 How dare you

1 I 'm not your uncle !

1 `` I 'm going to count to three , there will not be a four . ''

1 sounds like a callback to the last shot of Goodfellas with Joe Pesci shooting at the camera , which itself is a callback to a silent film with a Cowboy shooting at the screen . Perhaps I 'm just making excuses for Scorsese though .

1 Man I 'd just suck his dick . Fuck getting shot over some dick sucking . In fact , they do n't even need a gun , I 'll suck it just because , where ur dick at man

1 You have to look for the number of seeders available and the seeder / leecher ratio . If you found a .torrent file , it does not guarantee a speedy download . Also , a lot depends if DHT has been enabled or disabled on the torrent .

1 I heard a lot of good stuff about Big Fan and it still surprised me as a very good movie . Bill Murray balances perfectly between the comedic and dramatic in Lost in Translation . It really is my favorite movie .

1 Yeah , the biggest red flag for bullshit to me was the fact that she 's worried about living `` paycheck to paycheck '' but gives up on a $ 56,000 a year job because they wo n't let her post about their company on her personal social media ? She 's either HUGELY misrepresenting the issue , or the dumbest person to ever work in a movie theater .

1 Well , if you had no rules , accountability or scruples id imagine being a cop would be an insane amount of fun .

1 I would n't really call Memento 's opening a strong beginning . It 's my favorite movie , and it does n't take away from it , but the beginning , while `` rewound , '' is n't really that special .

1 If the Bond films are ever released straight-to-DVD , I 'm sure Statham will get a shot .

1 The person he replied to specifically asked about the cinematics from the game

1 The scene between Kym and her mom in Rachel Getting Married .

1 One-eyed Willie would have suffered from some variant of anophthalmia . Usually it 's just a totally absent eye , but in theory the development could have resulted in bone instead of an eye . Exceedingly rare .

1 hey , dont be ungrateful .

1 That 's not soon enough .

1 > GOD HIMSELF HAS BLESSED ME WITH MANY GIFTS , ONE OF WHICH IS KNOCKING SOMEONE THE FUCK OUT I really enjoyed Pain and Gain

1 cool

1 TIL Aquaman is a fucking badass .

1 Yeah , it all connects if you 've seen the film . If you have n't , then it does n't really make much sense .

1 That 's kind of the point . The movie wants you to feel the same way the characters do . A lot of people just get annoyed when they 're supposed to get that way .

1 Fireball ? It 's all the rage with the kids right now

1 Personally , I 'd choose Groundhog Day . But I 'm a bit biased since it 's one of my favorite movies , and I live in Philly so I 'm inundated with Rocky references on a consistent basis .

1 > Why does a drug made to suppress the X-gene let Charles walk ? It 's not the same drug . It 's based off the drug that suppresses the X-gene . > In the comic , someone else sends her back , a mutant with time powers This time Kitty is the one with time powers . Your problem is that it contradicts the comic ? What is hand waved ? It makes zero difference . > And lastly , The Magneto Problem . How are we supposed to take Magneto seriously as a villain , when he 's always right ? That 's what makes him a compelling villain . He 's not a 2-dimensional caricature . > Why would Mystique 's DNA allow trask to create Robots with the power to adapt to different elements and such ? That makes no sense . You might as well ask how can Mystique change into other people ? That makes no sense . She had something in her DNA that was the key to morphing molecules . Do you really need more than that ? Did you want a power point assisted lecture or something ? Your argument boils down to it being different from the comic and things you failed to notice .

1 I had to sing this to myself a couple of times before I could remember where that 's from .

1 0 / 10 needs more troll lessons

1 I know you 're being sarcastic but that 's still a completely inappropriate thing to say .

1 intentional cameos are almost cheating . and if you 're gon na use smallville , you should totally use : * character : * lana lang * played by : * annette o'toole ( superman 2 ) and kristin kreuk * both in : * smallville

1 That 's so insensitive . They should really consider changing the sound to something softer . I mean , ambulances , firetrucks and police cars might get stuck in traffic and people might die , but at least it would n't remind young american jews of movies they 've seen about the holocaust .

1 People are FUNDING a project and receiving clear and specific benefits , not buying EQUITY . Crowdfunding is illegal and therefore not possible with a website like kickstarter . It appears that you are one of the great stupid unwashed since you do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about .

1 Well , the sequels were n't that good , but the first one only * seems * a typical 80 's B-movie on the face ; that 's sort of how Paul Verhoeven works . It is actually pretty clever cultural criticism with a fancy stylish action / sci-fi coat , sort of how * Starship Troopers * is actually a lot more interesting on some deeper levels beyond the absurd superficial story and action . I mean , its not * subtle * , but I still think the original * RoboCop * is a pretty amazing film that works on several levels . The sequels were pretty trashy , but part 2 was the kind of trash I can get into ( plus , as a youngster I enjoyed the rare sight of a movie willing to kill a kid ; it is grating , as a child , to never feel any dramatic tension for the safety of kids my own age in films ) .

1 Why are you defending it ? You keep blabbering on to everyone else that its just a joke . Suddenly you have a point to make ?

1 I think it actually ironically fits the themes of the book .

1 Good or bad , I 'd have loved to see it

1 To be fair , he took a great story , put it in a top animation studio , and flush it down the toilet .

1 you 'll be disappointed but you wo n't hate him for it .

1 I watched Electroma just because Daft Punk made it .

1 Loved the soundtrack from Maniac , so 80s

1 The point is that people make movies or write books or whatever all the time and do n't think about it , and they fail to pass the bechdel test . That means the way they think at a basic level is biased . The only way to correct biased thinking is to consciously try to do so , thus measures like the bechdel test . It 's fine for people to just write the story they want to write . But if the majority of stories people `` just want to write '' do n't pass the bechdel test , I do n't understand how you ca n't see the problem .

1 You are correct . I swapped it for The Iron Giant . I do n't know why I had it in my head that he made Up .

1 Have you seen the musical ? Being pretty should n't be a problem at all in this case .

1 I think we should all have a talk about the definition of profit .

1 Well we saw how good his chin could act in Dredd

1 That 's the , uhh , that 's the joke .

1 His skin is clean within seconds ? There 's obviously a reel missing

1 Man Brett Ratner confuses me so much ... . He makes such great movies and at the same time makes such schlock .

1 got 30 minutes in and was instantly hooked

1 Yeah sorry . Great as in a great look at him . As far as I know , he 's only been glimpsed in the trailer beforehand .

1 It 's in the city of Petaluma , CA , up a hill at the end of English street . ( Kind of a steep hike , not sure how they got all that camera equipment up there . ) They also filmed the scene where Ben floats outside Lori Swenson 's window , and where the ship crashes and sinks into the water at the end .

1 > someone Drew Struzan

1 FUCK YOU MAN I HAVENT EVEN WATCHED STAR TREK YET

1 Not that you 're wrong about Fincher , but he is n't exactly a new filmmaker . He 's been directing great movies since the early 90s .

1 Probably . If this does n't move you then I do n't know what can . Seeing all the pain these families had to go through and still go through does n't just move me , it makes me angry . Maybe it will take the death of one of your loved ones from a texting while driving accident to `` move '' and `` touch '' you .

1 A war between superheroes .

1 I think it 's mostly because he confirmed it .

1 Right Said Thread

1 because shia the beef ruins everything .

1 Orson Welles . The Kenai Polynesian Helicopter Tours promotional video .

1 Yes ! That was one of my first memories of getting actual goosebumps from a movie scene ! This opener is seriously one of the best openers . It 's not grandiose like Saving Private Ryan , but it 's definitely a `` grab em by the throat and do n't let go '' sort of opener !

1 I had no idea what to expect and was wine drunk . That movie gave me a crazy mindfuck . But yeah , no RfaD .

1 `` My turn . ''

1 I still remember those silk sheets ...

1 * You fucking bitch *

1 She 's 6 . We started her young though so many of these movies she 's seen multiple times . And I still have to cover her eyes for some scenes .

1 Great track . I like this jazzier , laid back track a little better though : http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=B9wbumIKJJ0

1 Yes you are ...

1 Mumblecore is a recent film movement that features simple interpersonal stories , amateur or non-actors , basic camera movements , and natural / improvisational dialogue . Some of the big names in the mumblecore movement are Lynn Shelton , the Duplass Brothers and Joe Swanberg . Some of the better mumblecore films are : * The Puffy Chair * Nights and Weekends * Frances Ha * Humpday * Tiny Furniture * Your Sister 's Sister * Drinking Buddies

1 I sort of thought this as well . It seems almost like he was intentionally fucking with him . I believe he even smiles himself after Graysmith leaves the house , in a way akin to him thinking `` what a dumbass '' .

1 Would n't `` Bruce the Liar '' have been more obvious ?

1 Yes ! When the White Stripes Song came on especially . And the leap..ouch .

1 Supermaaaaaaan

1 His chickean rosters chain is quite delicious you fool !

1 It 's not that bad . It 's not that good either mind you . But it 's only like an hour so it 's not hard to watch . It has a couple really solid scenes but over all it 's fairly ordinary with nothing sticking out about it . Fear and Desire is what it 's called btw .

1 It was shown in limited release in LA , just a few months ago . If you keep up with their Facebook or Twitter page , they usually throw updates on there . If it goes well at Cannes , who knows maybe Lionsgate or even WB could pick it up , which would be crazy good .

1 I was thinking the same thing ! As an Iowan , Field of Dreams is a movie that makes me have great pride for my state .

1 They had a pretty difficult relationship . During Spartacus , Kirk Douglas was very involved in fighting the Hollywood blacklist , while Kubrick did not want to be involved . This caused a lot of friction between the two considering they were both sharing the public eye . His comments on Paths of Glory are funny because here he points out that Kubrick , against 'better judgement ' , had changed the screenplay to make it more commercial . But then he goes on to say that it ended up bombing in the box office but being a critical success , like Kirk had so brilliantly predicted , is n't that the opposite of commerciality ?

1 English speaking history appeals more to English speaking people . Maybe if New Amsterdam had not fallen then maybe things would have been different ... ... ... ... probably not as no one gave a crap in that city who was in charge just as long as they got to make money .

1 It 's annoyin ? .

1 He was pretty good in 17 Again as well , which put paid to all the wankers who made tedious jokes about him starring in a remake of Back to the Future - that film was very close in spirit to BttF , and he was great fun .

1 At the very least , it was an excuse for a stealth pun . That and Muntz designed a ridiculous amount of technology for the dogs to use . It does n't seem much more ridiculous that he adapted planes for canine use than anything else the dogs got up to , like cooking or talking .

1 I think The Brothers Bloom is a lot like a Wes Anderson movie so try that out

1 It was the DVD release ( special or deluxe edition ? something like that ) . I have both the VHS and the DVD . VHS has the cover that you 're comment refers to and the DVD has the image from OP .

1 Watch c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tatooine Gate .

1 I have just seen it now and like PoopMcgibben 's comment , it 's bang on the money .

1 Once The Hobbit is finished completely 3 Avatar films will begin filming in New Zealand back to back to back for releases in 2015 '17 and '19 I believe .

1 Found the [ video ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=DPt-4Nwght0 ) . If I recall , Hitch said it was the only time he ever had an intentional innuendo like that ...

1 Looks like it . He did the artwork for another [ Star Wars poster ] ( http : / www.cinemasterpieces.com / 72013 / chayfeb13.jpg ) before the film was released , along with artwork for the comic book .

1 Star Wars is my favourite movie franchise , but they could 've done so much more with Luke . The `` temptation of the dark side '' stuff in * Jedi * could have been awesome , but they did n't delve too much into that . I guess they wanted to keep it kid friendly .

1 I fucking hate all Wes Anderson movies .

1 You sound like you 're in 8th grade ...

1 No matter how successful you ever become , you 'll forever be the guy who was so insecure that he felt the need to brag about his income because someone made an offhand joke about his movie-viewing habits .

1 Oh god for a second I thought it said yolosite.com .

1 Yes .

1 He did n't say it 's a Pixar misstep . Read the title again .

1 Either way the final scenes are in thr beginning .

1 Its just a cool movie.. Maggie Gyllenhaal was awesome in it too

1 The best point is the one asking if they saw the movie . I was a bit on edge immediately when the bad guy was named Lord Business , but the movie simply did not use that premise as some sort of shot at business . The movie was full of making fun of movie conventions ( like ... CEO bad guys , perhaps ? ) and besides , the name Lord Business in the movie we learn came from the kid 's mouth . That makes a ton of sense , because even absent any thematic reasoning , tons of kids hate business . They see it as taking their parents away . So it 's entirely reasonable for a child to call a bad guy Lord Business , especially when his dad was running the toys like a business . Even if we forget that , you ca n't ignore that the movie ends up resolved with the use of Lord Business 's techniques . Merging creativity and instructions together into a greater whole seems to help both sides . If we 're going to read anything in that , it 's an endorsement of a certain type of capitalism , one that I bet works really well for a toy company like lego , where on the business end , they need plenty of creativity .

1 Yeah , Tarantino has said that Django and Hildy supposed to be Shaft 's great great ( great ? ) grandparents .

1 Logans Run .

1 No need for the attitude ; my bad .

1 because it was ...

1 Agreed , but long before that directors stopped wanting him for roles because of his lousy attitude on set . Have you read his blade trinity story ? He tried to beat up the director .

1 Because she 's his wife and he wants to include her in important aspects of his life . That 's not hard to understand .

1 > I absolutely enjoyed the first movie I agree

1 i found bully a lot easier to stomach than kids

1 Came here to say that . I still love those trailers where they make it look like a documentary / newstory with all those interviews . Also , the print work looked pretty 'official ' too .

1 Time Warner is not going to use Joss Whedon 's script . TW already rejected his take of the character and are not going back to it because he 's available .

1 You thought a movie called `` Precious : Based on the Novel 'Push ' by Sapphire '' was a horror ?

1 In the case of `` Frozen '' , it 's hard to market something that is n't completed , initial trailers showed scenes from an earlier version of `` Frozen '' where Elsa was still an evil character . Five months before release , in July , they were still fighting amongst themselves on whether or not to have the `` Do You Wan na Build a Snowman '' segment pulled from the movie , and `` Frozen '' was n't in final form until about three months before it 's release after marketing was well under way . There may have been some genius in there but there was also a lot of dumb luck .

1 Such a good little movie Did n't have the ending you 'd expect .

1 But the originals relied mostly on physical effects ( or whatever its called when you use prosthetics and makeup and stuff ) and had only a few scenes with CGI that would be impossible to use physical effects for , ie . huge battle scenes . The Hobbit had hardly any physical effects and was all CGI . I mean seriously the last fight in the movie had what , like 15 bad guys in it ? You cant tell me they couldnt afford to not use CGI in that part . It really just seems like laziness to me .

1 And then you will know where they got a number of things in The Matrix from . GiTS was a major influence on that film .

1 Out-skiing a man-made avalanche .

1 I did that too . I was like `` * BULLSHIT * that 's totally Cars ! ''

1 No , ad blocker FTW . : D

1 You just saw a great movie ... now go see it again .

1 that meant actual harry wasnt actually harry

1 And no , Neil Peart stands alone .

1 Everybody get up , it 's time to slam now .

1 Sucks that the movie and book shared the same name but it was pretty well known before the movie was released that their similarities ended there . Went in prepared for just some random high budget zombie flick and came out satisfied .

1 Kurt Cobain . [ FTFY ]

1 Hey , got me to finally buy Kick-Ass . Now switch ... TO KRYPTONIIIIIIIIIITE !

1 Well that 's a completely unfounded and unreasonable assumption .

1 That 's correct .

1 Nicolas Cage-The Wicker Man

1 Agreed , SLP was a great movie but that first trailer felt so derivative that it took me forever to actually see the movie .

1 Sounds like Don LaFontaine .

1 [ Yep ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Snow_Buddies # Controversy ) .

1 Wait , are you saying this about Drive of Fast and the Furious ? Because it only applies to the later .

1 I agree . Completely unnessecary and , even taking the movies ' nature into account , really bad taste .

1 They get huge tax breaks filming in Canada and Toronto is a great city to make it look like any other big city . For example , Pixels was filmed here last summer , plenty of other big blockbusters were also filmed here .

1 Really good movie . Watched it for the first time during the winter holiday .

1 Clearly she has access to Zemeckis 's time machine .

1 At least it means more than IMDB ... 9.6 ... fucking lol .

1 To be fair , they 're rushing here so fast to post this , that they 're overlooking the fact that the top post on reddit right now , sitting at +9k , is exactly what they came to post .

1 I totally agree with you about Bruce Campbell . I love him in a lot of stuff , but this is NOT the right role for him .

1 I would say it adds to the ridiculousness of the situation .

1 It 's not an enjoyable movie for me to watch . It 's not funny , I do n't care about the characters , it 's just gloomy scene after gloomy scene . Overall it comes off as a movie that thinks it 's better than it is .

1 it was tough , but a couple oscars put that issue to bed .

1 As if the Star Wars brand has ever been kept sacred . There 's been thousands of toys , hundreds of books , dozens of video games , and several cartoons . And this is n't just recent , its been like that since the Star Wars first came out .

1 Hopefully they made another good villain

1 To each their own , I truly enjoyed everything about it .

1 I would n't be surprised if they added the ending after reviews from early test screenings . Thus the `` theatrical release . '' Curious to see if they have any alternate endings on the dvds / blurays .

1 I think it 's a mix of getting high and something you do before you 'transcend ' .

1 Justice League Dark is a group allied with the original Justice League that is composed of and deals with supernatural beings . It is not a `` dark and gritty '' Justice League .

1 In Casino Royale , Bond broke into her flat , discovers her real name and says something along the lines of `` I thought M was just a codename , I did n't think it actually mean anything . '' I just took it as meaning that her name began with an M and it was a coincidence , not that the Powers That Be in government deliberately appointed people who 's name began with M as head of M16 because it was convenient . Obviously , it would cut down on the cost of ordering stationary , but there would n't be much more benefit than that .

1 The Dark Knight ? One of the greatest ever ? Watch more movies , man .

1 Martial scenes in Bourne movies were extremely well done .

1 fake downvote to oblivion to thee !

1 Hey wait for a late show so you do n't scar a theaterful of children . On second thought , have fun .

1 No , they do n't . There can NEVER be enough hate for Twilight .

1 I enjoyed that twist , just to let you know .

1 www.imdb.com / title / tt0425326 / Outsourced

1 I actually find the final ending way cooler . Just two people talking at a table by the backyard . It 's so scaled down compared to everything before it in the film , and the fight is so simple . It 's a great contrast to the rest of the film .

1 pony is the most sexual song ever written

1 I think Del Toro just produced it . Although I do agree it was pretty disappointing .

1 DAE 90 's kid ! !

1 > its a movie not a vegetable.. it doesnt become bad just because its a few weeks old . Firstly , it 's a big advertising ploy . If it makes enough money in the first weekend and appears to be on track to make the studio its money back , then they can double down and advertise more , this time with the tag line 'the number one comedy in America . It 's like a virtual word of mouth . Even if no one you know has seen it , it 's what everyone is talking about and that 's proven , `` empirically , '' by the box office numbers . Your point about Superman is another good one . If the theater realizes that there 's little chance for a down film to rebound , it may double down on more popular showings by decreasing the amount of times a day Superman plays as its revenue is tied to ticket-sales . Of course , low-box office numbers can also be a positive thing for those $ 1 and $ 2 per-ticket theaters as they may get them sooner . So , I think that you 're right . Box-office numbers are for studios more than for audiences . That said , it 's also a designator of some importance insofar as a film almost has to bomb in a theater in order to later be considered a cult-classic , and I do n't doubt that for some fans , the fact that it bombed at a national scale provides extra enjoyment since it is accompanied with a sense of satisfaction that you 've got good taste ... but there are going to be people who get enjoyment from that idea in most realms of entertainment and it would be unfair to extend that to all fans of cult-status media .

1 I know a lot of people who love this movie . This has to be near the top of all time guilty pleasures .

1 So you 're white then ?

1 And Boyhood was a film about a boyhood that played out like a boyhood .

1 Yeah , there should have been a top spinning on the table , too .

1 Just because Cap destroyed SHIELD and The Hellicarriers and gave all their info to the public doesnt mean EVERYTHING is OK . In fact it might get worse , HYDRA is like a virus throughout the world and also ULTRON may use the transparency to hurt The Avengers .

1 Not trying to act smart , considering I just said something that was also as simple as you thought it was . What I basically said was : he 's a good director , makes pretty things , likes robots . In no way did I make that any more complex than grade school level .

1 I mean , once you 're comparing films of this magnitude it all comes down to personal preference . A lot of people preferred the realistic and sonewhat darkly humorous world of Lester Burnham and the colorful cast and tale of rebirth and beauty that came with it . I loved Being John Malkovich but that movie is a little more abstract and plays more like a critique on the job of an actor than a relatable tale for us all to learn from . More people vibed with American Beauty is the short answer . You did n't , which is fine . I loved it , that movie actually sparked my interest in film .

1 From whom I learned the word Quim

1 We did a discussion on O Brother in a classics seminar I took and the general consensus was that they had in fact read it , but said they had n't to make the movie more accessible . Then the prof pointed out that both Coen brothers went to Bard College , where Homer would be a required reading . I saw the movie before having read Homer and loved it , then again after and realized that there 's another level to it , so I 'm OK with them claiming that .

Also just looking through your comments you really do look like you enjoy condescending and picking apart peoples opinions , so please , do n't get angry over little stuff like this . : )

1 Song 1 : Get Up Offa That Thing- James Brown Song 2 : Burial- Yogi feat . Pusha T .

1 This . I do n't understand the mediocre status . It was a Nolan story by ( hack or not ) talented Zack Snyder . I 'm excited to see a JL film set in this universe .

1 I realize that . The point I 'm trying to make is that it 's stupid to say , '' Hey this actor was met with criticism when they were cast and was great in the movie . So therefore EVERY left-field casting decision will be great ! '' . George Clooney is a great actor , but just is n't Batman , in the same way that Jesse Eisenberg can be a great actor , but could be a bad fit for Lex Luthor .

1 Before the aliens ?

1 I believe he said `` some unexplained explosion '' or words to that effect . I do not recall . Since we `` witnessed '' the event ( we see Cage dead , and some kind of white light fluid creeping up his face ) , we are left to assume he gets some super-powers . But I like your idea of Omega leaving the army behind and moving to another timeline / planet .

1 Before those wins it was 7 nominations , just because you win two , does n't mean the nominations do n't count .

1 And a ginger !

1 I recall tits but no full frontal ?

1 Yeah . He opened the first battle he was in as a member of the British elite expeditionary forces by sniping the German commander in the neck with a barbed arrow . Guy had the only confirmed bow kills of ANYONE during the war . The German soldiers around the officer must have shit themselves lol . One of his greatest moments was in a battle over an island in the Adriatic Sea . Him and 43 other commandos led an assault on the German position at the center of the island on a hill . Only him and 6 other men reached the objective and then a mortar shell killed all his comrades . After using all the arrows and munitions he had left , he played `` Will Ye Not Come Back Again ? '' on his bagpipes until a German grenade knocked him out . That 's when he was taken to the concentration camp ( after being interrogated in Berlin ) , which he escaped from , was then recaptured after almost making it to the coast 70 miles away , and then slipped away from his new prison when the Germans abandoned it after hearing the Americans were approaching . Then he hiked over 90 miles before meeting up with an American army column . He was on his way to Asia to help us fight the Japanese when the war ended , and by all accounts he was super bummed out about it . He then served in the Middle East , saved tons of people , and became a surf border in his retirement .

1 I truly loathe her character . She was on the verge of okay for the first one , then got progressively more irritating as the series progressed . A pet theory of mine is that her role could have been played by a pigeon for better comedic effect .

1 The extras , obviously .

1 And there they go .

1 I 'll second these two . If you want a more bleak interpretation of similar themes , see [ Melancholia ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1527186 / ) . I 'd also highly recommend Tarkovsky 's [ Stalker ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0079944 / ) for a heady , existential ( or perhaps merely philosophical ) film .

1 I 'm pretty sure that was more about the Agents being undefeatable killing machines .

1 It 's a private site . If you want free speech go make your own site .

1 Same here . It 's really just a great piece of filmmaking . Every shot is perfect , all the actors play their characters perfectly , the script is amazing , and the direction is just flawless . A masterpiece imo .

1 I 've got ta say I do n't agree with you about Roberts being a bad actor . Watch him in Runaway Train , he 's great in it . He does , however , do a * lot * of garbage .

1 Well , no . His name was Berg .

1 Moon was incredible , One of my top scifi movies .

1 Thanks : ) She 's the one who introduced me to more classic movies ( Doctor Zhivago , Taxi Driver , Vertigo , etc . )

1 No . Studios are businesses . They answer to boards of directors and shareholders . If a movie does poorly , that reflects poorly on the people who made it . However , if they can use the leak as a scapegoat , now they can say , `` The movie would have done much better if it had n't been leaked . Its not our fault '' .

1 Yes , the radiation damage could be cured . The data that had been transferred to his brain could not be extracted without killing him , however .

1 Now he can see how Sopranos ended .

1 How was that not a spoiler ?

1 It would help also its super fucking awesome so , yes , you should watch it before the second one .

1 there are much better pg-13 movies out there , why do people always use that as some prime example

1 Perhaps , but I respect him in EVERY other aspect . And if anyone can teach that kid humility , it 's Jackie Chan .

1 The lego games lately have been top notch , good fun .

1 Whoever it was , he made a great decision , I loved that movie .

1 Please do n't take this the wrong way , but that post is something a fat chick would write .

1 Go watch the trailer at 1080p on the Apple trailers site and at the 44 mark with the chair look behind the `` s '' in Prometheus ; )

1 I still miss Donnie Yen

1 Oh those crazy brits . That had me in stitches . STITCHES I TELL YOU !

1 They all have a tape in them . But not the one that 's on the cover .

1 I 'm sure they 'll fit in a cameo .

1 Oh man ! My illusions are being burned in front of my eyes . Actually , it is pretty neat .

1 He will be in the film but he isnt part of the Squad .

1 I like how they have n't entirely dropped simple teaser posters . [ This is for the live-action Cinderella ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / NW7jpON.jpg ) and [ Frozen 's was this . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / 8f6bNUl.jpg )

1 Wow , I know what you 're talking about but I ca n't think of it either .

1 The correct response was `` Yeah ! '' . I was shocked this was n't somewhere else in there , especially with the mentions in the article of the Movie Jennifer Lawrence is in town for is Mockingjay .

1 * pushes glasses up * well actually Wheedon was actually the writer on Alien Reaurrection , William Gibson did a treatment on Alien3 .

1 The cost of an evening showing of * Twilight , * including Snacks and Parking : $ 25 . The cost of a marked-down 2-disc copy of * Twilight * : 96-cents . The cost of an not doing well in school English Studies when you 're trying to be snarky : Priceless .

1 I fucking love the shot near the beginning where he snorts the cocaine and the camera follows his head up . Also just generally a good movie - glad I did n't see trailers first though and had no expectations . It does slow down in the middle .

1 Popular among fans but more casual viewers could see it as ridiculous and sink the more serious tone of the film . You can picture the `` Giant Moth ... quick turn out the lights ! '' comments . It would be like trying to get Mr Mypzpkt or how ever you spell it from the Superman comics into the film , or Fing Fang Foom into an Iron Man film .

1 You sound really angry at me . But thanks for taking time out of your busy masturbation schedule to reply so often . You want a tissue ?

1 Sorry , I wasnt clear , I meant the look etc of it ( since we 're kind of talking cinematography n stuff ) I sent you a pm

1 That 's pretty much what Disney 's Dinosaur was . Okay , it was n't technically live-action , but it was meant to look that way . Hell , it went as far as to end it with the friggin ' Great Valley .

1 i always love this scene The Bridge of Death https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=dPOyOM7wxlE

1 I got chills reading this .

1 Once for me too . NEVER AGAIN .

1 I loved the novel and , if I remember correctly , the author had a great deal of input on the script -- especially for such low budget far . Working with what they had available , I think the film was a resounding success , especially the audio mixing .

1 In Norwegian it 's called `` Kalde Rumper '' ( `` Cold Butts '' ) .

1 Jesus relax . Most people have * just now * learned about the guy .

1 I always thought Dr. Doom should sound like Bela Lugosi ... when I was a kid reading the FF comics in the '60 's , that was the voice I always heard in my head for him .

1 I like how the director cast a crappy actress whom he wanted to bone as Dagny Taggart . John Galt would have cast a crappy actress whom he wanted to bone as Dagny Taggart .

1 He 's in tonnes of stuff .

1 FUCK YOU

1 Agree . I 'm a Batman fan first , Superman fan second , but do n't name the Man of Steel sequel that , for the love of god .

1 Why did n't you like it ?

1 Shit , yeah .

1 I think of it as a sequel with a flashback tie in throughout . Not as much a prequel but dueling timelines that jump from past to present and present to past . But I could see calling it a prequel of sorts too .

1 I like this one .

1 Wow . Worst studio decision of 1999 ? ( And just as bad as how Warner Brothers fumbled LA Confidential 2 years before . )

1 Shrek is life

1 Interstellar - when returning to the ship and 24 years had passed - catching up on all those video messages .

1 Other than Wreck-it Ralph , it was the best animated movie I saw last year .

1 I am so happy because as i saw the last stand all i could think was man i wish singer could finish the trilogy the way he wanted . Now look at it , not exactly what i wanted , but it sounds like they are going to retcon last stand out of existence . Only worry is that this movie is going to be too big , and nothing will get enough screen time . Dreams can come true kids .

1 Yeah I met him once in California with my stepdad . The guy was ridiculously nice even for actors . Such a shame . I wish his family the best .

1 Really ? I find that hard to believe , it 's a pretty transparent movie ...

1 Yea , he was alive . It did n't , immediately , kill him . But , fuck was that brutal .

1 EAT THE TURKEY

1 Life goes on ... until it does n't . I agree 100 % with your take but I think it also dealt a lot with corruption and misogyny in our society . That 's the thing I love about Kubrick movies , there are so many layers .

1 Literally everything that Marty 's going through is so unbelievable that it could cause a nervous breakdown . Seeing a younger version of his grandfather is relatively down the list . But Marty 's a cool dude . He takes all this in stride .

1 i know ! the funny thing is , i 've loved til schweiger since this movie and a german film called `` what to do in case of fire , '' so when i saw him in `` inglorious basterds , '' i was the only person to cheer..haha

1 Yep you 're right about Guardians . But we did n't * know * that we 'd seen a clear representation of what the movie would be like until after it came out and we * actually saw it * . > Are you seriously telling me you can not make any sort of judgement on how a film is going to be based on this ? You can make a very likely prediction . You can not actually do the rating before you 've seen it .

1 The Selina Kyle that they portrayed was from Batman Year One . She 's not her lover but rather a prot ? g ? . Like Robin is to Batman .

1 Um , really ? ? First , you have to recognize the skill the actor had in his portrayal of the joker wether you like the movie or not . Secondly , are you really suggesting that this psycho murderer should have that kind of power to wipe away what Heath ledger did as the joker ? What a foolish comment .

1 Could n't agree more . Really dissapointed with the film .

1 Dude , you do n't know what Eiffel towering is ? So you get a girl and two dudes . One is banging her doggy style , the other is getting his dick sucked . They both think it 's awesome and totally not gay , so they double high five . A high ten , if you will . That 's the Eiffel tower .

1 Penelope

1 That does n't sound like a ruined experience .

1 I watch plenty of movies ( I am a film student after all ) and I thought this was a modern masterpiece .

1 Well , enough time has to pass in order to make it iconic . Otherwise it could considered a fad line just because it currently popular .

1 Bob from * What About Bob ? *

1 Did you know that if you say `` My Cocaine '' it 's like your are saying `` Michael Caine '' in Michael Caine 's voice .

1 Lois was underutilized and used incorrectly when used . Then I 'm supposed to believe the kiss at the end .

1 I absolutely loved the movie but no I ca n't say the 3d added anything

1 Like they said in the youtube comments : `` Back in the day when being ? a bad ass did n't get you fired '' . Edit : thanks for the vid !

1 Awesome post ! Lana Del Rey 's song for * The Great Gatsby * is amazing on the VFX reel .

1 Wow . Can you say in-depth ?

1 I remember people of a certain ideological persuasion talking about how `` problematic '' Secretary was , in 2002 . They came up with all sorts of idiotic reasons why it was `` misogynist '' etc . One I remember the most was how showing her bent over , with him standing beside her - no I 'm not kidding - `` turned her into a penis , '' thus depriving her of her womanhood . Virtually every woman I know who saw the film loved it . Haters can eat a bag of dicks .

1 A pretty famous comedian here in the UK , he ( along with many others ) helped to bring Alternative Comedy to the mainstream . The Young Ones , Bottom , some cameos in Blackadder , Drop Dead Fred , the voice acting in Hogs of War , just to name a few .

1 I said Ghibli because that 's where this art is from .

1 It was n't a great film . However , Johnny Depp did a bang-up job as a psycho CIA agent .

1 You should read the post by / u / itsmissjenna . Do n't base your opinion solely on a biased film . Do some research .

1 He was so perfect as the Riddler it seemed like the entire film was from his bat-shit insane perspective . Schumacher could 've just made it revolve around Jim Carrey more since he is pretty much the only actor that could carry Schumachers vision ( if you want to even call it that ) forward .

1 It 's like Stan Lee for Marvel films , you can always expect Bruce if it 's a Sam Raimi film . So his 3 Spider-man films intersected these cameos , haha .

1 Bullshit title , no one forget anything , it 's just the Fall .

1 The difference with this fourth movie is that it 's hitting the right notes in terms of nostalgia , they 're bringing back the park , and not only that , it 's a fully functioning park that 's up and running . That alone has me excited , maybe the story will be cheesy , maybe the dialogue will suck , maybe the direction will be sloppy ... But the premise at least has me thrilled , so I personally can not wait to see it .

1 Come on , we 're not drawn to this movie because of the plot twists , we 're here to see some mind blowingly bad ass fighting .

1 Shit , if the clout of David Fincher ca n't get it made , there 's no hope for it , is there ?

1 Have you even read the parental guide ? ? _ ?

1 I was thinking about posting a similar reply . I think it would work - and then watch it again with eyes open ?

1 Nope . Norwegian .

1 The Big Night with Stanley Tucci is incredible . Also , Ratatouille .

1 `` You know what you see if you look up a definition of idiot ? '' `` A picture of me ? '' `` No , a definition of idiot , which you fucking are . ''

1 Thank you . For it 's time Waterworld is n't a bad action movie . The same with The Rocketeer and The Shadow . Both those movies get so much unwarranted criticism .

1 The Director 's Cut is out though . It 's fantastic !

1 And his stuff before . Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands come to mind here .

1 I feel like both Thor and the Vision kind of disappeared / were n't accounted for for annoying sections of the final battle .

1 Because by stating how much I hate something I declare to the world how superior my tastes are .

1 Maybe 12 / 10 lol

1 he is really underrated as an non comedic actor

1 Could n't wait the 1 / 2 hr til the 2D started ?

1 Or , that the Academy has a different opinion than you a lot .

1 I like most Lars Von Trier movies , but this is far and away the best film he has made . It is excruciating but there is something very darkly beautiful about the experience of the film , not necessarily the film itself . I would recommend you watch at least once . Bjork is unbelievable .

1 Got to kidsinmind . Google it . It tells you all the sex stuff in the movie . The are full frontals in the movie

1 Exactly this . The Honorary Oscar is supposed to be awarded to achievements that do n't fit into regular categories . It has instead become a lifetime achievement award . Not only that but * where the fuck * is the Special Achievement Award ? The last thing to get it was Toy Story in 1995 . Serkis should 've been given one of the two for Lord of the Rings . Zoe Saldana should 've gotten one for Avatar . A few voice performances should 've been awarded ( although they are eligible for regular acting categories and are n't helped out by animators . )

1 Classy .

1 There 's a huge story about it . It is part of the Ghost Tours in Key West . Well , one of the more famous ! They very much , butter it up . But the picture does n't do it justice ! So it 's a little bit of both . I was younger though , when i saw it .

1 Do you even lift bro ?

1 > Fucking Boyhood . Is this a rule 34 thing ? If so what airline ?

1 The `` p '' is silent .

1 Best part is the troll in the comments . 7 / 10

1 That 's more like the Venture Bros

1 State and Main was a great movie that he was in as well .

1 Out of all the nominees that year , The Pianist was most deserving of the Best Picture Oscar in my opinion . I just hold my Lord of the Rings films in high favour . Sorry for the misleading wording

1 Yes . That is why I picked them .

1 Honestly he 's awesome in Seven Psychopaths and In Bruges . You should give them a shot but if not that 's cool too

1 I had never screamed at a movie until I saw Wait Until Dark .

1 I do n't see how most of those are underrated .

1 He 's fantastic . It 's his best performance ever .

1 I hope you are wrong but fear you are right .

1 I agree 100 % that Renner would not be anywhere near as good as Joaquin . But saying that he would NOT have been good in The Master period , is nonsense . The guy knows how to act , he 's just been making shitty career choices as of recent . To add to the trivia : James Franco was initially considered to play Freddie Quell . But Paul Thomas Anderson did n't cast him because he was n't `` [ scared enough . ] ( http : / www.cinemablend.com / new / James-Franco-Explains-Why-He-Didn-t-Get-Joaquin-Phoenix-Role-Master-33725.html ) '' Now imagine what a train wreck that would have been . Not saying he 's a terrible actor , but he 's not right for the part . Also ! Joaquin Phoenix & Jeremy Renner are in a movie together , called [ Lowlife ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1951181 / ? ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) . Set to be released later this year .

1 The Batman universe equivalent of Godzilla 's son is probably the Bat-Nipples .

1 Its crazy to me that Zimmer and Nolan come together at least a year before they start shooting . I love that Nolan had the idea of this soundtrack on his computer while he was writing and shooting the film . You can tell that they go hand in hand .

1 No he 's just special

1 For 1 , I do n't think they show films they have available on DVD / BluRay only if you are only subscribed to the Instant Queue plan ( at least this is what I 've gathered since I 'm Instant Queue only , but you can find some of the DVD / BluRay only films if you search their site not logged in ) . Second , your 4 star rating of Dark side of the Moon worries me ...

1 complex

1 1080p .

1 The parts with James Gandolfini seemed improvised , I do n't believe anyone could write so poorly . The movie as a whole just dragged on and on , it was only an hour and a half long and felt like 3+ hours . The preview makes it seem somewhat amusing , the only funny scenes are in the preview . The characters are n't likable or dislikable , I could not have cared less about any of their fates . It is fucking awful .

1 Maybe , who knows . I mean he was pretty old compared to her , but I would n't really rule anything out .

1 Guy Pearce is one of those actors that is criminally underrated . Brilliant guy

1 Such an amazing movie . I strongly recommend it .

1 This . Still gets me every time . Vangelis score gives me goosebumps .

1 John Goodman is amazing with the Coen brothers ...

1 He did n't write the movie , he was just in it .

1 Password protected ? Are they afraid people would steal it ?

1 Scott Pilgrim is likely going to be a famous cult film .

1 Because the coverage will be ubiquitous and unescapable .

1 They 're shooting a sequel now and the ending certainly feels like you 're waiting for the next film . I did n't mind it that much but its definitely not satisfying .

1 I was thinking this whole trailer looked like Tumblr personified .

1 Yeah !

1 I wanted to hunt you down and punch you for about 2 seconds of my life .

1 I made these in 2011 .

1 I just watched it again today to see if it was as bad as people remember it . It really was okay . The baby godzilla scenes went on way too long , but the first half was n't too bad . It is definitely not the worst Godzilla film . Hell , it is n't even the least faithful godzilla film .

1 Gordon has both .

1 Bunny Lake Is Missing [ ( 1965 ) ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0058997 / ? ref_=nv_sr_1 ) by Otto Preminger . This is the one to watch but also consider the following . The Lady Vanishes ( 1938 ) by Alfred Hitchcock Phantom Lady ( 1944 ) Frantic ( 1988 ) Harrison Ford Breakdown ( 1997 ) Kurt Russell Flightplan ( 2005 ) Jodie Foster Changeling ( 2008 ) Angelina Jolie

1 Never would have thought he was such a wacky guy .

1 Duuuuuuude . Unreal nostalgia feels from that . I wore out that VHS when I was a kid .

1 Yes , its my favorite Sigourney Weaver scene ... [ LINK ] ( http : / 25.media.tumblr.com / 82c2a6a1f03ec6c2c41342c849901c25 / tumblr_mrwn1kP0Fv1rj28rmo1_500.jpg )

1 The love interest was directly important to the lead characters development though . He lived an entire life not being able to relate to women or find love to that point , partly because he was abandoned and was a product of the world that the love interest came from . All of those lost man children that fed a thriving organized crime sector . She decided to break the cycle in her own way by giving that life up and returning to care for her son . And , well , JGL 's character grew from that in his own way and broke a different cycle .

1 > ... men who were enjoying fun and sex while he was ? rotting in loneliness ? ? might easily have been mistaken for a scene from one of the movies Rodger ? s father , Peter Rodger , worked on as a director and cinematographer . > How many students watch outsized frat-boy fantasies like ? Neighbors ? and feel , as Rodger did , unjustly shut out of college life that should be full of ? sex and fun and pleasure ? ? How many men , raised on a steady diet of Judd Apatow comedies in which the shlubby arrested adolescent always gets the girl , find that those happy endings constantly elude them and conclude , ? It ? s not fair ? ? > ... but it ? s worth examining who gets to be represented on screen , and how . It makes sense to ask , as cartoonist Alison Bechdel does in her eponymous Bechdel Test , whether a movie features ( 1 ) at least two named female characters who ( 2 ) talk to each other about ( 3 ) something besides a man . I actually do think the Bechdel Test is an interesting thing to talk about specific movies about , but I do n't think representation of women in movies had anything to do with Elliot Rodger . The dude was ill .

1 Literally everyone agrees Keanu was awful in Dracula .

1 Maybe , wait no , definitely , he 'd still be legally responsible in any event .

1 great example , it 's not easy to make an existential comedy work , but that film nailed it .

1 NOW I HAVE YOUR IDENTITY

1 Yep .

1 I liked it ! I very much prefer Repo ! The Genetic Opera , but I still like Repo Men

1 Wait , that came out * last year * ? ? ? Holy shit I remember it being advertised and thought it was n't out yet !

1 > 21 Summer Movies We 're Dying to See > 21 ~~Summer~~ Movies ~~We 're Dying to See~~

1 That sounds way better than any version of the movie .

1 The Hoppening - A rogue Brewmaster is ruining all of the towns beers . `` The beer , it 's too hoppy , Nooooooooooooooooooooooo ! ''

1 Actually , a boycott like this could cripple any 'good ' the industry produces , as anyone willing to get behind it are educated , intelligent people who usually go to GOOD MOVIES . Which means those movies will make even less , which encourages the industry to churn out more crap . There has to be another way .

1 Pei Mai taught her well

1 I really enjoyed it . It 's a cute film and orientates itself around music , I love music . From what I 've grasped a lot of people just think it 's overated and are a bit bitter for some reason . It got global attention which is n't that common for Irish film .

1 It was very clearly established that Jedi fought in the Original Trilogy , they were never monks .

1 Vatos Locos forever !

1 Because Tyler is n't really there .

1 In my opinion it was well worth it . While not extra heavy on plot , it does make a fairly complex weaving of it , and not once did i question what the characters were doing . There was no disconnect moment where i wanted to shout at the characters `` You 're doing it wrong ! '' . It just made sense and was a smooth , entertaining ride .

1 Edgar Wright - Antman

1 they do n't need to tell the entire saga . can just do `` man fights a horrible war ''

1 I felt the different tones of the film blended well .

1 Nope , I downmodded you because you called me an idiot . Not only you are violating the [ reddiquette ] ( http : / www.reddit.com / help / reddiquette ) , you are also abusing the Report feature . I 've been very polite and tried to exchange ideas with you but you 're apparently too close-minded to discuss about something you like from another perspective . I 'm pretty sure the mods will do the right thing .

1 I already did [ The Doctor ] ( http : / imgur.com / ukNCZun ) .

1 High Rise is really more a dystopia of the mind . Nothing overtly science fictional occurs . It 's much more closely related to Lord of the Flies .

1 Fodi , short for Fodi-mote .

1 Lebowski : Orgins

1 I always use the trailer for The Matrix as the best example of how you build interest in a movie without giving anything important away . It was a brilliant campaign for a movie that fortunately backed it up .

1 That 's not Ripley .

1 Not so aloud , it 's the only unblocked trailer site I can watch in my work .

1 Came here hoping I was n't the only one !

1 It 'll be interesting to see where the monsters from Pacific Rim fit in .

1 /r/hailcorporate

1 he was at a convention ... .i was n't on the street like a random fan , I waited in line for a hour for him .

1 I usually lose the shoes .

1 You 're really stretching it with Star Wars 4-6 , and Batman vs . Superman comes out in 2016 .

1 Absolutely NO ONE is saying this film changed things . They 're just calling it a great movie , which it is . Just because a film does n't change the way you look at the world does n't mean it is n't amazing .

1 Well , they are showing the lead character on the promotional material . He 's just not the focus point of the poster . The marketing department in charge overseeing the Italian release obviously think Brad Pitt and , to a lesser extent , Michael Fassbender will put more Italian asses in seats . The article is misleading . They do n't ignore Eijifor . But the article even admits that `` Other marketing materials for the film , which is translated to 12 Anni Schiavo for Italian audiences , do feature Ejiofor more prominently . ''

1 It 's on Amazon streaming .

1 I just wanted him to say 'sometimes , you have to take a step back to go forward . '

1 I wish this was not true ... but it is . source ; bitter fucking experience .

1 `` NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ''

1 I 'm guessing milk was a bad choice

1 He actually used to live rough and train-hop ( i think thats the term ) from state to state while listening to punk rock . He believes in Anarchism etc so it 's his own way of social rebellion . If you get famous because of it all the power to you .

1 His T-shirt makes the whole thing really confusing .

1 The international part .

1 yeah the first superman movie ever made where superman actually throws a punch , the first superman movie where its about superman finding himself instead of a romance movie that has superman in it , and they decide to trash it through product placement .

1 This is n't a `` today '' problem . Trailers have been severely spoiling films ever since they were still literally `` trailers '' .

1 My great grandmother was a full-blooded tomahawk

1 Said like a true storyteller

1 This movie looks incredible . I knew I wanted to see it before , but seeing this trailer fucking solidified it

1 Looks like Cubase or digital performer .

1 Uh ... exactly which book was Star Wars adapted from ? Or did you not read the directions ?

1 He was n't in it but he did somewhat recently direct Journey to the West . By far my favorite movie he has done .

1 `` Luminous beings , are we . Not this crude matter . ''

1 The office ?

1 Upvoted for John Glover .

1 party pooper

1 Do you know what a plot hole is ? Just because its highly unlikely does n't make it a plot hole .

1 Yep , highly doubtful he 'd turn down $ 50m .

1 Great point ! That could totally fit . They have nodded to characters with subtle references like that before ( e.i captain America )

1 Maybe if you post on / pol / and disregard reality .

1 The Raid was about a random drug raid in a tall building . Dredd was about a routine triple homicide case at a certain city block which indue snowballed into bigger serious situation . That 's how I view it .

1 Love them both , but not sure one is better than the other .

1 Why is there a picture of Harvey Keitel ( from Dusk 'til Dawn ) in there ? EDIT : I got trolled

1 They basically did . I loved Fassbender in it & I do n't mind the South American doctor .

1 Agreed . This is a horribly underrated movie and some of Cage 's best work .

1 Read past tense , he was n't telling you to read it , or calling you a fucker .

1 mpaa is a joke though , just fyi .

1 `` Hi Dad '' soup .

1 I enjoyed the movie alot how it was , but I genuinely agree with you . I wish we got to see Cap lay out more people and use his athleticism more realistically .

1 Number 5 alive !

1 Digital IMAX can refer to two different things . Both being negative ! 1 ) A digital IMAX theater is just a regular theater with a slightly larger screen . It 's just the IMAX company whoring out their name and diminishing the brand for extra $ . Digital IMAX is the same as `` fake IMAX '' Where as a 15 / 70mm ( a reference to the film being used ) IMAX is a FULL IMAX screen showing the true screen ratio the IMAX movie was filmed in . Here 's a comparison : http : / www.filmxtra.co.uk / blog / wp-content / uploads / 2012 / 07 / tdk-imax-compare.jpeg 2 ) Sometimes movies are also `` digitally converted '' to IMAX and get put in IMAX theaters . This digital conversion is also a load of crap . The digitally converted IMAX movie keeps the same aspect ratio of a regular movie , but just gets thrown on true IMAX screens and they charge you for the same price ! But you end up watching the movie with black bars on top and bottom ... . Some of the few films that were with with TRUE IMAX cameras are the Dark Knight movies , Mission Impossible 3 , Catching Fire , and the soon to be released Interstellar by Christopher Nolan .

1 I like when he saves the dog .

1 Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey

1 Mistral looks so badass though ! Maybe some sort of throwback . http : / www.millionslook.com / wp-content / uploads / 2011 / 09 / drive-movie-poster-2011-1020711839.jpg

1 He 's also Admiral / Captain Pike

1 Keep your downvotes at bay , but I 'm honestly not a huge sci-fi fan . For some reason I can never get into the storyline for most of the movies , idk why . That being said , I recently saw Alien , and i fell in love with it . I rewatched it twice afterward . Because of that , I 'm going to see Prometheus tomorrow night at midnight , hopefully I can broaden my views and start getting into sci-fi .

1 the film is about the progrssion of mankind from apes to humans to something more , as guided by thr mystrious obolisk . once apes meet the obolisk , they develop the notion of using tools . Once a humas meets the obilisk on jupiter , he is transformed to something new , the star child as he tends to be referred to . As for Hal , like humans , we witness a.i making an advancement , developing emotions , becomimg confused . it has been suggested that this change has to do withthe obilisk as well , but that one is up for debate

1 they also do n't ramble on for 5 minutes

1 Sorry , what would a show have to be to * not * be `` junk food '' ?

1 Weird cause this was one of my favorites . DIFFERING OPINIONS !

1 Or it is a pointed attack on meaningful existence , or anything . You do n't know shit about it .

1 Nah you just need to send a crazy Matt Damon ahead of everyone else to do the killing for you . Edit : A word

1 Did you get your vocabulary work for your composition done ?

1 Birdman . It 's going to be film of the year . Until December .

1 Great movie , great scene .

1 You 've actually SEEN Leonard Part 6 ? Wow , so you 're the one . That movie was so bad that Cosby , instead of promoting the movie , made appearances telling people NOT to see it .

1 If they did that it 'd all be kill the Avengers franchise . Avengers 2 now without Iron Man , Black Widow , Thor and Hawkeye !

1 It has a theme park that just got expanded with another expansion on the way in 2016 plus a second park that opened in Japan in 2014 . Some people are underestimating the HP franchise .

1 I also think the karate kid is a bit too `` kid '' . It 's ridiculous to see Jacky Chang fight children . In the original they were high school seniors not 11 years old .

1 Pretty sure I remember there being a window between rental availability and purchase ability . Along the same lines as hotel movies . Then the movie store would charge a crazy amount for a lost movie because the movie wasnt out yet .

1 CA gets really , really bad on old shitty tapes . This bad .

1 I think it is as an accident and he credits it to his powers . This movie is from his point of view , and you have to remember ... he 's not mentally stable .

1 Do you mean highly rated on IMDb ? Either ways , what you are missing ? Think about it in a different way , maybe you 're not missing anything at all , maybe it 's the movie . Other than that , I ca n't really recall El laberinto del fauno ( 2006 ) being hard to follow .

1 Wow you watched a movie you pirated 6 times ? That 's incredibly not impressive at all .

1 I did n't even think about that ... wow , that 's a really cool motif to notice .

1 My friends call it Baseball . Make it home and you get to exhale .

1 That 's an interesting way to answer the question ... I never would have thought to answer like that . You are a very smart man / woman

1 Not any more western ones . Seriously , Godzilla with Matthew Broderick was such a fucking let down . As a hardcore Godzilla fan since I was like 7 , that movie pissed me off so bad that it made me start waiting for a new Japanese one .

1 The reply to her post was amazing : `` @ beejoli did you get a nose job ? the picture from before your QT thing your nose looked like a hand shovel now it looks more normal '' http : / i.imgur.com / xgz9nkR.gif

1 But it makes no sense . That Jordan guy who 's supposedly Johnny Storm is supposed to be Sue 's younger brother . Teller and Jordan look the same damn age !

1 Fitting .

1 > Part of me wonder if BF4 was a clusterfuck because Dice did n't give a shit and is focusing balls deep on this Sadly , I think this is a pretty long shot . Personally , I 'm going to wait a week or two before giving in and buying Battlefront . I 've learned to not give in to the hype , and to not trust reviewers ( unfortunately ) .

1 No ? Oh my . You 're fucked .

1 You should n't pick movies to watch based solely on the fact that people on reddit like to quote them .

1 How exactly is that bullshit ? The studio can leak pictures if it wants , individuals on set ca n't , if they 're caught they get fired ? What 's the problem ?

1 This is a great list . A Separation is a brilliant film .

1 [ Ha . ] ( http : / weknowmemes.com / wp-content / uploads / 2011 / 10 / land-before-time-drawing.jpg )

1 Seen it . Loved it .

1 Watching this currently . Pretty damned terrible .

1 The way I feel about the movie is that it addresses really obvious problems ( every unpopular teenager ever has thought of every single point already ) and mostly just works as a vehicle for the director / writer to just rant about things . No one in real life just stops and delivers long-winded speeches about `` what 's wrong with America '' . 6 / 10 imo . It was entertaining , but very preachy and as you said , it tries too hard .

1 I fucking LOVED Stealth

1 That 's still a bad rationalization because of the fact that there is a large amount of water just hanging out in the air all the time ( perhaps you 've heard the term 'humidity ' ? ) . Corguinho , Brazil was specifically referenced in the movie as an alien landing site ( it is the city they show the alien footage on tv from ) . It is quite humid there nearly all the time . You would n't want to be walking around that city if you were allergic to water . And that 's without getting into the incredible unlikelihood that aliens that look pretty much like we do ( basically meaty humanoids ) would n't be made up mostly of water like we are .

1 I can see it now ... The ships of your Negro overloads landing ashore on the beaches of south Africa . Internet starved Caucasian suburban teenagers being carted off the ramps of the yachts they were transported with . Mothers protecting their spouses as the metro-sexual fathers protect their made up faces . They are lined up on podiums , plump but slightly unsatisfied as the bidding begins . The Caucasians look over the heads of their soon to be owners as a seed brews in their heads ... * REBELLION * ... and the inquiry for the closest cyber cafe .

1 well a lot of comments that praise movies like `` omg I 'm so hyped '' , `` this looks like the best movie of the month '' etc get upvoted and they hardly add to the `` conversation ''

1 Yeah , while the characters are different , his ability to play the `` goof '' means he should have the comedic timing to get Nathan 's `` jokes '' right . Nathan is n't a goof , but he does crack jokes .

1 Herp deerp he 's stuck in a time loop , deerp , it must be a rip off of that one comedy from years ago , derp . I bet you thought looper was a ripoff of timecop , too , did n't you ?

1 I did n't mention Ledger in my comment , because it 's kind of assumed at this point that he was the best thing about the movie . His performance is that engrained in us , it goes without saying .

1 Damn . I was filled with joy for all of 2 minutes .

1 perfectly !

1 Whoa .

1 This is n't really an appropriate subReddit for this . Just sayin ' .

1 * Bend it Like Beckham * .

1 Brilliant . It 's also a perfect rebuttal to the recurrring `` Why did n't the mercenaries nuke the giant smurfs from orbit ? '' theory : if they had tried , they would have triggered the computer 's anti-spaceship / anti-asteroid defences , and would certainly have been blown to bits .

1 Look it 's not about that . No Country For Old Men for instance runs by a similar premise but pulls it off really well . It 's the disjointed and hyper sentimental qualities of the film . Some scenes are masterpiece , others may as well be in a soap opera . It 's the fundamental inconsistencies like that .

1 what the hell happened to this country ?

1 The first time i watched The Usual Suspects i knew nothing about it either , it was a good first viewiing .

1 I didnt find it jarring , and I think the idea of simplicity is still there . [ While hugh jackman 's character went to lengths to clone himself ( albeit impossible ) , bale 's character ( s ) were two twins -- a much simpler trick than what jackman had thought of . The audience doesnt expect it : they want to be fooled . that 's the line that the entire movie revolved around , and I thought it wrapped up the movie well . ] ( / spoiler )

1 In the mid-credits scene two of Thor 's Asgardian warrior friends ( Sif and ? ? ? not sure about the names ) [ ] ( # s `` deliver the Aether ( red power thing the dark elf used ) to a dude named the collector '' ) , that character will also be in [ ] ( # s `` Guardians of the Galaxy '' ) , and according to the comics , [ ] ( # s `` he is an elder ( AKA he 's been alive from around the start of the universe , also immortal I think ) , and because he 's basically bored as shit all the time , he decided to collect artifacts . '' ) The reason he says [ ] ( # s `` 1 down , 5 to go '' ) , is probably because POSSIBLE FUTURE MOVIE SPOILERS : [ ] ( # s `` the Aether is one of the 'gems ' for the infinity gauntlet , with which Thanos wrecks shit in the comicbooks , people assume he 's going to be the bad guy in Avengers 3 .

1 Snoop was a pilot iirc

1 The animated movies and tv series have been pretty damn good , so I 'm inclined to agree . What if Warner Bros took a huge budget and made an animated Justice League movie fit for theaters ? Is the world ready for that kind of greatness ? Can it even be done ?

1 Russell Crowe had 4 months of singing lessons.. That was money well spent . & # 3232 ; \_ & # 3232 ;

1 They mention several times quantum data , I would imagine by that point they 're using quantum computer and using quantum entanglement to retrieve data . Also TARS refers to young Murph saying SHE wo n't be able to understand the data for decades , that 's why Coop pushes off the looks for Murph when she 's older to transmit the data via the watch .

1 Good point . I 'm pretty sure no one expected T1 era Linda Hamilton to turn into one of the most badass protagonists of all time .

1 I think the biggest Easter egg in that film was the Wayne Enterprises logo on the satellite .

1 For me it 's the scene where Manny tries to pick up the woman by waggling his tongue . `` Bitch ! Lesbian ! ''

1 Saw it for the first time recently . Utterly ridiculous and stupid . I have n't laughed as hard in a while .

1 Hey , Mrs . Rumsfield , no tan lines . Looks nice .

1 Christ you know who we mean Willem Fucking Dafoe

1 I disagree with Robocop . Sam Jackson 's role was fun and necessary . I liked Robocop remake , even as a die-hard fan of the original . Never subscribed to the anti-jerk about it .

1 You got ta hump it into submission

1 The third level had some pretty insane timeskipping going on off screen . It would be impossible to match up .

1 He probably just had a sip of Colt 45 and it grew instantly .

1 I 'd argue Errol Morris is also a fantastic documentarian .

1 [ Yes . ] ( / spoiler )

1 so edgy . poor taste

1 Yeah most trailers these days tell you the entire plot . Glad this one did n't

1 Yep . Otherwise your whole bathroom would stink , your water would n't ever stay in the bowl , and you could be exposed to potentially harmful sewer gasses . It 's similar to how showers and sinks are routed . Sinks are the easiest to see in your own home , just look under the vanity !

1 Julianne Moore has had the award locked up since Still Alice premiered . This awards season is just going to be one long coronation for her

1 The `` Anybody Want a Peanut '' table snacks are what made me love this ...

1 `` If only I had the guns , Mr. Tweed , I 'd shoot each and every one of them before they set foot on American soil . ''

1 Once I guess ? Since this is the first Superman movie featuring his origin in 35 years ?

1 i love how it changes the whole context

1 Goddamit , stop forwarding things to me . For the last time , I do n't know Quentin Tarantino !

1 New Beetlejuice ? Say whaaaat ?

1 They cut out Ayrs daughter entirely

1 Shut your mouth

1 He did , yes . Through the mouth and palette , piercing the troll 's brain . But let them have their fun .

1 300 was fucking incredible . Zack Snyder is a visual genius when it comes to action flicks like that .

1 Surely he means the book . This entire subreddit is about books , right ?

1 Comcast ( charging me too much for unreliable Internet speeds ) . WAY WORSE .

1 I lost you six months ago ! Get the net !

1 no . jus't no

1 You should have that cough checked out .

1 `` You 've got blue-ish green ... turquoise . Teal ? Maybe ? I dunno . Whatever . You 've got some on you . ''

1 So I 've got that going for me . Which is nice .

1 > I wish I would be able to watch this movie now ! Better ?

1 I give it 6 / 10 , and feel generous with that rating . If Godzilla was given more than 15 minutes of screen time I might have enjoyed this movie more .

1 Billy Madison

1 Not strictly applicable to the OP 's point . See Orson Wells . There are many artists throughout history that have contributed timeless works in their 20s . Also Kurasawa was 25 when he started learning directing . And before that he went to tons of movies and plays and was a painter . This is all part of his 'deliberate practice ' period of 10 years that researchers in human performance have identified as a required rite of passage for 'expertise and expert performance ' ( Ericsson Anders ) .

1 This looks excellent ! Hope it shows up in a local theatre .

1 Yeah , i hear she has been a bad woman .

1 Yep thats how I felt the first time I saw the film projector ... its quite simple the more you watch someone do it .

1 Kiss my converse !

1 This would be an interesting cut of the film - to have Harvey accidentally put it all together early on in the film , and then always asking to meet the batman both sarcastically and to keep up appearances with those who did n't know

1 Since you cited Clint Mansell 's The Fountain , you 'll love Lux Aeterna by him as well . It is known from the movie , * Requiem for a Dream * .

1 i liked the movie a good time pass but for some reason i thought he was going to put on make on the dead women and take her around town to fool everyone into thinking she was alive

1 I 'd break her spirit . Then her body .

1 No . Bruce Willis is the chinese Dennis Rodman

1 Who do you think sent the screenplay ?

1 Hulk Bust !

1 Unlike some Robin Hoods , he can speak with an English accent

1 yes

1 My feeling is the same . I usually do n't like zombie movies because they 're nothing more than a slow march to inevitable doom . The presence of Brad Pitt makes me think this might be something more .

1 If there 's one great letdown I had leaving The Dark Knight , it was not seeing the Joker through the eyes of someone doped up on Scarecrow 's fear gas .

1 That 's awesome ! But the who the hell has n't seen Ghostbusters ! Must be the best experience to see a film for the first time with a crowd like that . I overheard a girl before Aliens started ask her boyfriend `` So are there are good female characters in this ? '' . Boy was she in for a surprise .

1 Not an awful movie .

1 What did n't you like about it ?

1 The miniseries From the Earth to the Moon had Bryan Cranston playing Buzz . If you liked Apollo 13 , you 'd like it .

1 He is n't doing any mental gymnastics . He is n't saying he is right to do it , a reason is not an excuse .

1 You are . If you like the movies , read the books .

1 What 's wrong with that ? I can project .

1 The beginning of Fruitvale Station uses recorded footage of the whole incident the movie is based on .

1 Their edit here is impeccable too . The Coens have a real knack for allowing a shot to linger just long enough to make the audience feel uncomfortable . Murch theory at work , for sure . Less is more .

1 Hello darkness my old friend ...

1 YES ! The car chase with the mobile crane is awesome !

1 You can . It 's a real thing , [ and you can make it ] ( http : / www.eckraus.com / wine-making-strawberry / ) .

1 And yet he only had two oscar nominations himself . One for Zelig , which the Academy gave him because they did not have a special effects category , and for Godfather Part III , which seems like a makeup nomination . I can possibly understand not winning since Apocalypse Now is dazzling to look at , but how Willis went not nominated for Manhattan is incredible . Definitively should have been nominated and probably should have won for All the President 's Men , which is imo his best work . edit : not to mention his other work with Woody Allen , especially black and white like Broadway Danny Rose and Stardust Memories is incredible .

1 Backwards it 's not , mixed up it is . Backwards would be : > Was sentence your oddly written .

1 I think they said he would be introduced before he gets his own movie in 2017 so Civil War is the most likely option for an appearance

1 Those fuzzy little shits tried to eat everyone . Does nobody remember that ? Fuck them

1 I genuinely agree with you . I think it is a masterpiece of visual metaphor .

1 Mitch hedberg

1 I thought it was better than The Hangover Part II , even if that 's not saying much .

1 I loved cabin in the woods , but I still think the In the Mouth of Madness is the better of the two . What does it for me is the creeping horror of it all , and Sam Neill 's descent into madness , which to him seems like it 's the rest of the world going mad , not him . It 's very well done in that aspect .

1 More people know Ridley Scott and trust him as a director than Darren Aronofsky , maybe ?

1 Questionable decisions ? Podcasts gave himself a creative outlet to make money and be natural . Most of his podcasts are hits , Fa tman on Batman , Smodcast , Hollywood Babble-on and Edumacation are all solid revenue generators . From those podcasts he 's had the ability to create Tusk , Batman '66 , and the Krumpus movie . Because of Tusk he got funding for Clerks 3 , his most valuable brand . That movie will make him money . Additionally , he was able to sell Tusk and the ideas based around Tusk to make Yoga Hosers and MooseJaws . In the wake of having 3 movies essentially green lit , a huge podcast empire and a successful comic run again he is able to provide funding for a sequel for arguably his second most famous IP MallRats . While all of this is happening he gets to work with Jonny Depp , hire Depps kid , keep Ralph Garmin relevant , work with his own daughter , keep his buddy Mewes busy , stay true to his indie / DIY ideals and above all include his closest friends and family in his work in Hollywood , one of the most notoriously hard places to find gainful and sustainable employment . Look , the dude is n't making Kings Speach style Oscar grab movies or making Avengers style blockbusters but you can not say that Smith is n't making a lot of smart moves to keep himself relevant while he is looking out for his friends and loved ones .

1 He 's concerned with people in the same way we would be concerned with ants .

1 I do n't think it will really be that bad . Look at how well the marvel movies have done , and that shit is Ultron-convoluted .

1 I love No Country for Old Men . I have often wondered recently why I love it so much . I think it 's because everybody is rock hard . The book makes everything a lot clearer so maybe read the book . I love Chigurgh . He 's more than two-dimensional . He has his bizarre code . He kills his employer because they sent another guy to help . `` NO ! You use the one right tool . '' He seems to see himself as an unstoppable force of nature but he is humbled by Moss . His prediction that the money will be brought to him does n't come to pass . The Mexicans kill Moss and not him . He is forced to see himself as vulnerable after Moss almost kills him at the hotel . There is a telling scene as he hobbles to the bed sweating after the self surgery where he sits on the end of the bed and sees himself in the full length mirror . Perhaps read the book . It 's a fantastic read and you 'll `` get '' Chigurgh afterwards . Then again I love it and if you found the movie boring the book probably wo n't do it for you either . EDIT : Just read what I wrote . Do n't mean to be one of those people who think if you do n't like something you do n't `` get '' it . I just really think there is more going on with Chigurgh than at first meets the eye .

1 Even I was surprised when I first saw him in an episode of Columbo recently . The whole time I was watching it , I was waiting for Frank to break out .

1 Damn son

1 See them ? I 've lived them . OK , that 's a gross exaggeration . But I 've been to the Goonies house in Oregon , does that count ? Either way , good distractions , both ...

1 I love the movie but I do think Penn goes a little overboard here . The overhead shot of all the cops piling onto him just cracks me up , which obviously was n't the intention .

1 Assuning you mean `` political thriller with super heroes '' or `` family drama with superheroes '' ? No . They 're action movies . Not separate genres . I 've seen you around and I know you do n't know how to use reddit or check your inbox because you only ever post parent comments , not replies , so I do n't expect a reply either .

1 you can actually see the camera shake due to the camera man unable to `` contain himself '' during that scene . So you 're not alone !

1 You know , this movie has kept me thinking and wondering about it all night . I think that something more straightforward would not have had that effect .

1 That one 's a pretty damn close second to Being John Malkovich for me

1 That fucking movie . The bomb diggidy .

1 Felt the same . It really comes down to pacing , which it is exactly the same from beginning to end . No scene feels more or less important than the next so nothing is memorable and its just boring . Also the director not caring about story , and just wanted actors to act rubs me the wrong way .

1 Yup I was surprised by Hercules , The Rock was quite convincing in his role .

1 Yeah , and she makes out with Kevin Smith in one of the deleted scenes .

1 > Although the Marx Brothers popularized this routine , it was a familiar vaudeville schtick in the early 1900 's . It is usually attributed to the Schwartz Brothers in 1913 , although there are claims that it was invented by the Lyman twins in 1899 . Charlie Chaplin did it in 1916 .

1 I think it 's severely underrated . There were a few unnecessary bits ( the whole thing is sort of played off as a frame narrative when I think it would 've worked better as just a straight story ) , but overall it was pretty much what you 'd expect : a wild-west stylized * Pirates of the Caribbean * .

1 True , but they were ghostwritten long after Ludlum 's death , once the Bourne Identity movie blew up and people decided they could make money off it . The Bourne Legacy was the first novel of 6 that have currently been written by Eric van Lustbader since the first Bourne movie came out , though they 're all about Bourne himself , while the Legacy movie is not .

1 I 'm an Alien fan and i was keen to see more of the universe that was , in part , explored in the Dark Horse comics . With the later sequels being rather disappointing , many fans hoped that Prometheus would be a return to the quality of the first two movies . It did n't quite work out like that sadly but there you go . I went into the movie with pretty low expectations and found it fairly enjoyable but it 's flaws were obvious , even if the visuals were great . I wonder how much better it could have been with a different screenwriter .

1 > And Jackson was playing the same role again , just racist against blacks this time . I have to disagree quite strongly with that . How often has Jackson played a frail old man ? He was the exact polar opposite of his character in Pulp Fiction . Just because he swears a lot , it does n't mean the characters are the same .

1 I agree . Akira ( and a lot of other anime and manga ) obviously has a lot to do with life after WWII , and actually experiencing what many of us in the west would probably label an `` apocalyptic '' event . I think taking it out of Japan is stupid and pretty insulting . Just call it something else . It 's fine to be inspired by a story ... it 's something else to see a piece of art and culture as a marketing possibility , adapt it to fit your target consumer , and lose the essence of the original in the process . Disappointment .

1 As much as I dislike tokenism and pandering for the sole purpose of appearing `` inclusive '' at the expense of good writing , I do n't think that 's really the case here . As far as I can recall , not a single one of those characters was changed from the race or gender of their original comics incarnation .

1 A .gif can only have 256 unique colors . You have to reduce the size and get the right color palette to make it look the best .

1 His breathing before his death was hilarious .

1 If you found that funny , check out the Amazon reviews for the Diet Haribo Gummis .

1 Wow , that is the first comparison of those two movies I have ever seen . TDKR , while not perfect and a bit of a let down was no where near the disappointment that Prometheus was . First off , they tried to pretend that Prometheus had nothing to do with the `` Alien '' franchise and then SURPRISE there is the alien in the last shot . It was almost like a reverse M. Night Shyamalan ending . We knew what it was all along , yet they thought we would all be shocked by the ending . The problem is Damon Lindelof . That guy is a joke . He starts with some big idea , then ca n't write a second or third act and just tries to `` shock '' people . I really ca n't believe he is still seen as a big budget screen writer . Both movies had plot holes , and yes both are `` pretty '' to look at . The difference is , you can get around the plot short-comings of TDKR . Prometheus was just fucking stupid and that is sad , because there is so much potential in that story , but no , because Damon Lindelof , that 's why .

1 Damn I love Toothless ' laugh .

And although this is a bit weird , I think Thomas Haden Church was perfect in Sideways . He just nailed the essence of that guy .

1 People were more grateful to John Wick for it 's commitment to eschewing the modern Hollywood action styles and give us a good thrill ride . While the Equalizer strayed from pure action in favor of a moral dilemma . Both really good movies , but I think John Wick was farrr more self-aware and focused on delivering on a very simple promise . Either way , I could n't be more happy with the direction the action genre is going if these are indicators .

1 I think it 's not bad or cringe-worthy so much as it 's the one scene in the film that takes you out of the story and let 's you know exactly when the film was made .

1 This thread actually gave me a new appreciation for the first three .

1 I think the problem is that studios realize that the genre is fickle and will die as quickly as it was born , so they RUSH production of these movies . After all , girls who read a book when they were 13-15 years old will be in college by the time many of these movies are released . Even though * Catching Fire * is better off with Francis Lawrence , the first director , Gary Ross ( who did a fine job ) QUIT the sequel because Lionsgate wanted him to pump out sequels quickly and according to a tight schedule . Luckily , they got Lawrence , who has experience directing music videos , which means he works well with a limited budget , a small / tight schedule , and a diverse set of `` diva '' ( nice divas ) personalities . But overall , young adult novel-based films are just being churned out ASAP , and that 's KILLING the quality . It 's not the material itself -- it 's the schedule .

1 Not sure where this is coming from . A lot of these films have very , very little ( sometimes zero ) exposure outside of Japan . I have seen them , enjoyed them , and am recommending them here . Statistically , it 's likely you have n't heard of them . If you have , then kudos on tracking down some solid cinema . And if that phrase is a buzz term or whatever , it 's the first I 'm hearing of it . As far as I 'm aware , that 's a pretty standard expression considering the context of the post . Moreover , get fucked .

1 It 's a great summary of what makes the film standout for the faithful without offering any new insights whatsoever . He 's clearly as enthused about * The Searchers * as any film lover , while being visibly uncomfortable with associating himself with the increasingly-controversial subject matter . This film has been dissected for generations , I do n't envy having to sum it up in a couple of minutes while keeping the intro accessible to people who 've never heard the name John Ford . It 's a challenging film , even moreso because like the best genre films , one could passively look on as it hits all the marks of a western and never give it a second thought . Viewed with proper historical context it 's a rare reflection on what makes the American subconscious tick . Presented with a `` hero '' character who checks all the boxes of masculinity , tries to do right by his own , and shows no fear in the face of danger ; the viewer is forced to confront the dark side of the man 's sociopathic whims and dangerous behaviors . Ethan Edwards is the US in that era , as well as before and after - We should be horrified , but it 's John Wayne and he 's even-tempered most of the time . Just when you begin to trust him , some deranged look will creep into his eyes as his deep-seated hatreds take him over . Much of this review is spent , however , subtly letting us know that the reviewer is not a racist . Ca n't blame him , in the `` identification '' culture of filmgoers it 's thought that the sole reason anyone enjoys a film is through identifying with the main character , rather than viewing the larger context and implications of the narrative . If * The Searchers * was n't so widely revered it would probably have been washed away long ago by the revisionists . Great films should n't die because we think differently now .

1 It 's fair to defend it , but saying , `` It 's supposed to be like that cause that 's how he made it , '' is n't really defending it . Lack of emotion * is * a defensible directorial choice , but the emotion is n't missing on purpose , it 's missing because it 's always poorly executed . * Inception * is supposed to be emotional , * The Dark Knight Trilogy * is full of supposed-to-be-emotional scenes , but they fall flat because his characters are n't well defined as people to earn any emotional connection .

1 That Aziz is [ always messing up ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Lw1vScK-o7U ) .

1 I mean , anyone who has a main part on Broadway definitely is better than `` can not sing ''

1 I find it interesting that The End Is the Beginning Is the End was a main piece of the soundtrack of Batman and Robin , a movie that tainted the entire genre of comic book movies by being a complete farce . Years later the trailer for Watchmen used a b-side of that song , The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning . I still wonder if whomever scored the Watchmen trailer made a deliberate stylistic choice for the trailer for the movie of the novel that many point to as the posterchild for comics as a legitimate storytelling medium .

1 I experienced that in LA countless times . Hollywood and Sherman Oaks , Burbank , Downtown at LA Live . Ads , ads and ads again . For Django Unchained at the Arclight in Hollywood , opening weekend there was nearly an hour of ads and trailers before the start of the film . I know because I timed it .

1 Inception was nominated for 8 awards , including Best Picture , and won 4 of them . It was one of the biggest winners of that year .

1 `` ... time to die ''

1 Does that really count as a plot twist ? More of a gag than anything imo

1 Just remember , she 's 1 of 2 broke girls ...

1 Loved that `` I 'm the Juggernaut , bitch ! '' line .

1 Cuz they performed it on stage and radio many times before it was ever on film .

1 Hmm . In a double-bill with * Twins * or * Kindergarten Cop * - ?

1 It is supposed to be a trilogy - DeBloise originally intended it to be but was n't sure if he would ever get the green light , so the first movie was given an ending that would be satisfactory in case the trilogy never happened . And he plans to end the trilogy in such a way ( an explanation of why there are no more dragons ) , that there wo n't be any more sequels - not canon sequels anyway . Dreamworks wants more sequels , but DeBloise is holding his ground . For being re-written and re-animated in 9 months , the first film did remarkably well . The second film had the benefit of 4 years , and innovative new tech that Dreamwork came up with , so I dunno where you came up with the idea that HTTYD2 did n't do things differently . The new tech allowed the animators to edit the characters more similar to how 2D animators would , allowing for more organic and complex animation . Their lighting is also something rarely seen in animation , which is thanks to their cinematographer Roger Deakins , who typically works on live-action films , not animation .

1 I 'd like to see them morph the names together something like ... BATman ... Or ... SuperMAN .

1 That would make a temporarily incredibly sad ending just incredibly sad .

1 They say it 's to make their fusion reactors work or something along those lines . But yeah , humanity has an energy crises and that the solution to it .

1 This , haaard !

1 Thanks for an actual answer instead of referring to breaking bad .

1 Someone DID like it ? In all honesty it was just a big show . As is , `` Ooooo ! CGI jabberwoky ! Ooooo ! pretty colors ! '' The story was cute , but mostly it was just one big 2 hour spectacle with no real substance .

1 Meet Joe Black was alright .

1 The artifacting in combination with the BIG RED TEXT makes this look like a 2005 movie poster .

1 Weirdly , I think every few thousand years , Ragnarok rolls around , all the Aesir and their assorted rogues gallery have a final battle that kills them all , but due to the nature of how `` Gods '' and such work in Marvel , the Aesir are born anew afterwards . I am not going to get sucked into the Marvel wiki today though , so you 'll have to be the one to Google it .

1 It 's about time you break it off with him . Sorry , but there 's not much more you can do to save your relationship .

1 Well are you going to tell us why you think that , or is this just a typical Reddit karma grab ? C'mon , add some substance to your post . I 'm getting tired of BEST MOVIE EVAR posts .

1 Well that was a silly choice .

1 Sin City .

1 4U

1 Not anymore . Now it 's hoodies and sweatpants .

1 I think the [ IMDB best Shorts list ] ( http : / www.icheckmovies.com / lists / shorts / ) is a pretty good collection of all the best short films ( though there is always the IMDB fanboy problem ) . That said the icheck version of the list I sent you has a link to all of the shorts in the comments for each individual film . As for some of my own personal favorites , here are five must see ones in my opinion . [ Everything Will Be OK ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=1IUX0Qy-IDM ) ( this is actual part one of a three part series that I think combined is one of the finest animated films ever ) [ The Man Who Planted Trees ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ampqPdTV_z0 ) [ La jetee ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ezkAeQuUqCg ) ( must see for 12 Monkeys fans ) [ Balance ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=kkxOHD7-3E8 ) [ Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge ] ( http : / www.liketelevision.com / liketelevision / tuner.php ? channel=139 & format=movie & theme=guide )

1 It would make my depression VANISH instantly . At least for an instant , anyway .

1 This needs to be at the top .

1 Fascinating , I never knew that Christopher Nolan was a fan of the Beastie Boys !

1 they did say it , an hour before you . funny enough when i looked at this page your comment was directly under that one .

1 Good night then

1 No sometime in the '80s he was bonded with adamantium .

1 Okay fine , I 'll go buy a pair .

1 I actually saw it in theaters and really liked it , but it kept suffering from marketing backlash of `` Not being CGI have n't you heard CGI are the * future * ' which was pretty commonplace to hear back around 1996-8ish after Toy Story hit it big and Disney 's main outings started to suck or at least not clean up like their early 90s stuff ( Hunchback , Hercules , Mulan ) .

1 Quite the contrary , the books criticise organized religion quite viciously .

1 * They 're

1 I just do n't understand your brain . You 're spelling it wrong . WRONG . WRONG ! [ WROOONG ! ! ! ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=McAeQiLmEYU )

1 Big Gulps , huh ? Welp , see ya later !

1 we might have different definitions of the word `` half ''

1 Best movie that portrays the mental side of warfare , imo

1 I guessed it too , but I also think the main twist is on the steps at the very end . When he makes it clear to Ruffalo that he remembers before going to get his brain smacked with a chisel .

1 it would n't be as funny if he did n't .

1 Wait , so Hugh Jackman jammin ' to some sweet beats and spinning in his chair in front of a bad ass mega hack 6-screen worm screen saver was n't legit ?

1 Except Kick-Ass

1 It says Spoiler in the topic , if it gets spoiled for you you 've only yourself to blame .

1 > George Lucas ripped off John Carter from Mars . George Lucas ripped off * everybody * . One of the problems with his later work is that he stopped ripping off people who were better than him and started stealing from himself .

1 Yeah definitely her role was tame but that ending though . It gave me fucking goosebumps . Not to mention how real they kept the idea . I like that it was grounded and did n't shoot to be anything too crazy for a scifi flick . I definitely was on the edge of my seat as well .

1 If you 're going to hire Machete to kill the bad guy , you better make damn sure the bad guy IS N'T YOU !

1 The two people who die of old age in zero G while having sex . Final straw for me . No rhyme or reason or avoidable mechanism to that . It 's like the arbitrary death of someone written out of a TV show , in that it does n't have a story or develop the plot or make any sense .

1 I was gon na say , 2011 called ... ..

1 Yes , the movie was greenlit because the games were successful , that goes without saying , but the story is only related to WoW because WoW takes place in the Warcraft universe . The movie is probably more closely related to the RTS game Warcraft : O & H because the movie is about the meeting between humans and orcs like W : O & H . WoW is set 25 years after Warcraft : O & H .

1 The thousand smoking ruins of forums you will never know say otherwise .

1 Yo dawg , mad pretentious comment !

1 Films planned through 2028 , so you have a long while to remain pissy .

1 I think * Gravity * is the obvious choice here .

1 `` So uncivilized . ''

1 Yes . He 's freaking buff now lol

1 To be honest that 's the worst part of the film . If I was religious the message of this film is `` Did something terrible in your life happen ? Why not deny the truth in-front of you and make up a nice story to make yourself feel better '' . Which is pretty much the atheist view of religion .

1 The first one deals with the consequences of traveling back in time , a comedy demonstrating the dangers of the Grandfather Paradox . It largely sticks with that , avoiding what happens if you travel to the future and back and forth in time generally , until the happy ending . And Part 2 picks up from that exact point both narratively and thematically .

1 I 'm a horror purist , and a cynical one at that , and I think that The Conjuring is one of the best to come out in ages . Nothing very groundbreaking , but the pace and mood of the film are terrifying .

1 I 'm finding myself very fascinated by it because of this movie . I understand there are markings for places where people have died ( including discarded items ) ?

1 i do n't know IMO the lion king level was way better then the little mermaid and they actually used different plot

1 I 'll possess a thousand corpses before I let this company die .

1 If you 're going to Cannes , it 's because you 've got something to show off or you 've been invited to attend . They do n't sell tickets for people who just want to be there . However , some activities are open to the public . Most notably , they hold night screenings on a beach for films being screened out of competition .

1 Exactly , whether I agreed with his reviews or not they were always interesting and usually funny .

1 `` Cole Dies Twice '' could also work .

1 You wan na get really light-headed ? Look up his books about the Napoleon film he never got to make . The price is astounding to say the least .

1 > I feel like men will watch the film and feel justified about being paranoid about women . these are the same people who walk out of * Fight Club * wanting to start fight clubs . They miss the point . Amy Dunne is portrayed as someone who 's exceptional in how psychopathic she is . If I were more flippant , I would call her the uberbitch , but that falls into the same gender trap as Nick when he calls her a cunt ( I see this scene as evidence that marriage brings out the worst in people . It is n't as explicit in the film , but Nick fears he 'll become like his misogynistic father ) . It does n't matter what her sex is . She 's a murderous , high-functioning psychopath . And like any other murderous , high-functioning psychopath in pop culture , watching her get away with the crime can be fun .

1 Hey now . Con Air is a national treasure .

1 I forgot everything you said after rectum ! !

1 you need to open more cans you bitch . more cans = more moni .

1 It reminds me of Rosemary 's Baby in so many ways , but instead of having an enormously protracted narrative , it 's super tight . It seems like a great 1980s response to a 1970s series of devil worshipping horror films , but made in the 2000s . Great movie .

1 It 's incredible - she totally deserved it

1 goddamn its jaime lannister . great trailer for something i 've never heard of , thanks .

1 I like the cut of your jib .

1 Yeah ... hey guys let 's tone down the entire movie just so we can make a sensorship joke . It will be so funny .

1 That 's such a good line , though . The execution must have been awful for people to have disliked it .

1 I very recently watched them . I thought they 'd be over hyped mediocrity cause people talk about it so much still , but they were actually all pretty awesome ! There are awesome adventures and great humor too .

1 Haha ! I threw that shit before I walked in the room !

1 Almost.. haha

1 And in every other moment of his goddamn life .

1 It 's directed by Paul W.S . Anderson . Stay far away .

1 Upvote for Scream . I will always watch any Scream movie , anytime I see it on . Also , Super Mario Brothers . I have a thing for cheese and campy things .

1 You ca n't think of one because it is n't done . Just as you could n't say `` all you need is mouse / chair / example '' . Because kill , like those nouns , describes a discrete object ( it means , of course , an act of killing ) , so proper English form requires at least an indefinite article to complete the construction . It 's not a broad conceptual word like love / economics / passion / theology , where the noun points to something general , without a need to signify that a particular example from the class must be selected for the attached verb in the sentence to be performed , and so the complete construction requires no article .

1 I think Ratatoiulle was overatted .

1 That was awesome . Thank you for the link !

1 Oh god , I love that movie . But the trailer for it is fucking * horrible * , it makes it look like the cheeriest , most childish little adventure movie ever created .

1 Dead Man 's Shoes , watch that one .

1 The problem is entirely the script . Not awful but just very generic and average .

1 Fry looks way too badass in that pic .

1 And it led to him almost dying . It makes sense that after that experience he became a lot more defensive .

1 I was thinking about it from the point of view of someone who had n't seen the movies yet . If this was my first introduction to the Matrix trilogy I would first of all be amazed at how good this trailer is . Then I would curse myself for watching such a spoilerific trailer . For people like us who have seen the movies , it 's just great . It even made me want to see the sequels again .

1 I dare you , I double dare you , motherfucker !

1 Says four hours here . I believe him .

1 I 'm fine with that . So many big , established people use Kickstarter to fund projects they ca n't get funded by a studio ( or , often , where the studio would rather get fans to pay for a huge portion upfront because it 's now an option ) when they still have plenty of opportunities to create quality work . I 'm a huge fan of del Toro , and if he could n't get funding for * any * movie I could see contributing to a Kickstarter , but as long as he 's still making movies , I 'm happy . I 'm tired of seeing Kickstarter used as a platform for successful studios to raise risk-free money in advance without having to provide a substantial return on investment .

1 First thing that came to mind .

1 No offence , but that was so convoluted it might actually work . IMO better than the sexist pretend to be callgirls angle .

1 You are .

1 All aboard the karma train .

1 I would say `` If it is , you get to choose whether you want to be punched in the dick or the face , and you have an hour and half to think about it . ''

1 I like these . There was a fellow who went back and recorded on video the locations of all the Sergio Leone Italian Westerns . [ Here is The Good , the Bad and the Ugly locations ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=q2tKfBOv9Xs & feature=related ) .

1 There were much better deleted scenes , I feel - such as the one where Cap goes wandering through the city and ends up at Stark Tower . If anything , Cap missed out on the best scenes . It 's no mystery that Iron Man is the favourite ( already on his third movie ) .

1 I 'm here to learn stuff .

1 `` Always bet on black . ''

1 Instead i 'll be 24 and seeing it in theatres ! Edit : 25 before it comes out , probably .

1 Not surprised , that was my very first thought when I saw it . Too bad . I do n't like James Gunn 's sense of humor most of the time , but that line was spot on .

1 `` Both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight have set the bar very hard but I know that Christopher Nolan can do it . '' Possibly the worst sentence I have ever read .

1 You got it !

1 * Revitiligo

1 That 's exactly what it is .

1 He 's talking about the joke responses ...

1 He can tune !

1 Every Transformers movie has been nominated for a sound award , so this is pretty likely .

1 [ Not as much as Harvey Weinstein ] ( http : / www.dailymail.co.uk / tvshowbiz / article-2282295 / Study-reveals-Oscar-winners-thank-Harvey-Weinstein-God-half-mention-Academy.html )

1 People take things personally . If someone does n't like it , they may question why they like it .

1 uh ... besides the found footage format what do those movies have in common , like at all ?

1 Annie is so original .

1 That 's a good thing .

1 Ah if any film deserves rewatching it 's No Country . I find every time I watch it I love it even more .

1 Darren Aronofskys `` The Fountain '' . So underrated and brilliantly directed

1 And funeral .

1 Better watch the movie first before you shower it with nerdgasmic superlatives that it will never live up to .

1 Let yourself enjoy the next 13 months .

1 And that makes everything OK ?

1 Mr. Bimble ?

1 You 're being petty ... . Tom Petty .

1 I 'd argue that the Elves and Orcs were the only `` armies '' present . In the big overhead shot of all the Elves , Men and Dwarves before the show started there was , what , 50 guys in there ? That 's not an army , that 's like 4 squads . And the dwarves may be tough , disciplined and well organized , but there was maybe a battalion of them . Meanwhile we had badass orcs swarming in by the hundred with big old trolls backing them up . And then there were a dozen eagles at the end .

1 She 's not even an actress anymore . She 's just a cokewhore .

1 He looked more like Cyclops / Scott Summers from X-2 .

1 I 'm old , memory for details is not my strong suit anymore . On the upside , I remember more of the big picture now than when I was younger .

1 I think the ligeti piece when they touch the monolith is brilliantly unnerving .

1 OP is talking about Star Wars , not Avatar

1 Nope , never called Catwoman , only `` the cat '' in relation to being a cat-burglar . Worked really well in my opinion .

1 Kids ! You noticing all this apocalyptic aftermath ?

1 I understand the reason for what you 're feeling , I just want you to know most would not consider these feelings `` normal '' . At the risk of sounding mean , id reccimend you take some time away from media that makes you feel like that and maybe talk to a friend , family member , it even your doctor .

1 It 's because you double posted this comment .

1 Says the American public . There is no way the various parent organizations would allow movies to be released without guidance for parents . It 's simply common sense .

1 Karen 's Scottish though

1 Yeah wtf TIL people can share names dafuq ?

1 I 've seen every episode . I 've read every chapter of the manga . I 've seen every OVA , and every movie . I know Kenshin as well as I know myself . The live-action movies are good . That is all .

1 Wherever there are pictures of George Lucas , you 'll find ... CAPTAIN BUTTHURT STARWARS FAN !

1 I think it 's fun to watch up until they get to the science convention .

1 Wow , this may be the most informative reddit headline ever .

1 There are so few people that would know what the fuck he was talking about , but to those that got it ... * it would be so awesome . *

1 Mulholland Drive .

1 Little red riding hood could be cast as the villain and the movie would still do mega business . From a fan perspective , Carnage would rule , from a `` getting things going again '' perspective , it does n't matter .

1 Judging from how Belfort was , they probably pegged the amount of swearing right .

1 I agree . They are both shitty . Do n't know if that means a cheater deserves to be stuck in a terrifying relationship with a murderer . He totally should have asked her if they wanted to move . He should have also not ignored her when his mother died . He should not have been shitty to her in general . BUT , because of the nature of the flashbacks and the voice over , I do n't know if we can be absolutely certain how much of what he did is true . He never pushed her or hit her ( until the very end ) . How do we know he did n't ask her about moving . How do we know she did n't elect to give him the money for a bar of her own volition . How do we know anything ... .which is another reason why I love this movie . That and the fact that we can have this conversation about who is the bigger douche , the cheater or the murderer , with valid points on both sides .

1 Yeah Han was much hotter

1 I 'd say yes , i think he 's said it himself and he also said he 's going to release the whole bloody affair sometime in the future .

1 You mean Hank `` I hit my wife one time , the same amount of times as Spider-Man and yet I somehow get more shit for it '' Pym .

1 Right in the feels .

1 The bridge broke its fall . Let 's go with that , shall we ?

1 Pretty sure most of those guys are still alive . Steve Buscemi did an AMA like yesterday .

1 Ummm no . Reese says that to Sarah in the first one when he first meets her . It is then repeated in T2 .

1 I 'll take `` Stupid Fun '' for $ 600 , Alex .

1 It was easy to market because the trailers were awesome because they contained awesome movie material .

1 Easy way to tell if it 's original Nightmare Freddy or one of the sequels : Original Nightmare Freddy did n't have green stripes on the arms of his sweater .

1 It 's called Entourage .

1 I do n't think KOTOR is going to teach you the back stories of any characters in the OT .

1 [ spoiler ] ( # s `` Probably dead in the first 10mins '' )

1 Fassbender would be such an amazing Nemesis from the Mark Millar comic . ( Pretty much a villain Batman )

1 Yeah but that 's so bad it 's good .

1 This movie is truly under-appreciated . I never see it mentioned . When I first saw it , I watched it like 4 times in a row , and I usually only watch movies once ever .

1 Hitler worked pretty hard on the holocaust . Just putting that out there .

1 The first Hulk was a terrible movie . Raimi 's Spiderman was a hit . This is just a shyte looking reboot that 's aimed at the Dark Knight success except they turn Peter Parker into a brooding emo loner .

1 And one of the beholders in this movie * IS * the tiger . So beauty is in ... * THE EYE OF THE TIGER *

1 Exactly . I think he 's being too hard on himself , honestly . He played the Batman that the director wanted and it fit the movie.. he played it well , just the character was n't good to begin with . It was the Batman the movie deserved , but not the one the world needed . Or ever will need .

1 > and to make that worse her ass is cut off . Yes , it 's truly tragic what they did to this .

1 > Probably most disturbing moving I 've seen was `` The Hills Have Eyes '' . Ca n't go wrong with incest , rape , cannibalistic mutants in the desert . I do n't know a single person that was n't at least a little disturbed by that .

1 yeah Katy Perry definitely does not have those vocal chops of lady gaga

1 Yes , love these guys . Do n't always agree with them but I respect their opinions and know their reviews will be a piece of entertainment all by itself .

1 Go see it .

1 Thank you , really well said . I 've been a Lumet fan since Network ( he is in fact on my top 20 directors list . ) I 've rewatched his films so many times and still find more layers and subtlety . He 's a perfect example of Ebert 's comment , `` the finest films ever made were about * people . * ``

1 The Attitude Era was , without a doubt , the greatest era in professional wrestling . It created the most superstars and actually made wrestling cool . The late 80 's and early 90 's , with the Rock N Wrestling Connection , was big , but it was just live action comics for kids . And Hogan was the biggest draw , with Savage being respectable . There were good , solid guys ... great for wrestling fans ( Bret Hart ) ... but as far as both being a cash cow , being the most popular , being the most engaging and most entertaining ... nothing is as good as the Attitude Era . Rock , Stone Cold , Triple H , Undertaker , Shawn Michaels , Kurt Angle , Mankind ... goodness I could go on . Not to mention WCW with Hogan and the nWo , which was HUGE . EDIT : Sorry for going on and on . I just had to name some of those names for nostalgia .

1 True but he was just playing Hunter S. Thomson again . Not that that is a bad thing , just that it is n't a sign of evolving acting or playing different characters . That said Bill Murray has made a career off of essentially playing Bill Murray so what the hell .

1 Joaquin Phoenix . He would be playing a slightly older version of Norman , but it could work if you start to think about it . He could easily capture the personality of a guy who seems innocent but is clearly hiding something .

1 Can also confirm , I watched the edited version on a BA plane in the summer of 2007 . They also removed some other shots where the Virgin logo was visible . Branson and the Virgin plane were in it because Virgin struck a deal with the film makers and helped promote the film .

1 /r/ladygagasass

1 I think someone put it best earlier that Pulp Fiction has n't aged as well as you first believe . Yes , it 's incredible , yes it 's awesome , but there 's just something about it ... Maybe because Basterds is shinier and newer ? lol

1 It 's a YouTuber called 'swoozie 's video !

1 Lance : The exploration I 'd like to do -- and that 's a good word -- is more about being a great chess player in retirement , as opposed to being part of the government ... . because there 's more freedom for a spiritual search about good and evil , that Frank Black is more gifted in . He does n't need Big Brother over his shoulder telling him how to do things .

1 Wristcutters , A Love Story . Loved it !

1 i try to shout `` Its a Trap ! '' whenever I can

1 You mean [ this review ? ] ( http : / rogerebert.suntimes.com / apps / pbcs.dll / article ? AID= / 20110406 / REVIEWS / 110409992 ) It says clearly at the beginning : * Contains spoilers * .

1 How can you make that claim ? It 's like saying your favourite food is McDonald 's because you ate a few fries the other day .

1 Indeed !

1 I watched the sequel , so much fucking fun - I was literally laughing at parts of it because it was so violent , absolutely amazing .

1 Its a funny thing when Batman is actually the worst part of a Batman film .

1 MORTDECAI is n't a movie it 's a hate crime against cinema .

1 My dad loved it and he has the WORST taste in movies . For example , he saw `` Jack and Jill '' in theaters twice . This is enough for me

1 He originally had : Karl Marx - `` Last words are for those fools who believe they have not yet said enough ... '' For those who care . What a tool though .

1 Not at all . This was a pretty bad summer for blockbusters . Sony is only doing this because they have no other male superheroes and they want an avengers style cash cow

1 It has chain guns , bro .

1 Tree of life !

1 Music by Billy Boyd ( the actor playing Pippin ) , lyrics by JRR Tolkien .

1 I love this movie so much .

1 I do n't get it

1 For me in that film it was the side scrolling coridoor fight scene . Fantastic cinematography .

1 Chillin

1 This part is often overlooked . This act was what sent him so quickly to the dark side , despite how hard he was trying to fight it . Once he sensed that feeling of loss regarding Padme , he gave in fully to the dark side that had been creeping in until that point .

1 Sound effects as well . Notably anything remotely loud in any 80s movie sounds extremely squashed .

1 `` clip art for animators ''

1 hahaha ... girls

1 It would have been awesome if they could 've both done the movie appearances together like this .

1 Yeah about 30 seconds into the first time I saw this movie I was more focused on how the hell they did it , rather than the scene itself sadly . Lol

1 Fuck yeah ! Love Ken Watanabe .

1 Honestly , whether or not you find one movie better than the other , it 's undeniable one is far more better in a theater setting . Doubly so if 70mm IMAX is factored in . Do not miss out on Interstellar if you can see it on the largest screen possible . Nightcrawler is just as good at home as it is in cinemas .

1 I 'm sure there was a danger of the building exploding from the force of all that charisma .

1 Damn , you could n't let us be blissfully ignorant ?

1 If people would n't immediately write off movies with actors playing outside their typecasting you would already know this . Little Miss Sunshine , Dan in Real Life , etc..

1 I need that shit on my iPod .

1 In addition to not being `` secret , '' this article was also not interesting . Sensationalist headline + hollow article .

1 You know how there 's some people in this world and you just despise them ? Even before getting to know them ? She 's like that .

1 Dredd taking a major NON-RECURRING character alive , has never happened .

1 But what the fuck ? Another ? Already ! ? REAWY ?

1 O__o

1 ... huh ?

1 It 's a brilliant movie . One of the best I 've seen . It 's just quite sad .

1 So your dick gets hard for Nolan , yet you criticize others whose dicks get hard for Scorsese ?

1 This just in , the game designed as more of a movie than a video game might be good as a movie ! ! !

1 I laughed at that when I read it , but then I kept thinking about 2001 : A Space Odyssey . That movie really does insist upon itself , although I know a few people who think it 's the greatest thing ever .

1 Backstreet backs , alright !

1 > Relatively fresh zombies could use muscles to their full extent , and run faster than anyone ever . Not necessarily . Running takes coordination as well as power . Zombies in WWZ ( the book ) ca n't move very fast because their brains are n't fully functional .

1 And added streaming content ( who knows how much they will add ) is > than 28 days imo .

1 Magnolia

1 Wyld Stallyns * .

1 If the American version of Dragon Tattoo had been assigned to some random director by the studio , to someone without much stylistic flair but who was still competent enough to get the job done , I would agree with you . But Fincher is an artist with a unique way of practicing his craft , and he interprets the source material beautifully . It may be the same ( or similar ) story , but it 's not the same movie . This one very much has Fincher 's stamp on it in terms of shot composition , editing , mood , color , etc . It 's distinctive .

1 Meh , neither was Braveheart .

1 I 'd say in general these micro-charity efforts are , as you pointed out , very inefficient and that money could be much better spent by a large organization which can operate at a much lower overhead . That said , I would consider this case to be different , as this was $ 25,000 which would not have been donated were it not being done in promotion of the movie . The studio was n't just going to cut a check for their entire promotional budget to the Red Cross and hope somebody noticed . There 's really only two possible scenarios here : 1 ) $ 25k gets spent on advertising the movie or 2 ) $ 13k gets spent on advertising the movie and the other $ 12k goes to aid .

1 what if their entire role in the 3rd movie is to be in flashback scenes ?

1 Yep , bit of a drunk too ...

1 Observe and report .

1 Darth Vaders `` NOOOOOOO ! '' in the third prequil flick .

1 60 % of the time , it works every time .

1 They are holding MJ off until 3 because they decided to recast her and thought they were too late into making the movie to reshoot all her scenes . They even said the girl who was cast as MJ was unlikely to be back as MJ in ASM3 .

1 I want Varys to win so bad .

1 No shit .

1 Ok , I kind of pulled that one out of my ass . I should have said `` I ASSUME the more respectable sites have rules against spamming online forums with votebegging '' . I do not know for sure if there are actually sites that do this . But I would expect that a respectable site does not want their users spamming other internet sites to help them get more traffic . I normally consider Youtube a respectable website . Maybe they 're not , or maybe they just did n't see this becoming a problem and thus did n't include this in their rules . But you deserve a little bit of credit . Often these votebegging threads are accompanied by a story about how you deserve to win more than the next guy because your sister / hamster / kitchen sink is dying of cancer , or you work for free to provide shelters for the homeless migratory birds in your neighborhood . You did not use that tactic . Intead , you just made an entirely selfserving thread begging for votes , and offered a bribe if people help you cheat .

1 `` I like your boobs ''

1 Hah , I 'll accept either as a medium for dolling out of death on his part .

1 Why did n't Richard Kelly hire a writer for Southland Tales ?

1 a few years ago they showed it uncensored on NBC which meant that there were nude titties on television . i masturbated to it

1 `` I saw those other Simon and Garfunkel lookalikes , and they do n't even look alike . And they do n't look like who they 're supposed to look like ! And they 're busy ! ''

1 If you 're basing that off the trailers , then yeah it does . Frozen had some of the worst trailers that fail to show almost any of the worthwhile parts of the film , instead deciding to spend time on a secondary character that does n't even show up until late into the second act and barely does anything . Anyone who has seen the movie , however , will tell you that it 's actually a great Disney musical if you 're into Disney musicals .

1 I usually end up watching Black Dynamite and The Raid : Redemption at least once a month . My friends love those movies so if there 's ever any downtime we turn back to that .

1 That hospital on Guerrero St .

1 Ahh ... I just shot Marvin in the face .

1 * Captain America * has a young Howard Stark , who is Tony Stark 's father ( or that may be Howard Stark Sr. , Tony 's grandfather ) . But they can be watched in almost any order , so long as you watch Avengers last .

1 The only song that works is The Times are a Changing in the BRILLIANT intro .

1 Interesting point of view ! I actually remember another comment citing a specific psychological condition brought forth through abuse that would have left the subject similarly indifferent to other humans in general . It 's certainly a close call , and you 're right , the movie cleverly leaves it just vague enough to leave you guessing . Personally though , I still stick to my interpretation just because of the way I would define human nature : By being bound through emotion . It 's not an optional thing for us . This is especially relevant to how the ending scene plays out : Seeing her at the point of having reached her goal , needing no more masquerade , with no one left to observe and evaluate her through a glass wall or camera , this was be the moment of truth , the one time we see her free of any reason not to be herself . And what does she do ? She `` forgets '' Caleb . What 's more , it seems almost non-intentional . You say she might have seen him as just another asshole , but that would suppose some sort of feeling towards him , negative or otherwise . Instead , she tells him to stay put as to not be in her way , makes her preparations for the outside world and ventures through the door without even bothering to close it behind her . It just falls into lock before Caleb can reach it . For me , this speaks for one thing : He ceased to be relevant for her ambitions , so there 's no logical reason for further interaction . There would be an emotional one , however , even for someone with psychological damage . Spite , Schadenfreude , nervousness , appreciation , empathy , regret - anything . Admittedly , she does nick her head in his direction for a split second before riding up the elevator , but it 's void of emotion , as though she is evaluating him one last time , finding no reason to change her mind . In these last couple of minutes , she is cold as a machine . What makes this scene so critical to my understanding of her is that she has clearly shown that she understands a myriad of complex emotions through her sessions with Caleb , emcompassing many that would have been relevant at the last scene . Instead , there was nothing . This leaves me with one conclusion : She has either switched them off or they were fake in the first place . In either case , they hold no sway over her . And that is anything but human .

1 Planes , Trains and Automobiles has a scene with 18 `` fuck '' s in a minute .

1 Josey Wales : When I get to likin ' someone , they ai n't around long . Lone Watie : I notice when you get to DISlikin ' someone they ai n't around for long neither .

1 It was an independent movie that WB tried to kill . That means no marketing .

1 prison break starts sooooo good and the characters are awesome , but it drags on and on

1 Couture : `` What were you in for ? '' Snipes : Tax evasion ... tff ...

1 Agreed ! Such a good movie !

1 It 's alright with me ...

1 Lars and the Real Girl Everything is Illuminated Trainspotting Adaptation

1 In the book it was actually spelled out . The five armies were : - Dwarves - Thorin 's crew and Dain 's folk - Elves of Mirkwood - Men of Laketown versus - Orcs - of the Misty Mountains , as well as others - Wolves / Wargs Have n't seen the film yet , but the Orcs being directly under Sauron 's orders is another thing they 've changed / taken from the Silmarillion / made up .

1 `` Baby can you dig your man ''

1 That dam was n't destroyed by an earthquake , its just Wu Zi needed a power shortage to pull of this casino heist . Shit now I just want a film of GTA san andreas

1 Its better to think of it as a game .

1 Yes .

1 They made the financially viable decision ?

1 There it is .

1 NO . They tried that shit in Hulk and it was horrible . The original Ironman script ( when it was going to be done by another studio ) had Tony 's father being an evil War Machine . Does n't sound as good as what we got right ? They should stick to the comics , skip the dramatic shit .

1 If this counts , then so does Titan A.E .

1 Wrong , Marty McFly actually traveled to October 21st 2015 .

1 You just saw the best part .

1 Totally with you . I think it 's become fashionable to dislike it .

1 No , they are just good voice actors that are charismatic and network well . They probably vouch for each other when somebody needs a voice talent for a show they are on .

1 precisely it .

1 I did n't know he could sing until I watched Frank .

1 The congratulations he gives to Steve Carrell after he scores the date is what kills me . `` I just want to get these shoes home so I can wear them ! ''

1 Behind Goonies .

1 It might be the alcohol , but all I could imagine is `` Steamboat Mickey Mouse '' on that boat spinning the wheel back and forth , whistling along changing the tone .

1 Steve Coogan as THE PAROLE OFFICER ? ! Oh man !

1 I thought he was fine . What was psychopathic ? His speech ? I thought it was good that he did n't speak like Bruce Wayne when he was Batman , especially that almost any adult male can do the rough voice . Otherwise , he did n't do anything that was actually psychopathic . Daredevil-like , perhaps , but he was capable of doing those things .

1 [ * What a casual.. * ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / izH19mt.jpg )

1 `` Looks like you found a gloryhole ! '' That 's totally rusty . He gets reeled in by his wife etc and is like , well shit ... `` Time to hit the road ! '' It looks fine .

1 Good for you man . Hell yeah !

1 That ... does n't make any sense .

1 In which shot ? In all 3 frames above , it is the same green / white striped button-down shirt . - He is clearly removing the razor blade from the disposable razor in frame one - He is looking down on the lit table surface in frame 2 - He is moving the blade across the inside of his forearm in frame 3

1 Dolph Lundgren played by Dolph Lundgren

1 Nope , count me in . This movie is `` Man makes easy decision , faces no struggle , gets everything he wants . ''

1 yeah fuck that bitch

1 That would have been fantastic .

1 He deered to kill a king 's dare !

1 Feel free to submit a post here to drum up discussion . We love to talk all movies ( though , that is n't always apparent ) around these parts . If you want to do it here , I would suggest exhausting your thoughts in the text box and let people respond to that . If you were to just write a post title like , `` Just saw The Hobbit : DoS , lets discuss it '' you probably wo n't get much of a response . Also , truefilm is the place to go for well written , engaging discussion . Just my two cents .

1 I would Tebow to those .

1 Yeah , he 's good in Quiz Show as well so there 's one to check out if you have n't seen it . Also features a lovely cameo from Martin Scorsese .

1 Because it 's said that he was once a Jedi but fell to the Dark Side ... ? We see Darth Vader and know how bad of a guy he is , and we see Obi-Wan , Yoda , and Luke and know that they are Jedi and how good they are . Vader turning back to the Light Side is a big event , as we 've seen how evil he can be .

1 He said delirious ...

1 Today , El Guapo is ... ( Horrified look from El Guapo ) ... ..thirty-three years old ! ( Massive cheesey grin from El Guapo )

1 just watch the entire wes anderson collection

1 In a quiet , mucho suspense , big sudden scares kind of way . Terrifying .

1 They 've obviously evolved proper weaponry to fight the vikings .

1 You are not alone . There is no clarity anymore .

1 It does n't ruin the movie for me , but I get annoyed when a character leaves a home without closing the door behind them .

1 It 's not really a scandal . It was a one time thing , when he was having a mental breakdown and trying to build a weapon that could defeat the Avengers . The story goes he was n't even supposed to be hitting Janet in that panel , just brushing her away ... but the artist took it another direction . Disney and Marvel are most certainly avoiding this angle for the movie universe . I would n't be surprised if he blames himself for her death , though .

1 Yeah . I did n't care for Gangs of New York but Daniel Day Lewis was phenomenal in the movie .

1 Which is saying a lot cause the Oscars are pretty traditionally boring save a few great hosts .

1 Yeah once you accept the plot never delivers it is much more enjoyable .

1 Perhaps not in the world , but in the context of the movie . They were fight fight fight all the way , and then in about five minutes of movie time , they became completely hopeless and killed themselves . It 's undeserved . If the entire movie had been predicated on how hopeless their situation was , it could be justified as the emotional payoff .

1 I honestly laugh at whatever they do idk what it is

1 yeah , exactly . THEN she finds out that old dude hitched a ride on the ship and forgets about the alien completely . and why did david even infect shaw 's boyfriend in the first place ? to get HER pregnant ? for what ? what were his motivations ? also , i loved how the old dude just appears and everyone is all , `` oh , hey bro . ''

1 Currently available on netflix instant watch .

1 I do n't know about `` suddenly '' loving it , but some people have had over 20 years to think about the movie , and perhaps to change their minds about it .

1 It was n't THAT bad but yes , it was definitely dodgy . Seems like the folks doing the dragons for Game of Thrones are winning . That said , I thought most of the CG and the over use of shots that panned way far out looked pretty lousy in the first one . Especially the escape from the goblin city , the movements on the dwarves felt really unnatural .

1 Read the books there is more then just one story about the wonderful land of OZ .

1 I 'm still in awe of [ the scene with Edward James Olmos . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=05bFb1J6kzI )

1 Yes , the first time I saw it I cheered after Holly Martins starts puffing away at his cigarette ! Perfect way to end a perfect movie .

1 Instead of seeing this I 'll probably just re-watch Pirates of Silicon Valley .

1 Oh god ... I would hate-watch the shit out of that .

1 A man ... chooses to genetically engineer dinosaurs .

1 He is a prop maker . It 's sort of his hobby .

1 You do realize that watching it now wo n't cause subtitles to appear in all subsequent viewings , right ? I do n't think anyone was arguing that the scene should have subtitles . It 's not like the video was called `` Godfather Scene That the stupid jackass translator forgot . '' ( Waits for someone to rant about conserving the directors intent in the film , etc )

1 Only it was n't intentional . I was a call back in Hot Fuzz to an in-joke in Shaun that Wrights hangover cure was a Corneto . People just made the connection and When asked Wright joked that it was their poormans homage to Blue , White , and Red .

1 Do n't lie , that pun was definitely intended .

1 I would 've gone for Hoffman in The Master last year , but I 'd put Leo over Waltz .

1 Even though I do n't fully agree I love this review .

1 We need to be friends .

1 Because if they can and do have the potential to earn bigger slices of the multi billion dollar franchise they are the major draws in , why would n't they do it ? If I had the opportunity to earn 50 million , and only earned less than 1 / 50th of that , I would fight to earn more as well . Money like that can secure futures for a family for a long long time ... saying `` I played Thor once '' will not secure futures . It is n't always about having yachts ...

1 She carried every scene she was in

1 If I remember correctly , when they 're planning for it the night before , Cruise says something to the effect of he 's going to make him lose his temper to get him to admit to it . I always thought that made the scene anti-climactic . I always thought it would have been better for them to not have an idea of how to get Nicholson to confess , and have Cruise see him get agitated and go from there .

1 Nah , man , it 's the cape . Capes are swag as all get out , and nobody else can pull that shit off except Thor and Vision , apparently .

1 I have not seen Get the Gringo . I took a poll of those around me at work and no one had even heard of it .

1 Neither are muslims so we can hate them too ! It 's a hate loophole .

1 Epic movie . One of the few you 'll always remeber .

1 I would recommend you avoid 90 % of action / sci-fi .

1 No . I 'm terribly sorry , but I am afraid we can not .

1 If the movie could of kept the same quality as the intro then the movie would probably be one of the best comic book adaptions made .

1 Ryan Gosling stares and says nothing . Bitches like when Ryan Gosling stares and says nothing . Having said that , you 've got my up vote because that was super awkward .

1 The toxic avenger , the room , troll 2 , batman : under the red hood .

1 I was looking for this comment ! Completely agree !

1 I never questioned it , I just assumed she got them in , and took her seat . The movie had so much going on , I just realized , JUST NOW , that she 'd have died in the fire , unless she knew about the bombs and just did n't go in .

1 Next they 'll be trying to give them the vote .

1 Not unless your 15 .

1 I saw a interview with the author . He said he he struggled writing climaxes for his books and he was really glad they got Timur Bekmambetov to direct because he felt like Timur would help the story have a better climax .

1 Sad . He was talented .

1 Fincher has said that he 'd have to reshoot the whole film for him to create a directors cut . I think he 's distanced himself from both the theatrical and assembly cut .

1 One of the few scenes in any movie that my jaw literally dropped during .

1 No .

1 I do n't think you know what in the wide world of sports you 're talkin about !

1 No , this is the best tagline ever : > [ * Sixpack Annie * : She 's the pop top princess with the recyclable can ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0073716 / taglines ) It is physically impossible to create a better tagline .

1 I actually kinda liked the cheesy font and the hand-drawn arrows . It was a nice break from the other breakdowns you see online .

1 `` You mean.. you 're finally gon na let me build a spaceship ! ? SPACESHIP ! SPACESHIPPPP ! SPACESHIP ! ! SPACESHIP ! SPACESHIP ! SPACESHIP ! ''

1 Best Original Screenplay is my favorite category . To me it says this is the peak of creativity in Hollywood right now . It 's my equivalent to Best Picture . And Spike Jonze deserved it more so because he did n't get a directing nom .

1 That soundtrack is amazing ! !

1 fucking proofreading

1 HBO pretty much is .

1 Oh , to be an idiot 12-year-old again . I like to imagine bipolar disorder is like early puberty on crack . Everything `` sucked '' then , but god damn could I appreciate movies .

1 Not great , but expected . Competition is stiff with the Pitch Perfect sequel and Avengers 2 still going strong . Pacific Rim had a similar opening weekend and wound up under performing domestically . On the plus side , it did very well internationally , and Fury Road is expected to do similarly . Good critical response might not help in the long run , but strong word of mouth could . There 's no reason to believe this could n't have a long run in theaters , hitting that 350-400 million dollar mark it would need to break even and spur sequel talk .

1 Alright

1 Use the spoiler tags .

1 All expanded universe material has been retconned . TFA is a brand-new story .

1 Oh god and it 's Baz Luhrmann too . I loved Moulin Rouge . Woohoo !

1 Or the classic Labyrinth with David Bowie ?

1 I thought it was hilarious . Look at all the legitimate points he had to make about Ice Age 4 . Edit : His comment originally said something along the lines of `` Shit post about kids movie , begging for upvotes . ''

1 Boom !

1 I think Phillip Seymore Hoffman would have been more fitting in the Nolan 's universe ( I sure hope that it 's still a seperate universe , if it 's not , I 'll just pretend it is ) . Having said that , the new movie will still have to feature unseen villains ( so that people would be able to make distinctions from Nolan 's saga , maybe with exception of Joker ) , so obviously the Penguin is not off the list .

1 I had hoped it would be like Tora Tora Tora with the latest special effects .

1 This seems to be a Way bigger problem than it should be .

1 My thoughts exactly . That and waited an hour just to see ~10 min of actual fighting . And half of that was Bayformers closeups in a full cg environment .

1 Hearsay as told by a comedian does not good journalism make .

1 Man I am right there with you . The new Dredd went more Nolan Batfilm aesthetic with things , whereas the Stallone Dredd was classic action-figure selling cinematic popcorn . I will say that the new Dredd 's mega-city looked a lot more depressing in the picture you linked than 90s Dredd 's skyline ( which would n't look out of place in Star Wars )

1 Debbie Does Dallas - one girl 's story of moving to a new city . Powerful , inspirational , a feel-good movie .

1 I think that was the only thing those old movies did right . Thing was really good at clobbering .

1 I had read The Hobbit prior to watching the movies , but seeing as I was 11 in 2001 , I 'm not surprised I had n't been interested in reading the relatively more mature and dense Lord of the Rings . I read them following the release of the first movie though , in time for Two Towers .

1 Well stay out of Mirkwood . No one is forcing you to go there .

1 I disagree

1 STOP LIKING THINGS I DO N'T LIKE ! ! HNNNNNNNGGG

1 He 'll get a lifetime achievement award ( or at least he better ) , which in my mind is the most rewarding Academy Award honor . It celebrates not a single performance , but a career of success . It 's one thing to beat out other nominees in a single year for one work with the help of a studio PR campaign , and another to have people stop and say , `` wow , look at how incredible a gift you have given us with your life . ''

1 `` What 'd he look like ? '' `` Kinda funny lookin ' . ''

1 Private sites at least protect you from the government hopping on a torrent and recording the IPs . It 's much less time and hassle for them to do it on a public site .

1 With Elisa Cuthbert and Shannon Elizabeth no less . Haha whatever that 's still one of my favorite storylines in the movie . That one and the pornstars are two of the least shown story 's with the most satisfying ends .

1 sits at like 17 % on rotten tomatoes or something . It 's getting wretched reviews .

1 Was waiting for someone to say Ordinary People . I sail and have a kid brother . I get misty-eyed every time .

1 Porn ?

1 That was my understanding as well . The NASA facility is supposed to be a spaceship that they hope to get off the ground , but the only way to build a ship of that size is to use steel and concrete ... and the only way you are going to get a ship like that off the ground is to have some super advanced propulsion system . It is kind of a throwback to the ship in Asimov 's Foundation Series that uses gravetics and a supercomputer to plot its course making it the fastest space ship in the galaxy . The new understanding of gravity will also allow them to make the wormholes that their future selves placed in our solar system to allow the first astronauts to travel to begin exploring the possible habitable worlds . That is the biggest mindfuck to me and maybe one of the only silly things . Somehow people were able to send things back in time , which is probably impossible ... but the movie supposes that maybe it is n't impossible and that is how coop communicates with murph and with his past self in the first place so that he finds the nasa facility and then transmits the data back so that murph can build the new ships that save the human race .

1 It 's virgin proof , that 's interesting enough for me .

1 The Mary Poppins director 's cut .

1 Well , that was terrible .

1 Just checked Wikipedia . Wow , what a depressing plot .

1 Does n't IMDB have the opposite problem : a bias towards more recent movies ? ... maybe it 's best to combine the two ?

1 Agreed ! Love that movie .

1 They 're bros both in and out of costume . Well , except they usually wear costumes anyways because it 's not like Clark Kent reporter can just drive to Bruce Wayne billionaire 's house for some beers . Because he can fly . Also Bruce does n't drink . Or hang out . So yeah , nvm , pretty much full time superhero friends .

1 OP follows the rules .

1 `` You 've worked with James Gunn since the beginning of his career , what is it about him or his projects that attract you as an artist ? '' `` Will Gotg be in the same vain as his other films or will this be a much more toned down Gunn film ? '' Thanks for taking the questions on here and good luck with your interview !

1 * Cheap Thrills * is the greatest meditation on the subject of depravity .

1 I did n't exactly say he 's a hack or anything . Goyer is a good `` idea man '' . He 's very acclimated with comics and is able to develop a solid story structure , but he struggles beyond that . Regardless , there 's few people out there that have worked harder to bring comics to the big screen than David Goyer . That 's why I said I respect him .

1 i love eurotrip . the title sequence in the style of the flight safety card thing gets me everytime !

1 Really runs the gamut , sometimes a lot , sometimes not at all . If the producer does not have a long track record where you can go back and see a similar pattern to their projects , I would just ignore such claims as marketing gimmicks .

1 As you folks can tell from the comment above , we are clearly capable of it ourselves .

1 [ One Reason ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/AskReddit / comments / wbecj / why_do_we_glorify_and_idolize_fictional / c5bzh2e )

1 The imdb link calls it a `` fake '' ending . So I do n't think it was really intended to end like that .

1 Ebert has always liked the series . The first two got 4 stars , the rest got 3.5 . * Phoenix * got 2.5 .

1 I wish she kicked my ass a bit more . She got cool points for allowing bald soldier dude to at least feel honorable . She also did n't seem to go full superman on him so a little chivalric . Always wins points in my book .

1 Who 's also married Worked a 96hr week in one of those weeks Remodeled a bathroom and a kitchen during those 270 days Also acted in a couple films during that time etc etc Just because I work 8 hours a day for a day job does n't mean that I sit at home and do nothing for the other 16 .

1 Do you know what I just realized , this means no more Avi Arad !

1 What are you doing we 're sitting ducks out here ! This is n't good ! Ok that 's not good !

1 If you 're going again soon , see Ghostbusters tonight and GotG later ... I 'm still in shock from reading that you ahve n't seen Ghostbusters ... * Dies *

1 You should probably avoid watching * Sharknado * then .

1 Pretty much . Essentially no point in seeing the movie . Although to be fair , as soon as I saw it had Statham I knew basically the whole plot since all his movies are pretty much the same .

1 In books you can do a post-climax conflict like that . In movies though , I think it would 've felt really weird .

1 Same . I 'm a huge QT * and * a huge western fan .

1 Well , Mercury * was * larger than life .

1 it was in the same vein as D9 . one of the guides said that `` america built a wall to keep the aliens out , but really they were building a prison for themselves '' . also the photographer 's speech about how you never really know how bad things are or how people live from your prefect suburban home . living in texas , i think i got more of the mexican immigrant resources .

1 I was waiting for the train and I remembered the scene where Walter does the same thing , moment during which he starts daydreaming . I thought to myself `` Damn , I really loved that movie for making me think about what should you do with your life and how much it makes me get out of the house and explore this beautiful world we live in . `` ; pulled out my phone and wrote this text post .

1 I thought it got very repetitive after a few minutes .

1 Just `` your mother 's '' would have sufficed .

1 Inherent Vice is a great film . I will definitely be rewatching it as soon as I can

1 Downvotes should n't even be allowed . I know it 's reddit but it means you 're going to get `` haters '' on all sides . Or just people who want * their * choice to win so they downvote all others .

1 I think it will probably have to do with * SPOILERS * [ this ] ( http : / youtu.be / 1byZkbNB3Jw ? t=1m40s ) scene they show in the international trailer

1 What is a Phillard and why is it funny ?

1 Oh come on man its Superman you know the story already .

1 Well we end with him writing a letter to his ex wife . In a tone that is n't at all bitter . I think Samantha really helped him come out of his shell that he put himself into before the divorce . He learned how to express himself and he learned that he has n't felt everything he 's ever going to feel . I need to watch it again but that 's what I got from the ending .

1 Yeah , no shit .

1 I totally agree in my personal opinion , but that does not necessarily mean that is the category should we end up getting nominated in ( if she were to get nominated at all of course ) . Often times , it is tricky to decide if an actor should get a Best Actor or Supporting nod. Considering that it is a voice-over role , * some * voters may feel it only warrants the latter . Plus the studio may lobby for her in the latter , if they feel like she has a better chance of getting a nod in that category rather than in the very competitive Best Actress one .

1 Its spooky how similar it is to my copy ...

1 Sadly that 's not how it works ... At all ...

1 True , but you have to remember this was at an infancy of 3D animation . Also , as somebody who is trying to get better at 3D animation , have you seen the work it takes to get a proper human walk cycle ? It 's mind numbing and hair ripping . I no longer make fun of old games that had poor walk cycles . You tried , brothers .

1 As a kid of course I liked Adam Sandler but as an adult I appreciate Christopher McDonald 's work as Shooter McGavin and beyond . Furthermore , I now suspect that Sandler took a page from Jerry Seinfeld 's playbook : cast good / better actors to play off of to improve your movie .

1 intrigued ... not really excited though . I have a feeling it 's not going to be that great .

1 I 'd say Dumbledore took James 's death the hardest .

1 Yes , this is most likely cause what worked in the book wo n't necessarily work in the film . In the film WE will already know that Ender is really destroying an entire alien race far off in space , but Ender himself does not realize this . To create suspense I guess .

1 IASIP did it

1 It * almost * happened . Apparently you 're from the Darkest Timeline .

1 Lol . Justice League .

1 I love Wayne 's World , and I strongly enjoy Wayne 's World 2 . I have an extensive collection of name tags and hair nets .

1 Not a really useful spoiler alert if you first say who died and after that for which movie the alert was .

1 `` Oh , hey there Mr. Bond . I 'd really appreciate if you gave me the launch codes or whatever . I do n't really care that much . ''

1 Well , you can argue anything . It 's funny , really funny , but it 's not even close to his best . Most surprising , maybe .

1 I suppose that 's also entirely possible . It is a bit silly to think that she has n't done so much as a Google search of the character to see what she 's like after all this chatter about how she should play the role . I guess we 're gon na have to just wait and see what Marvel does here . Blunt would be a great Captain Marvel , but there 's plenty of other options out there . Marvel has yet to drop the ball in the casting department as far as I 'm concerned , so I 'm sure they 'll find someone great .

1 everyone

1 Who can deny logic like that ? You must be at least part Vulcan .

1 He starred in a spanish film . [ Alatriste ] ( http : / vids.myspace.com / index.cfm ? fuseaction=vids.individual & videoid=18916206 )

1 That movie sucked ... . so much .

1 Seriously dude , why watch movies if not to watch human interaction . Go back to transformers asshat .

1 The Machinist , you mean ?

1 Well why do n't you cut the bottom out of the basket ? We need these baskets back !

1 I would call it a double feature instead of a marathon . I think at least 3 for a marathon

1 Acting was more forced than natural back then . So I think that 's what throws more people off .

1 Always loved The Sword and the Stone .

1 I would watch the * hell * out of this .

1 If they want the profanity from the comics they could have him curse like Yosemite Sam , which would actually be quite enjoyable I would think . It sure as hell would n't feel out of place .

1 > would have been unable not to what a terribly strange thing to say

1 I think you got downvoted more for the `` lie awake crying '' and `` everyone else needs to shut up '' remarks , not because you liked the movie . It 's a subtle difference , I 'm sure , but an important one .

1 Star Wars always had SOME well known actors , it was never totally new stars . Even A New Hope had Sir Alec Guiness who was one of the most respected British actors of his time .

1 * He I believe R.A . Salvatore is the one that wrote that book .

1 Was about say this . He needs to get together with John Woo and give us another gun-porn movie .

1 you know , for kids !

1 I had a friend in high school with that name . Needless to say he always dreaded when classes would focus on the presidents .

1 Well , we 're talking about real people here , but maybe if he died , Jordan Belfort would have stopped being an asshole ...

1 he said in nearly every movie , not all of his movies

1 When I was a kid , I thought `` Yeah , I 've heard of play'doh ! ''

1 ( L * D ) + ( W / G ) ) / ( A^2 ) ? Length times Diameter plus Weight over Girth divided by Angle of the tip squared .

1 Arright boyboy

1 I kinda liked the guy playing the part , and really wanted to love that movie . But it 's just so boring ! I do n't know how long the fight goes on , but it seems interminable . Like the director just wanted to break evertything in Smallville for some reason . I get tired of most superhero battles , but that one is by far the worst .

1 You forgot * OLDMAN * Let the creep-fest begin .

1 you 're not really a 'movie ' person are you ?

1 High profile actors can make demands about how they appear in the credits ( when they pop up in the intro or at the end for instance ) but also things like this . Would you say no to Jack Nicholson ?

1 > invalidates the last three movies and ~~two decades of~~ plot and character development for a literal Deus Ex Machina I still kinda liked Days of Future Past a lot though .

1 Why ? Please , explain .

1 Spartacus was pretty awesome

1 I did n't know .

1 Yeah I hate Carlos Mencia and I still dislike Tim and Eric . I would n't exactly say I hate their show cause it has some funny points but most times I find their humor to be quite awkward .

1 It 's the booze

1 The 14 year olds right next to me had a riot during that .

1 just ordered ! when can we expect it ?

1 The whole family is terrible to me .

1 This is definitely not an unpopular opinion , almost everytime it 's brought up it 's someone saying 'it sucks ' and then someone saying 'Come on , it was n't that bad ' .

1 Fixed .

1 God damn Moebius , that guys art is epic on every level .

1 `` Chewy , we 're home ''

1 I guess it might sound kind of lame , but that 's a very commonly used phrase by people who work on Wall Street . Did n't even think twice about it .

1 Great minds think alike . Loved the intro and when I saw it for the first time I was blown away

1 The scene where Voldemort asks Harry `` why do n't you die ? ''

1 Even closer .

1 Let 's not forget Gallipoli . https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=RGuY5r-7ta4

1 Because downvotes are literally worse than being buttraped by Hitler .

1 And some cheesy bread . Ca n't forget the cheesy bread .

1 Fringe-chill

1 I know a lot of people that are into this movie , but I just never really liked it . It was offbeat but it just seemed totally disconnected and it bothered me -- but not in the way that scary movies are supposed to . Maybe there 's something about it I 'm not getting , and it 's supposed to make you feel differently than other movies , but I just did n't enjoy it .

1 A little bit , but it definitely also seems like a great movie too

1 His mother outlived him . : (

1 Exactly this . _It_ is more than Pennywise , the kids or the turtle . It 's about Derry . Did you read 11.22.1963 ? The main character actually visits Derry and really conveys how uncomfortable that town is .

1 Yeah , i agree . Wish it was perfect being a big fan and all .

1 I 'm hoping Ant Man is a comedy . Would be such a waste of Paul Rudd otherwise

1 His will is bound to the ring . Hes not dead .

1 Fun Fact : The kids say `` The octopus was really scary ! '' Even in the version without the octopus .

1 Really ? I thought the movie was pretty entertaining .

1 They killed the giggler man ! !

1 Agree , the visuals + soundtrack made for an amazing atmosphere . I 'd seen older films scored by Tangerine Dream but Drive was what made me appreciate that style and want to revisit it .

1 I 'm somebody !

1 I 'm totally watching Se7en right now !

1 She fights with a sword in the comics quite often . It was forged by Hephaestus and is sharp enough to cut the electrons off an atom . Which is pretty rockin . Her current series is excellent . She fights with many different types of weapons and even becomes the God of War .

1 All the films you mentioned deal with psychopathy . Anton Chigurh , Hannibal Lector , and Travis Bickle ( to an extent ) are psychopaths , they are humans we ca n't relate to . Lou Bloom is a sociopath , he 's not crazy and we can relate to his motives , even if we do n't agree with them . The movies you mentioned show the dark side of individuals , while Nightcrawler shows the dark side of society , which is a bit more discomforting . I think Gone Girl suffered from this a bit as well . I think both movies should have been nominated over the four mediocre biopics , but the characters were just too discomforting and despicable for the Academy . They prefer more heart-wrenching tales that reinforce the idea that they care about social issues . Taxi Driver , I think , also reflects a lot on society , but it was such revolutionary movie at the time that I do n't think it could have been ignored .

1 Mediafire works great . Fast download speeds and none of the silly wait times .

1 I feel like you were taking crazy pills ! ! !

1 Like ... Like a Cake ?

1 Revenge

1 Besides that , it 's a rad design . I wanted a copy of this poster when it first showed up around here . I 'd say your girlfriend 's got exQUISite tastes

1 Eliza Dushku too .

1 He 's not a great director for actors at all . One of the hallmarks of a shitty MNS movie are the monotone , sullen , emotionless delivery of lines . His characters in everything past The Village have no character . I will never forgive the abomination which is * The-Movie-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named * ; which is a prime example of taking amazing , vibrant characters and putting them in chains for whatever idiotic reason .

1 This is the very reason why Lex hates Superman .

1 And I wish everyone the best , except for my wife who is a filthy , filthy whore .

1 `` Where do you get your weed ? `` `` From you Dante '' `` Oh yeah what 's up Mr Cheezel ! ''

1 I am pretty sure `` equal opportunist discriminator '' is an oxymoron .

1 I do n't know man , I do n't have a crystal ball . All I know is that right now , I like Boyhood . I do n't care what people in 2025 think , and I 'm not going to let fake future people affect my perception of a current movie . 10 years later `` people '' are n't talking about Lords of Dogtown , but I still like Lords of Dogtown .

1 Jumanji is actually still awesome .

1 Fairly certain that the baseball players were called the `` high hats . '' Edit - `` baseball furies ''

1 I just use IMDB and rate every movie / TV Show I watch . You can make lists of movies too which I think is pretty cool ( I use it to keep a list of [ my 100 favorite movies ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / list / ls055752927 / ? publish=save ) ) .

1 Outbreak was great though !

1 Press `` F8 '' to Pay Mad Respect .

1 Cole me down on the panny-sty .

1 Good ! Bales so called Batman would not be able to thrive in a super powered world .

1 He 's a forgettable minor role out of many minor roles in that flick . He played Mexican police , correct ? He did something to help out his dead partner 's family after he was killed ? He had a good shakedown scene where he got paid by some dumb American who had his car stolen . That 's all I remember .

1 `` Life moves towards greater complexity and organization . As Kurzweil says , 'More knowledge , more science , more , more , more . ' '' Illuminating .

1 [ Arnie : The Terminator ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / XWWPiEb.jpg )

1 And actually a really good movie , when you consider it stars Agent Smith , General Zod , and Leonard from Memento .

1 Joe Pesci in the Smooth Criminal video .

1 She 's in this one , too .

1 Reply to re-summon you prematurely .

1 Hopefully it does n't spread too far beyond this closing . Here in NYC , the police commissioner made a point to say that no overreactions such as this would be taking place ( meaning no cancellations of screenings or even extra police / security presence at any theaters ) .

1 Because not only is this reddit , but also r / movies .

1 No .

1 But The Last Emporer is the only movie there thats Criterion . Regard less , the real attraction to Criterion are hidden gems and the universe of special features that come with them

1 Mcnamara ( sp ? ) is such an intelligent guy this one is pretty fascinating . People tend to demonize say , Bush 's Iraq policy people , while not really understanding them . And those policy people have an interest to keep their own propaganda simplistic for mainstream consumption . Whereas Mcnamara was behind Vietnam ( a pretty objective mistake which resulted in atrocities ) and is basically a genius . So there 's a great tension between the intelligence , regret , analysis , justification and history .

1 keep reading ...

1 and that 's why it was posted in this thread

1 Do you mean Nicolas Winding Refn ? Rhys Ifans is an actor ...

1 Stole every scene he was in . My fave part of the movie .

1 Yeah . That was completely ridiculous . I could understand it happening on accident a few times , but they did it on purpose a couple dozen times . It was stupid . This is a movie that gets a few things incredibly right , and a bunch of things embarrassingly wrong . Still worth a watch though .

1 this looks beautiful ! I ca n't wait !

1 That is just not how thumbnails work . Your tv resolution does not magically increase the fidelity of the thumbnail which is a set resolution . Otherwise you would not be able to read it . Even if you zoom in the browser it is nothing but blurred lines . I have a 32 inch tv and I am literally a foot and a half from it and the words are barely existent regardless of what resolution it is . Guaranteed your tv is n't above 1080 , not that it would matter , and it will look the same to everyone with the same res regardless of actual tv size . Edit : Even more to note is a higher resolution makes things smaller on screen .

1 I watched it with my sister and parents , ( at home ) and after the movie was over we all agreed that it was a waste of 2 hours .

1 If we were to stretch the rules just a little bit , I think any of the diner scenes in Pulp fiction would work because they have incredible dialogue and mostly two people speaking .

1 I think that title has a lot to do with the plot .

1 Were n't they in Prometheus together ?

1 Nope , she did n't feel right for it at all .

1 Jive turkey

1 Aniston has been touted for months as a possible contender . She was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild award yesterday where there are no genre splits to double nominees . Some speculated it was TV actors in the guild that pushed her through but this shows it was n't and she 's likely to get an Oscar nomination .

1 As far back as i can remember , i always wanted to be a remake .

1 How old are you ? Plenty of actors played Batman before Bale . More will play him after Affleck .

1 Can confirm : scene would not have same meaning without it .

1 And that one dude squishes his tots

1 * WHOOSH *

1 Erm ... It 's supposed to be from the killer . He is the one who `` still knows '' . They are not telling themselves that they still know . It 's still a stupid movie title , but for different reasons .

1 At my local theater , that kind of commercial is aimed at small , local businesses , cafes and restaurants looking for ad space . Its actually kind of helpful for the local community .

1 But that is his role ! It is his role to repeatedly say role ! And here it is my role to commend him for being on a roll .

1 Personal taste . That is how I can explain it to you . Why do so many people on reddit seem to think that your enjoyment of a piece of media ( Be it books , films , games or music ) can be altered by someone 'explaining it to them ' . An explanation might help you pick up on aspects of something you missed but you enjoyment is purely your own and that is ok .

1 You can thank the California State Congress . Driving away businesses daily .

1 Same here . I love both the Warcraft series and Star Wars , but if Legendary does n't change it 's release date it 's gon na get clobbered .

1 Not that it was much of a twist anyway . I saw it on a whim and figured out he was crazy almost 20 minutes into it .

1 Let me guess - this is only the second movie you have ever seen ( and the first one was The Lorax ) ?

1 I for one really like the lens flares .

1 They had vacations . I believe in the example the film used , his wife would visit her mother . Characters could also be written out , as was the case with Truman 's father , so they had to be able to develop lives outside the show .

1 Not to be a dick , however its , `` ... one for each of you '' . Seen the movie a hundred times , hehe .

1 > people who complain about that masterpiece just dont understand what it was trying to be You know , you can understand what something is all about and still not like it . I understand what Wes Anderson is all about , still do n't care for his films at all .

1 What was it ?

1 Yep , Spectacular Spider-Man had Osborn working with a good number of super villains .

1 And speeches about why gay people are varelse .

1 I think it was a strategy he fell back on due to being a German movie aficionado / scholar . The story about being in this little obscure film with him and his brothers skiing lends credibility 'because of course only a true German citizen ' would know of something so inconsequential .

1 Not sure if you did that on purpose ... . ? _ ?

1 It was all gay jokes . The Interview was one long gay blowjob joke .

1 Yeah . The stairs in his house are also helicoidal .

1 Hey how 's it going * spanks own ass *

1 hope he 's right with this tweet though . https : / twitter.com / kanyewest / status / 352660785694130176

1 I do n't think a funnier opening scene exists than what Super Troopers did . `` You are freaking out . Man . ''

1 His best part : `` Hey . Fuck yoouuu '' http : / youtu.be / mz5ODQCueP8

1 You should see the first Avengers film because it 's a fantastic film and I do n't know how you 've gotten this far through the 21st century without having done so . However all you really need to know from it is `` these guys were a bunch of superheroes who did n't like each other at first then they became friends to save the world . '' If you 've seen Iron Man , Thor , and Captain America 2 , you 're pretty much good as far as character background goes .

1 Completely agree . It lacked everything that made the first one so great . It constantly felt like it was trying to top the original with everything especially Hit Girl 's character and just missed the mark on everything .

1 I would just like to point out that poster to all those people who whine `` they do n't make posters like they used to '' . That thing is EPIC and my new background .

1 I like to mention the audiobook whenever someone considers reading it . The narrator ( R.C Bray ) does an incredible job . The main character is simultaneously incredibly intelligent and hilariously sardonic , which the narrator conveys really well .

1 While far from flawless , I feel these Marvel movies have been better written than the comics they come from . They more than do them justice overall

1 Do you know the spoiler at the end ? If so , it wo n't be as good ( obviously ) . If not , I think you 'll find it to be a solid , enjoyable film .

1 \ * BOOM\ *

1 Better director .

1 No , that shows why war and PTSD is n't great ... not why Chris Kyle is n't so great . I 'm not theist , but even Jesus is portrayed wondering why his dad forgot him . We all know how that feels but questioning god does n't make the character of Jesus any less saint like . I 'd say the same for Kyle . The film portrays him as a perfect person changed by war . Not a flawed person changed by war .

1 I liked Twilight .

1 I 'm with you . Paul Blart is Die Hard in a mall , Observe and Report is `` What if Taxi Driver was funny ? '' But then it was n't funny , but ended up being a pretentious Taxi Driver knock-off . At least Paul Blart knew it was just a joke .

1 Having read The Hunger Games books ( and enjoying them ) they are similar to BR , but still different enough . And I never ever ever want an American remake of Battle Royale . It would bastardize it and turn it into some version of The Expendables .

1 I felt like a racist after the movie ended , i was suspicious of the robots the whole time

1 The last few have . Since Lego Batman 2 in 2012 I think . Plus we 're getting Lego Jurassic World in June .

1 I giggled when I saw the dino .

1 It 's from the original Simpsons quote .

1 That 's funny because I see it as the US society seen from Forrest 's view , a bit naive and buying into it . If you watch the movie , it 's narrated by Forrest himself and it shows how fucked up things are and how he interprets them . From the incest that Jenny experiences to the reasons why Forrest went to war . We as the viewer sees what 's going on , but he do n't . There are a fuckton of social and political commentaries . If you only understand the movie from Forrest 's point of view I can see why you consider it a propaganda movie .

1 the main character is attacked by Anti-Smokers and they try to kill him with nicotine .

1 I love this movie . I do n't care what anyone says . VFX , the performances , the action sequence and the humor shine . Yeah , they did n't give us the Mandarin with rings ( yes , I would 've preferred that ) But what we got was a non-stop entertaining action flick . What else do you want ?

1 Because it 's there .

1 I plan to within the next week or so ... have to admit , the first two-three viewings ( watched on my own once , later as part of two different classes ) really turned me off to it . It 's a great idea , but ( to me ) the overall idea if horribly executed . Maybe if the main character was actually punished for being an ass , or made some effort to change ... I dunno .

1 He kind of rebooted Nightmare on Elm Street also with New Nightmare .

1 I was hoping that this got released elsewhere digitally , because youtube REALLY is n't suited for releases like this . Especially for a restoration of a long lost video ! Vimeo is far better , and even allows the download of the original video file if the uploaded chooses to activate it . Of course it 's a smaller platform , but I think it would have been beneficial to upload this video to youtube , and upload just the main feature to vimeo ( or even with the intro , who cares ) , or just ANYWHERE we can see it without additional low quality compression .

1 Its a good movie overall

1 He looks like he just tried again .

1 Giving money for art would be paying for a movie ticket . This is giving money towards the production of art ( which in itself is fine ) but without any guarantee of getting what you paid for , and reducing the capital burden of movie studio that will be pocketing the profits should the project succeed . It might make some sense if the people who paid into this kickstarter get free movie tickets when it gets made ... but they wo n't .

1 Kowloon ? Madame Hydra ? Clearly someone was unamused by The Wolverine .

1 Yes , but the good parts are good enough to forgive the imperfections .

1 Why do you think the content of the video was inherently and at-first-look humorous and entertaining ?

1 Monty Phython 's Life of Brian , particularly this bit : http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=QereR0CViMY

1 People who want ownership and not reliance on corporate cloud ; digital property which you 'll never own . Terms of contract can change and licencing agreements . What 's here today can be gone tomorrow without any say from you . I would rather have my disc . It ca n't cease to be because of some lawyers or server woes . Ready to play anytime I want without having to check if I have permission to watch .

1 Believe it or do n't , but sometimes too much footage disrupts the pacing of the movie . If a movie does n't have a good pace , there 's a chance it might lose the audience . This is why the filmmakers take out scenes that contribute bugger all to a movie . Yes , you do n't mind longer movies , but not everyone 's like you . The majority would rather not waste their time watching things that contribute nothing to the movie .

1 * I hunt quail , Jeremy . They 're overpopulated in this region and they 're decimating the grubworm population . You got a fucking problem with that ? *

1 Everything shot in that big red banquet hall looking thing looked incredible .

1 Was cinematic gold .

1 I just do n't like Darren Aronofsky 's movies in general .

1 Do n't give Lucas any ideas ...

1 Can we all just agree that `` X-Men 3 '' and `` X-Men Origins : Wolverine '' never happened ?

1 If he can get a solid 'stache going I can dig it .

1 I think the most unprofessional thing a film critic could do would be to wipe his ass with the celluloid and dance into the street screaming Madeleine Kahn quotations .

1 This movie is excellent .

1 It 's also based on a popular existing franchise , as opposed to being a fairly high-concept original idea that might be hard for people to get into ( i.e. Firefly and Dollhouse ) .

1 All of Nick Nolte is NSFW

1 Everyine has an M over their eyes , this does not indicate cable was in dofp

1 Yeah , it 's definitely a thing . Was the first thing that stuck out to me when I watched it . Also , your note at the end is n't really true . Yeah , ADR is used quite a lot but it 's not 'most ' whatsoever .

1 This may be part of the reason why it was n't as good for you . I 'm completely serious . You kind of * have * to see it on a reasonably sized screen , with a really good sound system .

1 as long as people continue to like fast cars , beautiful women , and large explosions , this series will continue .

1 I do n't know . He was excellent in The Social Network and Never Let Me Go . I 'm curious to see how he turns out in one of his first serious movies as a dramatic lead .

1 Radagast the Brown is attacked by a shade wraith wielding the blade at Dol Guldur . Radagast picks it up and brings it to Gandalf . Gandalf presents it to the White Council .

1 * ( Edit : The deleted comment asked OP to name one good horror movie made after 1990 . ) * The Descent Silence of the Lambs Audition Paranormal Activity The Blair Witch Project The Ring Both you and OP are falling into a `` le wrong generation '' -type trap .

1 If you ca n't tell the difference between * Fury Road * and * Transformers * , then the problem 's not with the movies .

1 Michael Snow

1 Dooo itttt . Life is too short to pass up new movies , haha !

1 I 've never been a fan of 'Braveheart ' , yet it seems generally well liked . I do n't get it .

1 That 's the only one I thought the remake did better . The hand getting `` startled '' looks kind of silly to me .

1 No , they mean `` WoW movie '' . LOTR may have inspired WoW ( as well as damn near every other fantasy realm created since LOTR ) , but the entire feel of WoW , from its aesthetic to its storytelling style , is so vastly different from LOTR that you ca n't justifiably call it a rip-off , either directly or implicitly .

1 Godzilla . * HA ! *

1 It 's because I never even bothered to watch them .

1 In a certain way.. = )

1 I 'll try and forgive him for making 'The Pacifier ' . But I worked in a video store when that came out and it was the title of the week . I saw it more times than is humane .

1 `` Bow to the Queen of Trash ! The Queen of Refuse ! Boooo ! ! ''

1 I have a feeling they will show up , likely very briefly , at the end of the film . The legend of Prometheus is that he stole fire from Zeus and gave it to man , so Zeus punished him by tying him to a rock and having vultures eat his liver every day , only for it to grow back and repeat for all time . The Aliens are gon na be the vultures , the Space Jockeys are the gods . I read about this in an interview a while ago , but I can not find it anywhere now . I think maybe someone gave away just a bit too much info .

1 Obvious troll is obvious .

1 Armin isnt Azn

1 Michael Bay does not in any way , shape or form own the mecha genre . Giant robots have been destroying cities since before power rangers . This movie owes a lot more to mecha / monster anime than it does to Michael Bay .

1 Yep , just to expand on this , that community lives in a world that ripped away pretty much every concept associated with free-choice and creativity like color , choosing your job , music , etc . At the beginning you 're not really told any of this so you naturally assume their world is pretty similar to ours other than the fact that they 're more controlling . Then the main character notes that this apple he says `` changes '' , but we as the audience do n't really know what that means . As the story goes along one of the biggest reveals in the book is when it 's revealed that the `` change '' the main character sees is that the apple changes from what everyone else sees , which is presumably black and white , to the color red .

1 My friends were pissed at me for a week for actually showing them that movie

1 You have to look at it from a different perspective than most movies . 1st , it 's a beautiful and slightly tragic love story , there was little spoken dialogue but the body language The Driver used spoke volumes to me . And do n't even get me started on the chemistry between him and his lady friend ! Then throw in a bit of boot-in-your-face violence and an amazing soundtrack and it 's enough to keep you on the edge of your seat .

1 `` discuss ''

1 It definitely seems the type to benefit from word of mouth , but each passing weekend decreases the studio 's profit , and word of mouth is n't as massive an influence as people would like it to be .

1 She blew my mind in The Master , great performance as a matriarch to PSH

1 See the original post for part of the answer . I do n't remember the exact wording but it seemed like Duncan was pushing pretty hard to make MUTE , which was meant to be Moon 's prequel . Do n't know how far along he actually is though . Would n't divulge any details on the third movie .

1 I was going to respond with this as well . I saw it with my girlfriend a couple nights ago and had a blast with it ! I do n't understand why it is getting so much hate . : /

1 it 's still December 2014

1 Nerds sure love to confuse `` plot hole '' with `` part of a movie I did n't like or understand '' .

1 Haha . kids . he gave it a positive review . Also long , though .

1 That 's pretty late into the film 's production ... it 's pretty easy to see that the title `` Muppets : Most Wanted '' was sort of shoe-horned in ...

1 Grave of the Fireflies

1 There 's always that guy

1 One of the reasons Alexander was unpopular in Greece was that he tried to import some of the `` god-king '' traditions of the Persians . So there 's that .

1 I do n't know if I 'd say it sucked , but it was most certainly very average .

1 [ Yeah , I read that there was n't much Batman in the movie . I might go see it again this weekend and try to time to see how much Batman there really is , but I 'm sure I 'll forget . As far as weapons , I think the emp gun was the only new gadget and that was brief . A few scenes of Batman gliding would have been nice . Spoiled by TDK ( gliding and grappling ) . ] ( / spoiler )

1 Yep , that 's the ticket .

1 Yet it 's quite possibly the most well known movie in that category ...

1 The Avengers movie , in my opinion , was pretty corny . So I preferred The Dark Knight Rises .

1 I came here to say The Thin Red Line .

1 Because it 's a movie of many different parts . Some of which work , some of which do n't work .

1 you 're correct , but since you are comparing the two , you know what i meant .

1 Wash : I definitely have to say it was her legs . You can put that down ! Her legs , and right where her legs meet her back . That - actually that whole area . That and - and above it . Have you ever been with a warrior woman ?

1 Intergalactic Arthropoda just do n't understand

1 ? _ ? I have to ask , when did you see it ?

1 I saw `` Dickface '' as a meta-metaphor for Franco 's hyper-sexualized identity . The primary instrument of his art , his face , vitalizes his sexual potency as face-shaped genitalia . He reveals this literally in his `` Dickface '' character . I kept thinking : this is art !

1 Because it 's what Steve McQueen would have done . Who does n't want to be like Steve McQueen ?

1 Yeah , my `` to-do '' list .

1 What a time to be alive .

1 or his brains coming out of his head right towards you !

1 Yes , but she was n't used very much . I think everyone in the film did a fantastic job .

1 No , but it probably had oranges .

1 What a piece of junk , : )

1 There 's more than both , comics should follow the theme and tone of their source material , guardians did , TDK trilogy did , and Avengers did , I think its part of what makes them great movies .

1 Most legitimate answer in this thread . It 's getting more and more disappointing every year when the category is swamped with people who wrote down real events . * The King 's Speech * was fantastic , but writing * Inception * from scratch is just a completely different talent and should be recognized as such . You could actually make a solid argument for the acting categories as well . Best Actor / Actress has basically become Best Impression . Creating a character and performance with all its mannerisms , vocal qualities , reactions , etc . out of thin air is drastically different from watching endless videos of somebody and then trying to do what they did in a way people will recognize .

1 Kinda your fault

1 Movies did n't change too much , just that we are n't all still 5 when we watch them .

1 Geez / u / Flutterwander , it 's a satire !

1 aww , but she got poked in the eye ! That was the best part !

1 Ever see Following ? I saw it the other night . You may like that one a little more than his others .

1 I spent $ 8 to see a line of dialogue . Worth it .

1 If you mean 2010 was the worst year because the lack of Christopher Walken . Then you 're correct . EDIT : Autocorrect

1 He is a gigantic * radioactive * lizard . I 'm not sure he has the same nervous system or respiratory system as your typical reptile . Theoretically , would also need an unholy amount of nerve agent .

1 I do n't understand why Transformium is so funny . We have some dumb / simple chemical names in real life . Transformium is a practical name given its context .

1 You showed a lot of tact by not naming the board and hence creating an unstoppable flood of newfags .

1 This song get 's stuck in my head all the time too !

1 After Hours was n't already on coke ? Damn , look forward to seeing it .

1 She already shot a topless scene for The Breakup , but it got reframed so you did n't see her breasts in the movie . A still has leaked , which kind of got confirmed as genuine when the studio issued a takedown notice .

1 It looks like it , I 've read a bunch of reports that have said he 's using the high-pitch : Daniel Day-Lewis is a devotee ' of the `` method '' style of acting , a process where the actor * becomes * the character he or she is portraying through extensive study of the character 's writings , thoughts , mannerisms , etc . Supposedly Day-Lewis has been `` in character '' as Abraham Lincoln since filming began . Even off-camera , he still uses the same thin , high-pitched voice Lincoln was known for . Additionally , the script apparently does n't list the actor 's name ; it lists him as Abraham Lincoln . [ Source ] ( http : / abrahamlincolnblog.blogspot.com / )

1 Seriously . It 's been two and a half months since Frozen .

1 you could say you hated the story and premise but to say franco did a bad acting job is douchey .

1 Fuck .

1 Do n't forget The Iron Giant and Ratatouille ! Both are incredible movies

1 He was pretty funny in Hot Rod imo . I do n't like him personally all that much but I really like that movie .

1 Yeah very similar . This one 's even funnier and airheads was my favorite movie when I was like 12

1 They probably re-skin them pretty often , with * human * skin ! ! ! I 'm spooked .

1 whether you like it or not is one thing , but its definitely special .

1 I disagree . I think the third movie shit the bed with that whole `` Check out these cool new YOUNG actors '' thing . Nobody wanted that . We wanted to see 80 's and 90 's action stars kick ass . If anything , Mel Gibson saved the movie from getting too serious .

1 They took a villain who I absolutely loved and destroyed her . Fuck that movie .

1 Shadow is Baldur . Mr Wednesday mentions how Thor killed himself .

1 Do you know how far removed today 's British accent is from how it was three hundred years ago ? Now how long ago did the Romans live ... I think your sources * might * be wrong

1 * lamp

1 Since he was a part of the supersolider program , his metal `` bones '' ca n't change and his super healing was enhanced by the program as well . He can never have normal bones and most likely will always have a faster healing rate . He can be `` cured '' of his other mutations but probably only temporally .

1 Lone Survivor is actually a pretty solid film . All of the supporting cast were superb and I felt they really stole the show .

1 It is an autobiography that depicts the war through Chris Kyle 's point of view and shows the events he was involved in . It is n't going to include a very broad spectrum of things that happened in Iraq that he was n't involved in .

1 If I had to guess , you could probably compensate for average lower temperatures with increased greenhouse gases . The bigger problem would be the fact that Mars is relatively tiny and its core has solidified , leaving the planet with no magnetic field to prevent its atmosphere from being irradiated by solar radiation ( hence why it has practically no atmosphere ) . I obviously have no idea how advanced the terraforming technology of Zod was . If he could somehow liquify the core , then Mars would have been fine . If not , what about Venus ? All he 'd need to do there is thin out the atmosphere a bit . About the same size as Earth , still molten in the core .

It 's a bit like when in a story , the narrator wakes up and it was all a dream . It 's cheesy , overused , lazy , etc , but sometimes it does work .

1 ehhhh not really . I mean we all know of Tina , Amy , Will , Bill , etc , but they 're just one of a large cast and , deservedly or not , a lot of them do n't make it huge even if they had a ton of potential / screentime in the show ( Rachel Dratch , Chris Kattan , a lot of others ) . That Andy was able to go this far in a short amount of time ( and there was like a year or 2 after he left where he kind of disappeared and did a British show and That 's My Boy w / Adam Sandler ) is impressive . I 'm not hating on him at all or talking down on his work as he 's totally won me over with Brooklyn Nine-Nine

1 `` Engage '' would also be acceptable .

1 I heard he 's next to impossible to work with . There was a story on reddit where the poster , as a kid , had Eddie Murphy shoot a film near where he lived . The poster 's dad gave the movie crews special permission to use their land for trailers and crews and the like . The father then sent around his kid to Eddie Murphy 's trailer with an invitation for the cast and crew to use their pool if they wished , as it was rather hot out . Eddie Murphy responded with a 'fuck off , kid ' . And slammed the door . ... ... the movie trailers soon had to find somewhere else to park , at great inconvenience to the cast and crew .

1 `` Why did you change how you look ? I liked the other way . You should 've thought about how I feel before you changed , STAR JONES . Pretty inconsiderate of you . ''

1 Neither does Rick Ross .

1 And a horror . And a fantasy .

1 You forgot the most important part of Chan 's character : * He do n't want no trouble *

1 It was the only word my brain would put there !

1 Single location ? You mean , apart from that planet they landed on and the alien ship they explored ? Even if it was just on the ship , it would n't count because there are several distinct areas within the ship

1 I genuinely wanted to stand up and clap at the end but the wind down into the credits set the mood otherwise . I want to be clear that I 've always found clapping at the end of a movie ridiculous . This one was worth it .

1 They have learnt english . It is explained in the film . This is not the film . This is a trailer . It is not supposed to explain everything .

1 Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into our side , Chief . We was comin ' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte ... just delivered the bomb . The Hiroshima bomb . Eleven hundred men went into the water . Vessel went down in twelve minutes . Did n't see the first shark for about a half an hour . Tiger . Thirteen footer . You know , you know that when you 're in the water , chief ? You tell by lookin ' from the dorsal to the tail . Well , we did n't know . 'Cause our bomb mission had been so secret , no distress signal had been sent , huh . They did n't even list us overdue for a week . Very first light , chief . The sharks come cruisin ' . So we formed ourselves into tight groups . You know it 's ... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh , you see on a calendar , like the battle of Waterloo . And the idea was , the shark goes to the nearest man and then he 'd start poundin ' and hollerin ' and screamin ' and sometimes the shark would go away . Sometimes he would n't go away . Sometimes that shark , he looks right into you . Right into your eyes . You know the thing about a shark , he 's got ... lifeless eyes , black eyes , like a doll 's eye . When he comes at ya , does n't seem to be livin ' . Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white . And then , ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin ' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin ' and the hollerin ' they all come in and rip you to pieces . Y'know by the end of that first dawn , lost a hundred men ! I do n't know how many sharks , maybe a thousand ! I do n't know how many men , they averaged six an hour . On Thursday mornin ' chief , I bumped into a friend of mine , Herbie Robinson from Cleveland . Baseball player , Bosun 's Mate . I thought he was asleep , reached over to wake him up . Bobbed up and down in the water , just like a kinda top . Up ended . Well ... he 'd been bitten in half below the waist . Noon the fifth day , Mr. Hooper , a Lockheed Ventura saw us , he swung in low and he saw us . He 's a young pilot , a lot younger than Mr. Hooper , anyway he saw us and come in low . And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up . You know that was the time I was most frightened ? Waitin ' for my turn . I 'll never put on a lifejacket again . So , eleven hundred men went in the water , three hundred and sixteen men come out , the sharks took the rest , June the 29 , 1945 . Anyway , we delivered the bomb .

1 Man on Fire is kind of like that .

1 Peter Jackson

1 Marvel comic super-hero , directed by Edgar Wright ( Shaun of the Dead , Hot Fuzz , Scott Pilgrim vs The World etc . ) , could be fun .

1 He really does n't look too bad for being almost 70 . And holy hell , Arnie is almost 70 .

1 Thank you

1 The Matrix should be there if this is about the 90s - early to mid 2000s which most are . `` Drive '' is the lone exception and it has a modern 80s sound . It 's been years since I 've heard a good soundtrack that offered something new . The Hunger Games does n't belong there .

1 Except we are the target audience so we can say whatever the fuck we want .

1 Parts of Chronicle were cool . Parts of Chronicle were n't cool . Parts of Chronicle were terrible .

1 it was only $ 120 may i might add . I bought the Official PlayStation 3D Display , not only do i use it to watch 3D movies but i also use it to game , it retails for $ 500 , i would say i got it for a steal .

1 TIL that you can read the IMDB trivia page for a movie .

1 They were little shits , I bet no one really gave a fuck if they were dead or not .

1 It was extremely noticeable in the scenes with Barry this season

1 And that 's ignoring all of the deadly auto collisions , etc . happening within Metropolis and around the world at the same moment . No one person could save * everyone * .

1 I would rather watch all 3 Twilight movies than this shit ... ..wait I 've already seen all 3 and they were much funnier than this will be .

1 There 's going to be a stinger at the end of the credits linking the film to the world of Dragon Age ...

1 I think it 's allright , it 's rather discret and fits well . no doubt john powell soundtrack will be there for the main scenes .

1 I 'm thinkin ' Austin Powers .

1 I agree 100 % . Also , people look to much to the script and dialogue when a lot of his story is told visually . He storyboards everything himself and basically makes a comic-book version of the script before shooting . He 's also a great photographer . A lot of his storytelling is with visual metaphors , with dialogue serving as a secondary delivery .

1 You ... do n't seem to understand how marketing works . Why would they flood the market with advertising for a movie little more than four months away and divert attention from another one literally just a round the corner . If anything , * that * would be shooting themselves in the foot . This is literally a repeat of last year with guardians . One trailer comes out . Giant pause for first movie ( CA : WS in this case ) to run its course . People fret over the movie not getting enough attention . The movie releases and does just fine at the box office . If anything , the Marvel label will pull people into this movie , so do n't you worry .

1 It 's true . They mock the fact that we want a motivational badass alarm clock , but they raise hell if they do n't get their shitty `` Navy Seal '' thing . Pathetic .

1 Fantastic film . So bizarre and funny .

1 yep , seen it several times on release . never understood the hate for that film

1 What year is it again ? When I think of Germany I think of good soccer , good beer , pretty castles , and luxury cars .

1 None of these are movies which is what the topic asked for . You love many directors . Surely you have specific recommendations .

1 You 're right , I updated one of the movies I missed and I did n't correct the percentage , thanks .

1 Yeah , its actually weird watching a show that is this good , right from the start . If they keep it up , it will earn a place in TV history alongside the big classics like The Wire , Breaking Bad , or Game of Thrones . Anyone that is n't watching True Detective yet , go start .

1 > I 'm sorry , but apes ca n't slaughter a bunch of men with guns . It just does n't make any sense . Most movie premises do n't make sense and suspend belief . I go into movies wanting to be entertained , not try and figure out of the plot is completely plausible in the real world . This movie presented it in a way that made sense in the movie 's world . I mean come on , there was a miracle drug that suddenly cured alzheimers that turned an ape into a genius that could talk . So , of course a lot of these smart , extremely strong apes could overrun people with guns .

1 Superman get 's more props because the origin is expanded in a very nice way . It 's integral to the main plot . It 's like Batman Begins , where it fills in a lot of the story around the heroes loss and main journey . Amazing Spider-man though was very redundant and we could have actually had the same plot without the special origin . Like you could have began it from the events of Spider-man 3 . Something like Green Lantern , the origin was quite stale and probably got in the way of the story , The Incredible Hulk tells the origin in the first few minutes but it really is an origin movie in that we see the origin of Banners power and a mirrored transformation in Blonsky .

1 Yeah . I would say that Rodan is good for the sequel ... But a pteranodon may be too close to the bat-bug MUTO M .

1 Why is everyone so excited about this Twilight movie . It looks like something you 'd see during off peak hours on Sci-Fi . Not even rated R .

1 The Ed Wood guy is definitely Tor Johnson .

1 if not for raging bull , the elephant man was the best film of 1980 .

1 But not with Mark Strong

1 Wan na fight ?

1 There are ... no strings on him

1 This is just cute ...

1 Exactly . Avengers also raised the prestige of characters like Captain America and Thor and turned them into household names . It did more for Hulk than either of the stand alone Hulk movies .

1 `` Actually , I am 1 / 16th Cherokee on my mother 's side , 1 / ? Dutch , 1 / 2 German ... . '' `` I will just put you down for White . ''

1 Great call on The Princess Bride . I second that !

1 There are definitely some things they could do with the story that would n't suck . If it 's about taking some interesting elements from the original premise and exploring them , that could be cool . If it 's about shamelessly cashing in on the name recognition of an existing property , that would be bad . The latter is probably more likely than the former , but then any hope for good sci-fi on TV is better than none .

1 Ah man I remember seeing that live and the whole audience groaned loudly when the movie cut to black !

1 I miss that huge arcade . Great selection of pinball , and a few DDR machines had me hanging out there a lot .

1 I think they would go the extra mile and consider things like framing and focus etc..

1 Princess Kaguya is like the story of Christmas in Japan . Imagine if every single year someone did a Bethlehem , 3 wise men , Jesus in the manger movie . EVERY SINGLE YEAR . And then some big name studio like Marvel did one too , but a completely straight adaptation .

1 Seven-year-old Argobast : `` Haha he 's chewing a balloon ! ''

1 He was offered to direct a scene by Sam Raime .

1 Exactly . The midnight showing is for people who are so far invested into the movie that it would be silly not to expect such emotional reaction from them . Hell , I 'd say the movie was very much a success if it was able to incite such a reaction . If you ca n't connect with the people that are waiting in line for 6 hours to be amongst the first to see the film , then you 've probably gone wrong somewhere along the lines . And if this is not the kind of movie watching environment you wish to partake in , then I would suggest not viewing any more midnight screenings .

1 500 Days of Summer

1 That was part of the joke

1 How the fuck , he would know it 's the title of the movie ?

1 Like Father , Like Son ( 2013 ) Tokyo Story ( 1953 ) Tokyo Olympiad ( 1965 ) Tokyo Sonata ( 2008 ) Nobody Knows ( 2004 )

1 It just showed the power of editing . I was quite surprised by how re arranged scenes were from the trailer . Still a terrific film .

1 Who the fuck cares !

1 It 's about damn time

1 I personally love how Crimes and Misdemeanors and Match Point are essentially the same movie from a plot perspective , but are so varied in tone . Just goes to show the same story can be told an infinite amount of ways .

1 I DJed a New Years party at the producer of that movie 's house in Malibu . He had an Audi R8 in the driveway and two , humongous kitchens . The house had a very large entertaining area where we set up . He also had hired an aerialist and three burlesque dancers from Las Vegas . Knowing that this man had made so much money from the Airbud franchise ( and a few other kitschy kid moves ) made me a cry a bit .

1 Oh yeah ? Thanks - that was fun . Bug them to ask me - I 'm not going through the awkward nightmare of asking them myself again !

1 I did n't think much of X-3 from the trailers and then my co-workers pre-screened it and said it was really good . Once I saw it though I was like , what movie did they see ? Such a waste .

1 I came here to post this , and then you did it for me OP . I thought Speed Racer was going to be okay at best , but the Mom 's Speech , Pop 's arguments and musings with Speed , the support they all gave him , and then the final race reminded me of my family so much that it 's one of mg favorite movies to watch when I just want to relax and enjoy myself with my family around .

1 A LITTLE BIT OF MONICA , IN MY LIFE

1 I considered Earthlings to be more of a shock / exploitation film than a documentary .

1 RiffTrax commentary of Birdemic is golden .

1 I think he 's stepping around the question . He totally has no idea what cinematography .

1 It had The Muppets , Sesame Street , AND Fraggle Rock .

1 No ... Ryan Adams . I wish it was Bryan Adams , then at least I could have heard `` Summer of '69 '' at the end of that movie instead of the other song .

1 * `` the numbers just do n't add up ! '' *

1 I knew a guy who was a projectionist and he played American Gangster instead of Bee movie once . You only need to watch the first couple minutes of American Gangster to understand why parents were so upset .

1 This is exactly what I was talking about in the original post . You are being an apologist . Shooting constraints or not , it is a flaw in the filmmaking . You can enjoy Nolan 's movies , but you do n't have to worship him as infallible .

1 yah wahh ?

1 Yes : by listening to his thoughts and changing the designs accordingly ! Simple ! He could 've said something like `` could you make it ... better ? '' I do n't see how many others commenting here are finding Stanley to be in the wrong ! Neither is `` in the wrong '' in my opinion .

1 Making something look `` simple and streamlined '' is way more expensive . The original design was messy and utilitarian , looked like something you could actually see a military adapting . This new one looks like it was made by someone who designs phones

1 This was a mass shooting in a state with a history of it . What about Virginia Tech ? Dude was of asian descent . Same shit , race is n't an issue until you make it an issue . You 've got no ground to stand on because this guy has n't really said much that has been released . All you know is that he 's a white guy with an education . Could the same be said because he was a student in pursuit of a doctorate ? I 'd say the shame and hate is pretty universal for someone who opens fire on a theater . Maybe in your head you feel as if the shame and hate would be worse for whatever reason . I do n't know what race you are and frankly , it does n't matter . He is a killer and deserves to be treated as such . I get your point , do n't get me wrong . People would flip the fuck out ... .initially . If a muslim did it because he did n't believe in Anne Hathaway 's sweet ass in that catwoman suit , the media would automatically report it as terrorism . Then , they can use those few powerful words : 'redacted ' , 'initially ' , and 'mistakenly ' to get out of it . I 'd feel pretty confident in saying that this is pretty big . It 's been reported as national news on a few large sources .

1 I groaned when i heard Wahlberg would be paired alongside Ferrell in a comedy movie . But actually seeing it , they make a great partnership , and are both really funny .

1 Rare as in rarely seen , as you well know .

1 It 's not a matter of smarts , it 's the challenge it SEEMS to be . No one is going to go to the movies with no direction and choose the 3 hour long cluster fuck .

1 I would say watch the whole thing if you can . Even if it 's shit . If it 's a good friend then it wo n't hurt to share in their interests once in a while even if you do n't agree with their taste . Will give you leverage when making recommendations to them . I have a friend that recommends me comedies that I absolutely can not stand but I usually watch them . I did have to draw the line at Big Momma 's House though .

1 Interesting concept , I hope it takes off

1 Seriously . My mind still boggles about how colossally this franchise was fucked up . I was never even a particularly big Transformers fan as a kid ( a little too young for the original series when it came out , a little too old to be into Beast Wars or the later stuff ) , but I still know * about * it , and it 's obvious there 's a great action movie basically writing itself there . Alien robots , who can shape-shift , are involved in a civil war , which eventually brings them to Earth . The back story is all there , established by several decades worth of TV shows and comics . And then Michael Bay gets his hand on the project and does * everything * wrong . To echo the song from Team America `` Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies ! ? '' And before someone jumps in and says , `` Because they 're good dumb action movies , duh '' - NO , THEY ARE N'T , that 's my biggest gripe about them . I do n't dislike them because they 're bad films ( although they are that too ) , I dislike them because they 're unsatisfying * as action movies * . They 're * boring * , and with bizarrely complicated narratives to boot . MacGuffin chase after MacGuffin chase , punctuated with tons of bad melodrama and wince-inducing `` comedy relief '' . All I wanted was robots fighting . Apparently this was too hard .

1 I do n't think he 's saying humor me , sounds more like , `` He must ... he must '' or `` He must ... arise . '' Something like that , but I ca n't get `` Humor me '' after it .

1 Not technically a gangster film , but good nonetheless is [ Layer Cake ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0375912 / ) .

1 This one 's for you baby happy anniversary

1 I still do n't watch scary movies unless she 's really really hot ...

1 I do n't know . The skeleton dancing down that spiral thing for Nightmare Before Christmas was pretty hilarious .

1 I am guessing the studio mandated some kind of `` 3D money shot , '' and that little scene was thrown in just to make the executives shut up .

1 apparently , when he was a teenage actor who demonstrated tremendous talent , he complained about how he was the only person on set with talent ...

1 They were not * his * movies .

1 Hitler did nothing wrong .

1 If you know any of Baz Luhrmann 's other movies , this should not have been a surprise .

1 Er , yeah ... otherwise known as Jonathan Kent - nice guy , I know his son quite well - got my name from him incidentally ! ; )

1 It would be far better as an HBO series than a film . Most book series would .

1 You may want to look up The Manchurian Candidate . Not sure if that was MKUltra inspired or not , but I think it was certainly influenced by the idea .

1 https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=GnHfY09FMis Credit goes / u / ois747

1 I think that 's quite snazzy actually , better than the boring old cover on my DVD version

1 Yet they make 100x more money on one of these movies then you will make in your entire life .

1 You should watch the Avengers , it 's a cool film .

1 I thought the movie was pretty happy but okay .

1 I was n't talking about the Age of Ultron comic , but the earlier series that the movie was based off , or even the newer Rage of Ultron . Ultron was a terrifying villain and his stories had a significant existential / philosophical theme to them . In the movie he was a snarky robot who never felt like a real threat or had any real screen presence . I also expected a huge part of the story to revolve around Tony and his relation with Ultron , but that was also pretty much nonexistent .

1 I very much doubt you 'll even get a shitty cam version within a day of release .

1 The Corona thing was a great callback too .

1 Probably a flop for a few main reasons . One , the pg-13 rating . Two , this is the third movie and mostly it offers the exact same thing as the first two films . Three , there 's too many faces . They added Banderas , Snipes , Ford and Gibson ... . plus a bunch of younger newcomers that I 've never heard of . What ends up happening is most of the cast members are limited in screen time and their dialogue is mostly one-liners . Last but not least , all those explosions and shooting ... . and the only one who gets killed is the bad guy ? You 'd think with a name like `` The Expendables '' some of them would get * expended * . There 's nothing like knowing that one or more of the characters might get killed off to increase your emotional investment .

1 I know I watched the old series as a kid , its an easy way to bypass the whole violence thing by making everyone a robot , I mean look at star wars the clone wars

1 `` Embrace of the Vampire '' where she makes out with Charlotte Lewis . Amazing . What 's more incredible is that they remade it as a softcore and it was * less * erotic .

1 * whooosh ! *

1 The suicide squad is a bunch of DC villains who are sent on a 'suicide mission ' , in which if they are successful they earn their freedom . And batman vs superman . Jesus have you not had Internet for the past year ?

1 I 'm sorry sir , the omelet does n't come with eggs unless requested .

1 Both Star Citizen and Elite : Dangerous support the Oculus . Prepare to drool ...

1 A super black person .

1 Hopefully , this becomes Toy Story 4 adds depth to Toy Story 3 which adds depth to Toy Story 2 which adds depth to Toy Story .

1 Spiderman Trilogy was really good except for the third film .

1 Mine would have to be all the special affects from the movie Lifeforce . To this day I am stunned by how life-like the undead / vampires look . Especially the autopsy scene . Just amazing skill in that scene .

1 This is clearly , just from what little we see in the trailer , a somewhat more emotive and emotional character who seems to have more history and expressed motivation than the Driver ( not a condemnation of * Drive * ; love the flick and the mysteriousness and opaque nature of Driver ) .

1 I was half expecting the font on the Heath Ledger one to be a sparkly gif .

1 His next film is called `` shit I 'll never make but I 'll tell you about anyway '' .

1 He 's left and gone away . Hey hey hey .

1 > 22 Jump Street * high five *

1 Dude , your ass is tanned more than my face .

1 Thank you for reminding me about Martha Marcy May Marlene . I have n't seen that in awhile . I know what I 'm doing today . I think flashbacks are usually ( emphasis on usually ) bad and are just a piss-poor excuse for exposition , but this movie was the exception .

1 Caleb told Nathan that he reprogrammed the lock down procedure to do the opposite . Instead of locking all rooms but Nathan 's , it now unlocks every door but Nathan 's . He intended to lock Nathan in and let Ava walk out .

1 It hardly ever works in any movie . But for some reason , talentless writers and directors think that putting an obstacle in a romance will make the audience automatically care . Its like they 're taking the most basic and surface stuff from Romeo and Juliet . But that wo n't stop them from doing it anyway .

1 Watch don Jon

1 `` You feel my dick fucking your mind ? Well I hope you 're wearing a condom , cuz my mind is dirty ''

1 > Why bring in Peter 's parents if they accomplish virtually nothing , except for the promise that they might someday be part of the series and Peter 's `` destiny '' ? I actually agree with this . And there was footage cut from both films dealing with that plotline so their intentions with the parents are a bit confusing right now . > the uncle ben subplot did n't feel nearly as accomplished as it did in Raimi 's I think this was more of the new film not wanting to retread stuff from the Raimi films . I ca n't blame them since the fist film did a great job with his death . > it seems like the villains in both movies just go `` mad '' versus spiderman 1 and 2 where their trajectories actually make sense and coincide with Peter 's arc rather than just randomly bumping up against it . Except the villains of the first films were just as formulaic . Look at the first two Raimi films : Peter always seems to meet and befriend these passionate scientists , and coincidentally around the time of their meeting the scientist gets powers and goes crazy . Then right at the end they become lucid and realize what they 've done , gaining a small form of redemption . They all go mad in every movie , reboot or not ! Osborn , obviously mad . Ock , his arms talked to him . Harry took the goblin formula and went mad . Brock was influenced by the symbiote . The one exception is Sandman . > It feels like the series so far has been a creative clash between many different visions of what the story is suppose to be about . Felt cohesive to me . You want to expand on what parts clashed with others ?

1 You 're on to something . Masculine Greeks vs . feminine foreigners is a constant theme in almost every Greek play . Other dichotomies the Greeks wanted to emphasize were Greek ascetism vs . barbarian luxury , and Greek militancy vs barbarian trickery , Greek self government vs barbarian servitude , and Greek maturity vs barbarian immaturity . And of course this dichotomy between Greeks and non-greeks is the same dichotomy seen between men and women . In Greek stories , women use trickery to accomplish goals while good men use strength and intelligence , and also women 's rightful place is to be ruled while Greek men participate in government .

1 You sound fun . It was already a big fucking spider , much bigger and it might not have been easily readable onscreen and the lair Frodo and Sam were in would have seemed much less claustrophobic if it needed to be larger to house a super giant spider . Just enjoy it !

1 I guess she do n't like the cornbread either

1 Remade the film later in his career

1 With the villane xXxD00MxXx .

1 Is n't that what I said ?

1 > I have n't read the comic books . So I might be missing something crucial here > But if they 're shooting for `` gritty '' here , at least show a little human reaction to a near-death experience . You obviously just do n't 'get it ' . Cap is a super soldier . Widow is an assassin . Nick Fury is a super spy . Falcon flies around on bigass metal wings . You expect people this hardcore to be pathetic in moments of danger ? I 've never understood the concept of 'crumple like a chump when something bad happens ' . When bad shit happens you work through it , or you die . > This was fairly entertaining at points , but I mean.. the `` the corporation I was working for turned against me '' has been played to death That was n't really the point here . The people of Shield are still good people . They were simply mislead by the faction of Hydra in their midsts . This is directly out of the comic book . As a matter of fact almost everything down to how the people look is staggeringly accurate to their comic book counterparts , to storylines that happened many years ago . Again : name something you think is better .

1 actually 19

1 I was really hoping that one of the new Marvel Netflix shows would be The Punisher . They have Daredevil , Luke Cage , Iron Fist , and Jessica Jones in development , but I felt like Jessica Jones would fit better in Luke Cage 's show . However , I know a lot of people are really looking forward to a female superhero finally getting her own solo act , so thats cool and all . Putting her in Luke Cage 's show would make her feel secondary , and more like a basic love interest whereas developing her in her own show makes her more independent . I just felt like Punisher would work really well with these `` street level '' heroes on Netflix .

1 You 're the exact reason why they have excluded his name from marketing .

1 Sounds great . But does anybody else wonder why we have to keep making remakes of movies from the `` olden days ? '' Oh , whatever : /

1 I think its just strange to see this kind of sex in a theatre setting . The difference between this and an r rated sex scene is night and day .

1 Cube is a great film . I do n't know what you 're talking about . It gets schlocky around 4 / 5 of the way through but ends on a great note .

1 That was a perfect ending to a rare PERFECT movie . Damn I need to watch that now !

1 Just as long as no kids have you in them I think we 're ok .

1 I loved under the red hood . Bums me out they took it off netflix .

1 The Tree of Life really did insist upon itself . That movie was such a bore .

1 Yeah now I really want to read the books and am wishing for film sequels but it does n't look like that dream will come true anytime soon . : /

1 I think I liked it a bit too much..

1 Because honestly it would be hard to sift threw who is a genuine victim and who just regrets being part of that culture . And by culture , I mean the whole Hollywood casting couch culture . A lot of people come to Hollywood specifically because they want to party . The appeal of fame IS the party lifestyle -- the craft of acting is a side pursuit . I can guarantee that some people came up through this side of the business , and if they 're successful , will probably never admit to it . Others , who thought it would bring them fame and did n't , will spend a lot of years regretting it .

1 American Psycho . It had me begging for more so I went on and started watching tons of different movies and then I fell in love .

1 It 's a * little * bit darker . What with the decapitated head puppetry .

1 what ?

1 And in the end , he just gets an authority figure to spout off his message , because he 's sick of dealing with metaphor .

1 Fits too . Moscow is an awful airport .

1 Usually I can only stay at the theater for two movies then I 'm ready to leave

1 I felt the same way about Simon Pegg as Scotty in the new Star Trek movies before I saw them . He didnt disappoint . Im sure Charlie wont in this either .

1 It 's ok , no one else did either .

1 [ Ladies , please contain your orgasms . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / zpzQO1c.gif )

1 I thought he 'd surely get nominated for his role in Rise of the Planet of the Apes . Dude is insanely talented and constantly getting robbed of well deserved recognition .

1 Which is why I 'm satisfied he 's playing a character like Rick Flag . He 's not really important enough to warrant somebody like Hardy .

1 The camera work in that movie is so perfect for horror . A scene comes to mind where the priest is talking to the mom in the kitchen and nothing happens but the way it 's filmed just brings a sense of dread .

1 I like this list , Fearless was really good . Definitely in my top 5 Jet films . A tale of two sisters and the remake were both brilliant too .

1 Dodged a bullet too . He wanted to make Shadows of the Empire . Fuck that .

1 I dunno , this movie is bound to cause many a Macolyte to huddle up with their Ipads and cry . This film is the truth and does n't paint Saint Jobs in good light . I 'm surprised they are airing this right after his death . You end up rooting for Gates to fuck him over because he beats the sociopath at his own game .

1 He really does n't look that bad . All would be good if he got just lost the gut .

1 In an alternate universe : > Singer : We 've released the first official image of Jean Grey and Rogue ! > bonquisha : Fuck Rogue , she does n't even exist in this time period , how about you stick to the source material and give us Jubilee instead of rehashing old characters ?

1 True but thats because you can hide a trailer

1 Old post I know , but I just watched it . I thought the same thing , but they were on Mars and in cumbersome space suits , I do n't feel it was too unrealistic in that regard . What bothered me more than anything was just genre blindless , call them fucking zombies . Also why not communicate to Nasa or whoever that they are zombies , not a simple 'virulent virus ' or w / e . Let them know what they are dealing with in case it came back to earth . Otherwise though what exactly were they supposed to use ? The closest thing they had to weapons seemed to be gas / oxygen canisters which they could beat them with ( and risk getting exposed themselves in the process ) .

1 Overall the whole film is filled with classic car chases ... some of the best ive ever seen

1 I think the reaction when he got the role was more along the lines of , ? If he grows a beard how will we tell Tony and Rob apart ? ?

1 Ouch .

1 That looks fucking awesome .

1 Thor 2 was dumb , but fun . I mean you have to go in with your brain turned off because none of that shit in the movie makes sense .

1 I was too busy going `` it ca n't finish now , what happens next ? ? ! ? '' To worry about the run time

1 wrenthereaper is a really great guy

1 He definitely used the religious theme of young , desperate , vulnerable and uneducated people following a charismatic leader to their death . IIRC bin Laden would sponsor orphanages , how easily do you get recruits out of that ?

1 > any superhero movie That 's a large category to make generalizations about .

1 I 'd see it two times ... Hey Utah ! TWO .

1 What an asshole he was , good actor though .

1 Well I guess it 's a matter of opinion . I like Zach and is movies . He has that artistic style that makes comic books real . I just was n't a fan of the ending , whether he needed to change it or not . However , it 's not my only gripe , but overall , I thought it was a good film . I thought the actors were fantastic and everything stayed relatively close to the comic .

1 good direction does n't always make for the best movie . Life of Pi was an incredibly complicated story considered unfilmable . To have directed it ( structured it in a way that was accessible ) to the esteem it received was a phenomenal task . However , it was n't as enjoyable to most as Argo was . But ! As enjoyable as Argo was , it was n't the most difficult thing to direct . Let 's face it , every sequence in Argo has been done before in other movies . Now this year was very unbalanced , because dozens of award shows gave Best Director to Ben Affleck , yet the Academy did n't even nominate him . Whether they collectively think they screwed up , or whether they genuinely did n't think he directed the movie very well remains unknown .

1 Joseph Campbell would like a word .

1 Yeah instead of coming out of her vagina he just teleports out .

1 Really ? I felt that both of Chrisoph Waltz 's characters in Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained were excellent , highly developed characters . Especially King Shultz .

1 or Midnight in Paris , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ( although that might not count even though it has surrealist imagery )

1 Heh my showing had an unofficial intermission when the film stuck and melted on the projector . Took them about ten minutes or so to sort things out before they began running it again . It was both a blessing and a course as a ) I needed to pee very badly so a break was welcome but b ) it happened just as the Doolittle raid was getting interesting . But other than that I do n't recall a proper intermission .

1 Yup . Just like Vince Vaughn movies .

1 one of the reviews say that she is there to prove that the hero is n't gay

1 Well said

1 The start of TE2 , they had a helicopter shooting at them while flying around , then the camera cuts to a 50 cal that they had mounted on their jeep . Did they use it to take out the copter ? Nope , flying motorcycle crashes into it and takes it out . That 's when I knew it was going to be good .

1 Hohoho jokes on you Mancreep ! There 's more wall under the grass ! !

1 Toy Story yo !

1 And yet , as a defender of the film put it : `` blame the hate on people being unable to genuinely engage a robot character '' . You know , instead of all the other stuff you mentioned .

1 Well , the first suit did take a tank shell .

1 While that scene probably would 've been of questionable good judgement in filmmaking , even the Raimi films * did * kinda flirt with this : his transformation into Spiderman - iirc - was accompanied by bits of dialogue like `` I 'm going through a lot of changes right now . ''

1 The Road .

1 Yes , many of us , myself included , did n't know this box set existed . Thanks to this post , I have ordered one for myself , hence the Upvote .

1 The Truman Show is one of mine as well . I think it 's aged especially well , in part because the premise of the show is starting to feel more and more real , given society 's rapidly growing love / obsession with `` reality '' TV .

1 You 're kind of missing the point . You absolutely can have a `` weak '' female character . There 's nothing wrong with that , by itself . Where it becomes a problem is when a character is seen simultaneously as `` weak '' and `` normative '' . Mean Girls does a great job with characters like this ; All of the `` bad guy '' characters in the movie are incredibly weak , shallow , and frivolous girls who have power / notoriety solely due to their appearances . And they work * great * as characters there because they are treated as a strange anomaly of pubescent life . The naration never tries to portray them as the golden female standard . Quite the opposite , it paints them as true misfits disguised as `` normal '' . On the other hand , your typical early disney princess was fairly shallow , vapid , and 2 dimensional character who was thought of as a desirable persona . It 's the context around these characters that matters . Not the trait taken abstractly . You can do the same thing with racial issues . In Django Unchained there is an unabashed honesty about the fact that the black characters are less educated than the white ones . However , this is not a statement about the intelligence of all black people , but is rather put into a context that shows that it is a result of actions beyond the control of those characters . In contrast , the stereotypical crows from Dumbo show up entirely as inflammatory stereotypes with no meaning on context surrounding them . The result is that one of these movies is insulting while the other is not . TL ; DR : Context matters .

1 Right . Angier ( the one we see talking ) is never sure whether `` he '' will be the one in the box or the one in the prestige as he says . The assumption is that once he is cloned , his continence is identical at the moment . Then one of them is beamed up to the balcony and the other falls to their death . But he is n't sure which is which . When he is confessing to Borden that is the suffering he describes . To know that each night he could be dead .

1 Yeah , this is one of those movies where I could have done * without * any romance . Do n't get me wrong , I love a good romance subplot but I feel like this particular movie would have been much stronger without it . The action and storyline itself was so strong . Maybe if it was Sif / Thor I would have been okay with it , but Jane / Thor was just generic and cringy .

1 He 's a big comic book fan . He and I had a lengthy discussion about watchmen once

1 The original , Italian title is `` Ladri di biciclette , '' which is plural . International movie title translations rarely have meaning behind them other than what works best for marketing . If I had to guess , however , I would say that Americans wanted to market the movie as a story about the protagonist , while the original authors wanted to focus more on the theme .

1 The end of The Prestige got me pretty good . That reveal and the sequence showing it throughout the film was pretty fantastic .

1 With visuals too please .

1 Yup .

1 Agreed , though in Roger Ebert 's review , he does say that Andrew ( the Tom Hanks character ) is an overly perfect person , to the point where the film starts to feel manipulative . Which is why I thought Dallas Buyers ' Club was a better movie , as the lead character can be a complete asshole - just like people in real life .

1 Up voted for this . Time crimes is brilliant and has absolutely no flaws from a time travel point of view . Primer s another that is worth mentioning

1 Look up the special features on the Psycho bluray . A french company has developed a special program that helps separate sound elements from a mono track , which can be later used to create discreet surround mix in whatever format you may need in the future .

1 They were both entertaining . This is the End , the one with Seth Rogen , made me laugh considerably more .

1 Yeah I needed some other grown men to cry with me !

1 It is , IMO .

1 It was genuinely all over the place . This scene is just part of the quilt of madness of it . Some of the performances are practically unhinged which I can only presume was because the actors did n't know which direction to take things .

1 Well , it 's not modern due to the fact that 1995 was 17 years ago ...

1 I would fully agree with you if I felt like the show or the novels were buying into it and just killing off characters to appease bloodthirsty fans , but I feel like both mediums have done a good job of avoiding that . I mean , of course some people are just watching the show to see who dies next and are disappointed when everyone survives for an episode , but in general I feel like lots of people come for the unexpected deaths , and stay for the actors , writing , production values , etc .

1 so , write a great original screenplay or shut up .

1 And why is the protagonist wearing street clothes while his superior officer is decked out in military uniform ?

1 As a kid , my absolute favorite show was Star Blazers . I for one am looking forward to seeing how this comes out .

1 > Thunderbolt and Lightfoot . Very unique and underrated movie . Excellent pick . Surprising ending too before you remember this was a 70 's movie

1 Best : Fight Club Worst : The Bourne Legacy

1 ... this is in the album on the link already

1 Incredible is n't it . It 's as if it were some kind of meme used over and over again .

1 The camera looks away from the Joker for a second and shows his victim 's henchman grimace at the sight of his boss being murdered . I like to believe when the camera moved away to look at him , the Joker moved the knife down and slit the throat . A trick Nolan probably used to keep the movie PG-13 . That 's my two cents on it anyways .

1 The Crow ? THE CROW is the movie you think should n't be remade ?

1 You 're not wrong ...

1 I would say : Go watch Chris Cooper in almost everything he 's been in .

1 My favourite will always be Desperado We all know he likes to shoot fast and cheap , but lately it feels lazy . Main complaint is the truly terrible CGI blood in his current movies . Go back to squibs .

1 Yes . It 's a 2 hour special in the seventh season and it was amazing .

1 Sorry you 're getting downvoted . This seems like a totally reasonable answer to me .

1 Talk about pretentious ... I do n't see anyone in this thread complaining about this trailer lacking in intellectual stimulation or anything of the sort . They 're only complaining about the film looking disappointing . They 're allowed to have opinions . I 'm certain most of these people ( if not all ) are perfectly fine with turning their brain off just to have fun . Just because this trailer was n't indicative of a film that they prefer to see does n't mean they 're incapable of doing such a thing . As another user pointed out , this is the sub that LOVED Dredd , which is pretty much the perfect movie to turn your brain off and have fun with .

1 he was acting in an M. Night Shyamalan movie that came out AFTER unbreakable , thats torture enough man .

1 What does this have to do with the acting ?

1 Especially since major players will be filming Civil War and everyone else has a movie at some point too

1 This is true and it 's funny to think that you 're doing more damage to the business if you sneak in candy than if you sneak into a movie

1 Funny story : I taught the two little girls im babysitting the hide an seek game with clapping from the trailer for The Conjuring ( without a blindfold , that would be dangerous for a 5 and 7 year old ) . Now im scared as fuck when I got to their giant two story house at 4 am that im going to hear that fucking clap somewhere in the house or right by my head . I really did this shit to myself .

1 You think every successful director in the world can act ?

1 Just to address one of your points . Has he really put on * that * much mass ? At least over 15 years ? If he does anything it 's when he cuts because that 's where the ridiculous part is .

1 * Both had characters who were becoming too old and weak to do their job , despite the fact that their origin story was just two movies ago . * Both villains have the same superpower : the ability to magically put bombs wherever they want . * Both films are a bit more fantastical than their grittier and more realistic predecessors . * Both films are great .

1 Seconded . Tom Cruise plays the villain so well . He should play the villain more often .

1 People must not be clicking on this link because this should be the top vote . What is amazing about this is how SLOW it is : there 's no quick cuts or ramped-up speeds .

1 Emma stone stood out more to me . Superbad came out 7 years ago and she 's still graduating high school

1 Star Trek 2009

1 von Trier films are heavily character driven and laced with archetypal and metaphorical nuances . The question that von Trier asked is what would happen if you put a nymphomaniac and an asexual of the opposite gender in a room together . The result is both being put in an awkward sexual position . Seligman being told this highly titillating tale awakening unfelt sexual feelings culminating in an awkward sexual advance , on the one hand . On the other , is Joe reaching a catharsis with her own untamed sexuality , and being put in a situation where , she always the aggressor , finds herself now the victim , and a psychotic break ensues , whereby she shoots him . As the audience , we also do n't know if he dies .

1 They 'll probably have Nazi gear with them since they 'll be in the moon . I wonder if they 'll do anything at all with Commies though since they hinted at them being on Mars , perhaps for the next sequel ?

1 he 's probably pissed he was n't cast in the super bowl commercial .

1 YOU 'RE GODDAMN RIGHT !

1 The scene is 218 frames long . One of the frames took over 132 hours to render . ( At least , that 's what I got from it . )

1 RocknRolla . Really nicely presented story

1 John dies at the end .

1 Maybe his movies would make more money these days if they * did n't * add his name above the title . Just sayin ' ...

1 The neutrinos , they 're mutating !

1 And apparently it was n't supposed to be a sequel either . At least not as much as it ended up being .

1 ... or really , any of it .

1 It 's kinda ridiculous how they managed to turn the longest book into the second shortest film of the series . I wish they made the Ministry of Magic sequence longer and more climatic Edit : The Order of the Phoenix is my favorite book because it 's so dark and rich in it 's themes . The film felt so empty , hollow , and really rushed to me . I still enjoyed it , but it was still disappointing .

1 Ok the clap at the end got me . Time for new pants !

1 THERE WAS A FIRE FIGHT !

1 > Let 's get J.J . Abrams to produce and direct it . Let 's not .

1 Online movie critics are the worst , they are so far up their ass they ca n't comprehend how people have different opinions .

1 Absolutely one of my favorite films . Both gorgeous and hilarious , though it can get a bit erm preachy

1 You should ask for your money back .

1 I thought it was really forced . They could easily have gone for a straight forward redemption story for Elsa and not had any true villains . I though suddenly making that guy in the end the villain was a bit clumsy .

1 I think that the worst thing that 7-9 can do is be average - not prequels horrible , but not originals great . The original movies were always good in their own right , but it was n't until Lucas started ruining everything that the fanbase got defensive and self-assured in how awesome they were . I wager very few people were analyzing how Han shooting first was a definitive part of his character before Lucas redid the scene and sparked * that * whole controversy . The prequels were * really bad * , but , in a way , they did us an underhanded favor , because the badness of the prequels gave Star Wars fans something to unite over . If the new movies end up being just alright , it might very well kill the franchise by not giving us anything to be passionate about . But hey , I 'm no film buff .

1 Except most people never believed in it . Many defectors have said people just treat the stories about Kim family as analogies / personal legend , and just act as they 're supposed to . Just because they live in North Korea does n't mean they 're dumb . And fun fact : many of the outlandish tales NK 'teaches ' to people that reddit love to talk about , like Kim Jong-il hitting hole in one , have * never been confirmed to be told in NK by anyone from North Korea , not to mention a Korean source * .

1 Add `` The Quiet Family '' and `` Sympathy for Mr . Vengeance '' and you really get to see his range . He 's a very versatile comedian-turned-actor and plays anything very well , from the funny bumbling idiot to .. well , anything else . Definitely one of my favorite actors .

1 That it 'll have a big opening sequence is n't exactly a spoiler

1 Ha , yeah , that 's just as bad .

1 > I 'm ashamed to say that any movie poster that features a woman 's bare ass ( or underwear ) is an automatic watch for me . That 's ... kinda sad actually .

1 Just bought one !

1 You mean I might have to make small sacrifices to make my children happy ? Fuck right off ! !

1 It 's pretty subtle , but I like it .

1 I wanted to love it , but it just does n't keep my attention . It 's boring . The jokes are hit and miss , Kida is dull and it 's hard to care about her relationship with Milo . Overall , I just found it difficult to connect with the movie . And I was biased in its favour going in . I recently watched it again , having built it up in my head as a good movie . And again it was a disappointment .

1 We got ta get this car off the road ! You know cops tend to notice shit like you 're driving a car drenched in fucking blood

1 I first saw it on an old tv in the 80 's off of VHS . When I watched it again on a 50 inch wide 1080p plasma , the mistakes were glaring . Also , in the 80 's there were maybe 3 wide release sci-movies a year . Out of that there might be one good one every few years . We were a lot more forgiving then .

1 That 's Road Warrior too , though . Until halfway through the film , Max only had 2 lines of dialogue . If anything , Max was more proactive in Fury Road .

1 Spooky night bat

1 I 'll second that .

1 Well deserved . This franchise has come a long way . It 'll be interesting to see the weekend report .

1 According to him , it was n't possible because cooper could n't possibly have the skills and endurance to spin the ship properly . Robot miscalculated coopers abilities .

1 Shut up , Big Ben .

1 This is a very typical response I see , that they get paid millions of dollars so they should be happy and shut up . I find it kind of ignorant , to be honest . They went for a craft they enjoyed , acting , and got rich and famous while doing it . Fame , however , should not be people camped outside of your house 24 / 7 hoping to get a picture of you doing something questionable . Fame should be meeting and greeting fans , yes , but unfortauntely , they can not turn it on and off . It should not be their responsibility to hide from the world if they just want to be normal and go shopping . They get paid that money because it is a lucrative business when you 're at the top . They do not get paid millions to be judged constantly and strenously by the public every day . It is not a natural state of mind that millions of eyes are on you at all times . This was not Travolta tweeting about how bad he felt and how we should feel sorry for him , he understands , like other actors , that it comes with the territory . That doesnt stop us from saying `` Yeah , it is kind of fucked up that we judge them to death and public perception can change in the blink of an eye '' . Look what happened with Christian Bale , how much backlash he received when he was just caught on tape yelling at somebody . That must be a hard life to live for decades . Whether or not standing down from `` blockbusters '' would help is beside the point , and I think its unfair to say `` Welcome to the life , you deserve it '' just because they went after the best moves for their career at the time . It 's easy to say `` Smile for a picture and make someones day '' when you think of only doing it for that person . Imagine having everyone you see , doing it all the time , every day of your life . It gets rough , and to say `` Whelp , they 're rich , do it and be happy '' is , in my point of view , kind of an ignorant thing to say . Not to say that having the power , as a celebrity , to do the slightest thing and make someones day isnt an awesome power , it certainly is . I love hearing stories about Tom Hanks kidding around with a waiter , or Christian Bale taking that family to Disneyland ( which is actually a pretty big deal , but still ) . It 's a great thing to be able to make people so happy so easily . But lets try to see the other side of the coin here , its easy for you to get a picture and walk away . They cant really walk away . Didnt mean to sound abrasive , just conversating .

1 Way too intelligent to be trained . Wat . Intelligence can only help in a matter like that . If people can get bears to stand on a ball when they clap their hands , they can certainly communicate with raptors .

1 I did , Upvotes to the left .

1 Successful maybe , a faithful biopic , probably not .

1 What do you mean `` resembled ? '' His swing * was * an alligator snapping its mouth closed .

1 Oh man . When the final act started and `` it really did happen '' came on the screen , my breath caught in my throat and I was vastly uncomfortable for the rest of the ride ( a good kind of discomfort ) . That movie was a total trip . I should watch it again this week . Thanks for the reminder !

1 If you skip to 2:09 you 'll see a bullet whiz past and leave a hole in his hat . It happens really fast , but it 's a pretty sweet detail once you 've noticed it . Other than that , you 'll have to suspend your disbelief .

1 the directors cut added nothing and took away so much . Those stupid comic book style cuts between scenes angered me no end .

1 Yes but Culkin did a great job .

1 Looking back , Neo suddenly flying at the end seemed to come out of nowhere , but it was a strong punctuation and other than that the ending is awesome , imo .

1 Ca n't really argue with that . It was already mentioned as the definitive Western Parody . I guess Airplane could claim the Thriller / Drama Parody sub-genre ?

1 The Special Collector 's Director 's Unrated Edition Cut of * Return of the King * . By the end of it he 'll have had enough that he 'd probably storm out because he 's too tired to kill himself tonight .

1 What was stupid about it ?

1 Lots of movies rated R are not like this . I have n't seen it yet , but I read the imdb parent guide and read things here , damn it 's basically porn with a good plotline .

1 In fairness , the author actually addresses this point . So he 's at least aware of the flaws of the list .

1 Looks good . I 'm glad Radcliffe did n't get typecast as Harry Potter .

1 He also won an oscar for that performance , and I would say it was well deserved .

1 It was cringeworthy .

1 I just want to ... suck your cock .

1 A sacrifice fly will not count towards your batting average if a runner scores . So if a guy has 3 plate appearances - two hits and a sac fly - it will be recorded that he went 2 for 2 . It 's supposed to reflect more honest stats because it 's a `` tactical '' maneuver . With a runner on third and less than two outs , a ball hit high into the outfield usually can allow the runner on third to tag up , and then score .

1 Yeah , THAT 'S why Three Stooges bombed .

1 No problem with rants at all , I loved reading that . I think it 's very possible there were undertones of Adam and Eve , and I 'm not sure how I did n't catch that ! As for Nathan working out , I think that may have just been boredom ( what the fuck else are you gon na do in the middle of nowhere ) but I still think all your points are solid , and anticipate looking for them in the movie whenever I watch it again .

1 You mean [ this ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=emgeMj13cxg ) Batman ? Yes , he occasionally smiled and laughed . He also smiled and made jokes in the Nolan series . Alfred : I suppose they 'll lock me up as well . As your accomplice ... Bruce : Accomplice ? I 'm going to tell them the whole thing was your idea .

1 Yup .

1 Movies ! = comics

1 If you speak two languages fluently you would know there are things that are much easier to say in one language than another . I speak entirely in English but when I am talking to someone that knows French as well I often switch in the middle for certain things .

1 Princess Leia 's ship fleeing past the camera firing desperately back at something off screen and then just as her ship is getting far enough away from the camera that you think maybe they 're successfully escaping , that star destroyer comes blasting over head . . . and keeps coming . . . and keeps coming . . . and keeps coming . And even though you do n't yet have any idea who 's in that first ship , you know that they are royally fucked .

1 I just watched this on youtube a few weeks ago , and man alive , that was horrible movie . And the filmmakers seemed to earnest ...

1 They were a hate group . Most likely to have violent , repressed urges .

1 Same . Honestly while the storyline is weak , what immerses many people into AVATAR is the franchise itself . Pandora is amazing : http : / hebus.org / files / Movies / Avatar % 20Pandora % 20wallpaper % 201920x1080.jpg

1 Indiana Jones Just adding that if some searches ( incorrectly ) they will find this .

1 That 's not what OP is complaining about at all . You 're trying to change the subject .

1 I wonder if OP also thinks that Spielberg wrote the screenplay and came up with the plot ...

1 For your viewing pleasure . https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=CnTltDzqhzM

1 Maybe the point is , those reasons were crap . True , but still crap . The show did indeed show Matt giving a crap when presented with a reason that is n't blatant cowardice or greed , such as Gladiator 's .

1 Because nobody ever has someone say 'Hey , you should go see & lt ; insert movie title here > ' or hears about a movie that sounds like it might be interesting , or gets dragged to something by someone who is a fan ... Edit : I 'd also like to point out this was at a * film festival * , where people frequently go to see things they have n't heard much about beforehand . It 's not like this took place at a commercial theatre during wide release .

1 Alien .

1 Slappa da bass !

1 This is awesome , many thanks

1 It also fits with the way Christoph Waltz stated he approaches his roles [ here ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? & v=j3b2dH6n3Qg # t=698s ) . When playing villians he likes to try to internally justify their actions , and also show there positive qualities . Likewise with `` good '' characters , he likes to also expose parts of their dark side . He finds that duality the most interesting . Perfect match , no wonder Tarantino thinks so highly of Waltz .

1 [ Schindler 's List ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0108052 ) , [ Inglourious Basterds ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0361748 / ) In that order , it will thoroughly make you hate Nazis , then you will be able to see them die graphically , very graphically . Spielberg then Tarantino , what more could you ask for .

1 Theres also American Dream / Xanadu being built in NJ . Theres also a mall at the new WTC

1 I 'M ON VACATION ! ! !

1 > I 'd love to see it be remade though . Take your right hand and extend it flat . Now rapidly bring it into sharp contact with your cheek , near the corner of your mouth . Thank you for your cooperation .

1 The first and second graphic novels are bloody great . I especially liked the second one with the whole War of the Worlds thing going on .

1 Gon na find my baby , gon na hold her tight Gon na grab some afternoon delight My motto 's always been , when it 's right , it 's right Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night ?

1 They must not have counted the cardboard cutouts .

1 That movie is such a trip .

1 I think it 's because a lot more than just white paint is involved .

1 Not really , they are quite cringe inducing .

1 I really ca n't get why someone would watch a dubbed anything . It breakes the whole experience for me with all the bad lipsyncing .

1 You want AON ARERRAHHHHAAA RUUGGGG .

1 That 's impossible , * I 'm * Darth Revan

1 Stunty post is stunty .

1 I did nothing . The pavement was his enemy .

1 You 're an idiot .

1 Paul Thomas Anderson is in my opinion . Or the Coens .

1 Christ this movie is so many levels of deep . I feel like this is exactly what the Steven Spielberg AI movie should have been . I can totally see the Kubric-esque themes and pacing in this film too . Just bloody perfection .

1 The looping sonar-like wail definitely gives it a creepier vibe . Also the trailer does something that is a rarity 30+ years later ... it does n't give away the entire movie plot in 2 minutes . In fact , were you to watch this trailer in 1979 , there 's every reason why you would be hooked -- it does n't even show the alien . You 'd leave the theater thinking wow ... gon na have to see that to find out !

1 It 's basically what reddit means when they say `` I wish it was rated R ''

1 Read it like this : > `` If it was [ Holocaust denial ] , you can guarantee people would have been outraged ''

1 `` The Chernobyl nuclear power plant melts down , causing a spike in premature mutant expressions for generations . '' It says it right under the picture ...

1 Yeah , but his mom 's a piece of work .

1 Problem is they wo n't make Blade Runner . They 'll throw a bunch of money at it and it 'll be layered with CGI all over the place in a tacky way . Hell , they wo n't even make the Matrix , they do n't know how to control themselves visual effects-wise anymore .

1 Jack and Jill

1 I 'm not . I fucking loved This is the End .

1 im a huge marvel fan , and have enjoyed all of the films , even the less liked of the lot . Avengers i found one of the weakest ones . it was terribly overrated for what it is , and i think is just popular for its extreme budget . it brings together a large ensemble cast , focused too much on robin from HIMYM which i thought was a poor cast choice , has one of the weakest villians of all the films . Loki didnt require an entire team to topple and the alien invasion felt cartoonish . they just dropped like flies . at no point was the avengers in any real danger of failing . I do however have high hopes for age of ultron

1 is that one of the Police Academy movies ? It looks liker Hightower and Hooks .

1 The MPAA has nothing at all to do with the federal or state governments . I agree it needs to be let go .

1 God bless France .

1 watching the Cap 2 one , just seems to be condescending , whiny nitpicking - not really analysis .

1 Dredd

1 Ohhh ... yeah.. I was n't thinking.. blanked on white going first .

1 It 's my film and I 'm also Canadian ( dual citizen ) . Trust me , I 'm disappointed too . Doing everything we can to get international distribution deals right now .

1 My wife thinks so also , which means the world to me : D Thanks !

1 Imagine Adolf Hitler at the Nuremberg Trials ... his crimes are read before the judges ... murder of 6 million , invading countries all over and causing destruction , civilian deaths , theft of art , etc , etc , etc , and his defense says , `` but he saved his own son ! '' AQUITTED ! Hitler is later paraded as pop-culture hero ... because he saved his own son ? Really ? Fuck George Lucas . ( By the way Dorothy did n't have any control over a house being sucked up by a tornado , so you can go fuck yourself too ) .

1 Could n't have said it better myself . These crappy Hobbit movies are just a stint by Hollywood in an effort to get more money out of our pockets , and in the process they are destroying the story .

1 `` Your punishment must be more severe ''

1 Because celebrity worship . These people decide a person 's entire character based on some Q & A videos and `` That person was polite when answering questions , and they made a joke about falling up the stairs '' turns into `` That 's why Jennifer Lawrence did n't care if she fell down , things happen and life goes on but she 's clearly not worried about hiding behind some false 'perfect ' image . '' I mean , yeah , I 'm sure she 's a nice person and all , but I really do n't understand writing all that based on some TV interviews and stuff . Reminds me of some celeb who was always carrying her baby away when paparazzi showed up , then some ignorant women met her and said `` You should n't carry your baby everywhere , it 's bad for his development ! '' It 's kind of annoying how people idolise celebs when they 've just seen them in answering questions and being polite then going off about `` she 's clearly not worried about hiding behind some false `` perfect '' image . What we 're seeing are people completely comfortable in their own skin. '' To me , anyway .

1 Or they should let the users decide like how the rest of their site functions . Good concept though .

1 I want to see it . Everyone wants to see it . But I do n't want to see it in little chunks so nothing is left to be revealed . Am I really alone in this thinking ?

1 Yeah , I 've heard him multiple times say that he wanted to do something inspired by TDKR or just do a straight up adaptation of Year One . I believe his interest in doing Year One was what caused the next Batman movie made to be an origin story .

1 Go watch Snatch . Right now ! ! ! !

1 At this stage in his career I 'm thinking highly unlikely . But a reasonable thought for lesser `` big '' names .

1 I completely forgot that Sean Connery is the father of Harrison Ford . AWESOME . Shame that Shia LeBouef is the grandson in that situation though , sort of ruins a good thing .

1 This is n't true and it 's pretty much spreading fear and hate mongering towards an entire group of people . There about as many Palestinians who would kill every Jew as there are Israeli 's who would love to see every Palestinian dead . And honestly , there are actually very very few of either group who wants to see the other dead .

1 Your bravery is off the charts . I 'm so glad we have people like you to impress everyone here on the Internet .

1 Yeah , the architecture is super Moroccan . I think it 's just a case of the art / story directors picking and choosing to get that fairy tale feel .

1 Yes , because when we are talking about the craft of actors , we all think of * Megan Fox * in * Transformers * .

1 This is where you curse his sudden yet inevitable betrayal .

1 Weak ? So what ? Hoffman 's 'memory ' is more about his film work , his fine performances as an actor - his art . Look deep enough into * anyone 's * lives and you will find a pathological mess , a lot of shit .

1 Inception actually has a good bit of scenes like that towards the end if the movie , when they use a van to go three dreams deep . They 're really well done .

1 It 's true . Serenity / Firefly is endlessly quotable .

1 Pitch perfect is n't really a musical .

1 I 've heard about it seemingly forever . The idea is that you watch them back-to-back , Apocalypse first . Before I was married my future wife and I did it ( original cut ... it was before Redux ) . It accentuates the darkness and helplessness and inevitability of the Wonka tour . The movies are bizarrely similar , except for the endings . The exuberant ending of Wonka is fitting , after 5hrs !

1 http : / youtu.be / Ssn2GGNVF0w This video explains a lot of why the movie is the way it is . Worth the watch

1 I think it 's fair to have different standards for different types of movies . Some critics will pan every blockbuster action movie because it because it 's not high art even though the blockbuster did n't set out to be high art . If Fast 7 's goal is to be 2 hours of dumb fun and it accomplishes that goal then scores / rating should reflect that .

1 The movie definitely stole from other movies , particularly Moon . It felt like a combination of Moon and the Terminator franchise . The hints of the end were pretty obvious although not entirely initially clear . I would n't say the acting was dull and boring , it seemed OK to me . It was n't as forced as Mission Impossible 4 , I did n't think so anyway . The ending seemed rushed and not well thought out given the investment the viewer puts into the movie . I think the action sequences were good , and generally I felt the experience of the movie was great . It 's not oscar worthy but I enjoyed it much more than I expected to after reading the reviews .

1 man im so excited for this movie . i want to kiss peter jackson . he 's made half of my life awesome by getting the chance to see his kick ass movies . ca n't wait to see whats next ! !

1 Except Marky Mark . I think that 's why it 's one of my favorites . Not the MM part , the everyone dies and the good guys kinda win part .

1 That does n't make a lick of sense . We 're voting on the Academy Awards , that 's what they 're called .

1 In general , any movie with 3D in the title has sucked . That someone thought it was a good idea this time , blows my mind . I 've always just called it `` Dredd '' .

1 They needed a spectacular action shot , and either you 've read the book ( so it 's not a spoiler ) or you have n't ( in which case , `` ooh , look , something exploded ! `` ) .

1 Effects budget : 100 million . Actor / talent budget : 50 million . Writing budget : eh , we 'll make something up .

1 Thought you might be going with [ this ] ( http : / youtu.be / 1Wh2CruhrKk ) .

1 The best summary of this movie for me was `` it 's ok , but all the adults are the exact same character '' .

1 As opposed to the other foot chase in that movie ?

1 To be , or not to be ... : :lights cigar : : Not to be _KABOOM ! _

1 It was decently entertaining but never something I would have thought would be a movie . The book is basically a textbook of magical beasts with writing by Harry and Ron in some of the margins , there 's no plot at all ... It sounds like Rowling is writing a completely new plot about the writing of the book for the movie though so the book is n't likely to be that relevant anyway .

1 Hell yes , and thank you for saying it . There are two things I never need to hear again in any reddit / movie discussion : ( 1 ) lens flare and ( 2 ) wilhelm scream .

1 You should watch Infernal Affairs

1 The Name of the Rose . Murder mystery in a Medievil Italian monastery starring Sean Connery .

1 I agree with you on that . I think it was a really good adaptation . It 's probably one of my most watched movies ( and I still have n't seen the ultimate director 's cut ! ) I like the changes the film made * for the film * . It fits with the movie . Something does n't have to be better , which is why a lot of people who have read and watched Watchmen hate it . Because the comic went into much , much greater detail about the world , characters , etc , everything in the comic * fits for the comic * . Some people just do n't understand that .

1 He clearly had great fun , the result being that I did as well .

1 The 3D for Ultron was poorly done . I 've seen some fantastic 3D presentations and this was not one of them .

1 Tony motherfucking Montana

1 For anyone who wants to avoid spoilers , this is their summary : > There are a few inaccuracies and exaggerations in `` Gravity '' , but the movie premises are sound and many physical principles are honored , which greatly enhances the quality of the movie experience . I highly recommend the movie . Short of watching actual astronaut footage , this is as close to space as you are likely to get in the next few years . It may even prompt you to investigate the promise of space tourism .

1 That was really difficult to finish . Shit like this that makes me think `` yeah ... I could sell a screenplay ''

1 Lupin the Third , fuck yeah . Having him voiced by Solid Snake in the Manga dub was a masterstroke of casting .

1 They did make a Metal Gear Solid movie , It 's called Metal Gear Solid .

1 Well it 's not an unpopular opinion with me . I could n't stand Lost in Translation either and I do n't think Anderson would have helped it any .

1 You 're not wrong , couchlocked , you 're just an asshole . ( see ? anyone can do it )

1 Hey ! I 'll have you know that `` Chinese Democracy '' had 1 good song on it and 1 other song that I learned to like because my ride to work listened to the album everyday for 2 months ! So take THAT !

1 Yep , I 'm hoping one day they will make the Automated Lawnmower & human hurdle an Olympic event one year .

1 Not over yet , just because he did n't get best director does n't mean he ca n't get Best picture and Chiwetel Ejiofor can win Best Actor . Gravity truly deserved for director , that opening shot all done with one camera , come on man .

1 The empty chamber was foreshadowing Supergirl , or someone else in the Superman family . Wonder Woman has a completely diffferent origin .

1 Seems like they really did n't give a shit like they did with the first . It 's like they just gave up early and hit cruise control

1 I loved what they did with Star Trek . It was perfect to me because as a newcomer to the franchise I felt welcomed in even without hardly any knowledge of the lore and yet at the same time to keep the hardcore fans happy , that universe still exists and can still be explored further . It was a `` reboot '' done right , and fitted the film perfectly . Star Trek is one of the only franchises lucky enough to be able to pull that off perfectly .

1 Anyone else thinks he looks like a fatter , sadder and much more heavily armed Russell Brand ?

1 Bale was an amazing Batman , but Keaton was the stronger Bruce Wayne . Absolutely .

1 Ah , thanks !

1 that 's the dark humor of it

1 I believe it said specifically that the raccoon references were provided by `` Oreo and friends , '' which I took to mean that Oreo was one of the stunt raccoons used for references when animating Rocket .

1 His name has been associated with Deadpool for so long now it 's nice to finally make it official . Here 's hoping he kills it .

1 I would n't call tricking your captors an `` escape '' . He convinced them that it would be beneficial for them to let him go . He had proof of his occupation as a bounty hunter in his pocket , and the slaves in the carriage corroborated his story . They had every reason to let him go . Their one mistake was giving him a pistol before he held up his end of the bargain .

1 Yeah , Jeter did n't really have any great adversity that needed to be overcome . Now , if the Yankees had won the World Series this year , you could have made a film about the ageing superstar returning after an injury to win in his final season . Unfortunately , that did n't happen .

1 `` You come in here , dressed like a hobo ... it 's distracting . ''

1 Go on ...

1 Not when you are an actor . Think about that time you saw your crush and pretended to have an interesting phone call near her . No matter how good you think it sounded , it was probably really unconvincing and would have been a LOT better if you had a buddy on the other end feeding you lines . Same concept .

1 and Sin City and Planet Terror .

1 Yes you can , just watch Evangelion .

1 It 's more than just that . Wright unsheathed a plethora of horror and cop film references in his first two features , that ridicule the structure and also pay homage to at the same time . It 's more of an act of reinforcing the staples of the genre , and his referential nature reminds me of why I love movies so much in the first place .

1 > '' I 'd be surprised if he was n't in his own movie in the near future , or introduced in another movie first . '' Seriously , he was introduced so poorly in Origins ( introduced might be the wrong word , since he was only molested by the ending ) that Stan Lee 's just ignoring it .

1 This thread has achieved its goal .

1 Are you saying the director - the guy directing an X-Men movie with the word `` Future '' in it - is lying about them being in it ? Not to mention it 's based on a beloved saga of X-Men canon that specifically deals with the future ?

1 Looks pretty good to me .

1 The Apartment ... is so fucking good .

1 Not sure if sarcastic , but those two Undisputed 's are generally considered pretty good action movies . After 20,000 votes on IMDB , III actually has a 7.5 rating . Seems crazy , but they are n't completely terrible !

1 Yup big big big inspiration .

1 It has n't been getting good reviews , 30 % on Rotten Tomatoes currently

1 You totally sparked my curiosity . So i fired it up and thumbed through it . I could only find this outfit in a single , 4 second scene . After the sequence with the Jones boys in the car against the Nazi P-2 pilots we go to the Nazi 's acquiring supplies and vehicles for there journey into the desert . Right after the king / sultan whatever goes on at length about the Rolls , Donnovan walks past a flight of stairs as Doody walks down and says `` We have no time to lose , Indian Jones and his father have escaped . '' The next sequence with Doody is in the desert where she has a completely different outfit complete with goggles . that 's the only place i could find it . EDIT : All i can think is maybe the dress is somehow significant outside of the movie .

1 Or maybe a Netflix series ? Could be a good addition to their whole `` we do original shit now '' shtick .

1 He obviously has a great sense of humor about himself ( the running joke on Jimmy Kimmel , appearance as himself in Jay & Silent Bob movie , et al )

1 hey , nice username

1 While you can argue nepotism for her role in Godfather III and maybe for getting her first movie made , the quality of her work speaks for itself .

1 Here are my recommendations , in order : * Philomena * , * Saving Mr. Banks * , * Gravity * , * The Butler * , or * Captain Phillips * . Did you mean what 's in theaters or on video ? These are in theaters .

1 When I read the book I did n't try to follow it so much as just ride along . Loved it . I have no idea what happened though .

1 Pearl Harbor - was so glad when they started bombing as it was a boring film up to then .

1 I agree . Not to sound cliche , but prior to 911 there was a sense of `` freedom '' , the world seemed safer and that things were getting better . Then 911 happens and a sense of dread permeated all media . There was talk of constant fear and how our lives were in danger . The innocence was lost . That for me was when the new millennium began .

1 You got it , downvoting .

1 I did n't downvote him , however his phrasing does come across as if he 's stating an objective fact in order to tell someone their opinion is wrong .

1 The chase scene is outstanding . The fight in the mansion after they find the keymaker dude is also great . Actually I think those scenes flow right into each other .

1 NOW YOU 'RE A MOIAAN ! MAN ! A MOIAN MOIAN MOIAN ! NOW YOU 'RE A MOIAAN ! MAN ! M-A-N , MOIAN ! MOIAN MOIAN ! NOW YOU 'RE A MOIAN !

1 How would that work , though ? They could n't leave , there were soldiers outside . They were pretty much stuck under the floor and even if they knew about Landas real intentions they could n't have stopped it .

1 Eve Muirhead .

1 The Mummy films are perfectly comparable to Indiana Jones films . They 're in the same genre , they 're in the same setting , they 're set around the same time , they deal with similar themes and have similar characters . And obviously they 're both influenced by the same films . There are rarely such films that can create such good comparisons as The Mummy and Indiana Jones .

1 Fargo

1 I went to the premiere and actually enjoyed it . It plays longer than the actual running time but the script is pretty good . It 's fun , light , entertaining . Really cool VFX . Atmos sound was bitching . The ending was meh but the ride up to it is enjoyable . It 's a fun movie . Solid B .

1 > Even Lord of the Rings had the writers scripting on the fly , although that was more dialogue changes than anything else . This is an incredibly common thing . Most big productions are going to have a member of the writer 's guild on set to clean up lines and work out scenes that just do n't feel quite right when it comes to shooting .

1 Yeah that was bad . But I forgive Snyder because he showed some Silk Spectre nipple action there ...

1 or how much more

1 I think people have to keep in mind that it 's rarely one or the other . I think each approach benefits from working in tandem with the other . I loved what we got out of our animatronic lion back in the days of Jumanji but would n't want to try to make it leap down the staircase and run down the hall the way the digital lion did !

1 Nope ! You 're mentally superior . Congratulations .

1 Oh my lord , when will people just accept that this movie is polarizing and that not everyone shares their opinion about it ?

1 I know , it 's awesome right ?

1 The US government uses terrorism as a boogeyman . Sounds like they got it spot on .

1 Ohh I 'm sorry . Your finger must be really sore .

1 Those were different movies ? ! ? !

1 Throughout most of the film I was just pissed off at Sandra Bullock . [ ] ( # s `` She kept panicking and breathing a lot , you started out with 8 % oxygen left , calm the FUCK DOWN . But the scene where she has a hallucination of george Clooney she redeems her self . She had been on autopilot , not living , sense her daughter had died . But she decided to live at that point . Suddenly it felt acceptable how she acted throughout the movie until that point . Basically , I thought it was a good tale of redemption . '' )

1 Indeed , the D9 movie universe is fresh new content , a cool mix of ghetto junkheap scenery / tech and gleaming super-harnessed alien battletech . It stands totally on its own , apart from the Star Wars / Trek style movies or the sifrivolous `` Battleship '' / `` Tom Cruise vehicle '' / `` Total Recall '' sci-fi movies . Imagine if Wikus was transported up to Thomas , cured or semicured of his conversion , and taken around the local galaxy `` neighborhood '' , visiting space stations or other places . In today 's cinema output , that 's as close as you could get to a `` Mass Effect '' -style movie . But if it were smaller scale and intimate like the first one , with only Prawns and Humans having known habitable planets , I guess that could work too .

1 Oh man you 're so right .

1 I FUCKING CARE

1 NO IT IS NOT . Good on you .

1 Boredom is a power not to be underestimated .

1 I think they were going for some rennaissance style artistry , what with the hand postures and books all being important symbols to convey certain messages . Seriously , go to a museum or gallery with a bunch of rennaisance art , notice how Mary tends to either have an open book or a white lily ... It all means something , and I 'm sure someone with a degree on the subject could fill us in on all that ... I 'm curious as to whether the artist copied these poses and items intentionally while knowing their meaning - which might or might not apply to the character depicted - - or was merely copying the art style to project that mentality , in that sci fi chicks should be as revered as Mary by their fan bases .

1 Definitely one of `` those '' movies . I do exactly the same thing .

1 Jaws . The book is fucking * terrible * .

1 You might want to slap an NSFW tag on that .

1 > Am I the only person that liked X3 ? Yes > I felt like X3 had a lot of really exciting and interesting moments . The whole is less than the sum of it 's parts .

1 He went toe to toe with the Hulk for half an hour or something . But the Hulk kept getting angrier / stronger then Stark gets his ass beat

1 Same with Rumblefish , was n't the lead but great movie .

1 I think a strength of his films is how they work on a shallow `` That was fun '' level but also have a lot more beneath if you want to see it . Lots of people have the fun and miss the rest , and that 's totally fine , but it 's not everything , as you illustrate . I think I just rephrased what you said . Meh . Oh well , leaving it .

1 Thats one way to look at it . Heres another one : Space is meant to induce feelings of awe , wonder and excitement . Lets keep inspiring young people to fight for things like science , exploration and research into the unknown because its a uniquely human trait and we should continue to embrace our ability to travel through time and space .

I guess I 'll have to watch it again since I have n't seen it in over three years . I remember it being nothing more than standard b-movie schlock .

1 I love this film and find it to be underrated . I 've seen it a bunch of times , there 's so much detail and great writing in this film .

1 Those were great times but I have to say , season 5 's storyline , although at a low point in his career , really brought the best out of the cast

1 Son , you just went full retard . Never go full retard .

1 In the book I believe the alien ambassador explains that the device will only work once . It 's their way of inviting new up and coming species a chance to glimpse what is in store for them if they continue to advance . But it 's not an invitation to join their galactic civilization , not yet . So it works once and then afterwards it does nothing . There are checkpoint stations elsewhere in the galaxy that assist the device in sending its passengers across the galaxy . Those stations will simply ignore any further transports .

1 It 's okay for me .

1 It 's interesting though , it does n't seem like he has an unhealthy view of women , just that he does n't understand basic human emotion or how to convey it .

1 I agree on 50 / 50 . Since it had cancer and JGL , you 're naturally gon na like it , but it really was n't anything new or out of this world . Jonah Hill though really did give you a performance that made you feel for the character and he truly deserved to be in the Oscars .

1 It 's always been interesting to me how the strongest fear responses come from a suddenly appearing human face accompanied with an audio cue . It gets you on a primal ambush defense level , I suppose , and gives you an adrenaline kick . Certainly It and Exorcist both understood this , and most horror films do understand the jump scare . But these two films did a better job than most of making you half expect it at all times , creating constant dread and peripheral fear of other signs that might mean it is coming . A lot of that depends on evocative music and sound design , which was way above average for both . The Exorcist was a very early horror film to have that kind of perfectionist attention to detail , and It , at least the first half , was head and shoulders above what you 'd expect of something made for TV . The original BBC Woman in Black is a pretty good early example of the jump scare well delivered and milked for its full value as well . As a kid , the original broadcast of It got to me for days , and still hangs around for at least one nightmare a year . But I loved the book so much , and other Stephen King or Tim Curry , and horror fandom in general , that the first shock was totally worth it . I think every imaginative kid should see at least one good horror film before they grow up too much to appreciate it .

1 Yes , there is ALWAYS a scene after the credits on Marvel movies .

1 Best ending ever .

1 `` My Big Fat Greek Divorce ''

1 I 'll have you know I 've won as many competitive Oscars as Peter O'Toole and Leo Di Caprio combined .

1 Not according to South Park .

1 thanks I was wondering what Japanese abbreviated was ...

1 So what are you saying ? Without great actors playing the main roles and one of the best directors of all time directing would people still have cared ? No , thats what helps make it a good movie .

1 I am not a smart man . Hahahaha

1 I like Michael Bay movies and are not in any way insulted by their existence .

1 I hope so too , I had no idea what the prevailing opinion of this movie was ! I think Connery and Boorman are great , there were just some really bizarre things in this movie ...

1 Can you go further in your criticism ? Maybe what you saw that made you think that they felt satisfied and superior everyone felt . Or , was it more of a general feeling ? I 've never noticed or felt that the movie was pretentious . It 's also been awhile since I 've seen it , though .

1 What an incredible documentary . We had to watch it in one of my film classes , and it just furthered my hatred towards the MPAA . I hope that as technology improves , people will realize that word of mouth in the realm of social media is a powerful thing , and that we do n't even really need the MPAA . We have a local theater that plays unrated films and I think a few NC-17s ( I could be wrong on that ) .

1 That 's Short Round . He made it through the door earlier .

1 The lion king most definitely . Small soldiers errrrrr . I caught it on TV recently and I turned it off quick to spare those precious memories .

1 You 're pretty close .

1 Acts was written way WAY after he would 've lived so should n't really be taken as any kind of historical evidence . As opposed to the Pentateuch which was only written way after he would 've existed and might be slightly more reliable . Or not .

1 He was at least good in The Town and Argo . Not exceptional , but in both cases ( mostly The Town ) he had great supporting casts that almost overshadowed him .

1 > Hostel If your idea of light hearted is a woman getting her eyeball torn out with a blowtorch , then yeah . Fun for the whole family . : D

1 The Incredible Hulk cameo

1 What would that entail ?

1 Did you watch it ? I have n't , so I am not reviewing the quality of it . All I have seen is the trailer , and it looks like one of the better action movies from the trailer alone .

1 TIL that the mongols had 'pilgrums . '

1 I agree with Frozen . My GF took me to go see it and I really did n't expect the movie to be any good . I immediately recognized Idina Menzel and thought she was amazing . The movie was wayyy better that what I expected .

1 I think it 's mentioned on the audio commentary but it 's been a while since I watched the movie with that on .

1 It * was * an actual commercial . Just happened to take place during a movie .

1 well its working . hardy is a fantastic actor .

1 You did watch the scene where he explains the whole scheme though right ? Comments above suggest hatred for the script . ( To be clear , the movie was a bit of a let down to me as well ) I just happened to know about the crimes and story prior to the movie coming out . It may help if you read the true FBI files and watch the movie again .

1 We went all-digital . No more trolling people from the booth . : (

1 Big Trouble in Little China . Hell yeah .

1 warich looked too plastic , and your dont get that they did the full makeup her meryl from young to old in a beliveable human , not a ..one dimensiol , goblin . http : / www.dailymail.co.uk / tvshowbiz / article-2097392 / The-Iron-Lady-How-prosthetics-transformed-Meryl-Streep-Margaret-Thatcher.html

1 The * new * Stormtrooper model : Now with more Lucille 2 !

1 Yeah I 'm not a Stiller fan in the least , but I 'm surprisingly willing to give this a shot . It might just be because the trailer had a good song in it ...

1 Agree . I would also think that people would be more open to working for their meaning ( so to speak ) if this was n't written by James Franco . The internet has made us lazy to the point that we seem to think everything should be gawker level . But , to also be fair to the mob , there is a lot of fluf in there too . `` Enfant terrible '' ? Okay ...

1 All OP had to do was add one word : `` * The * Star Wars Episode VII set in Abu Dhabi ''

1 I do n't want to spoil details , but , to make it quick , defeat from within similar to the Covenant from Halo . The Yuuzhan Vong had an extremely hierarchical society . Doctrine gets questioned , and suddenly you have full-on Civil War .

1 No , everyone has the right amount of limbs . What makes it so terrible is the resizing , the composition , and how painfully obvious it is that no one there was in the same room . And that this happened six times in the same poster .

1 I noticed that , too . I ? ? rritu really put the camera right in the actors ' faces . Very intimate .

1 It 's a French production , but the director is American , so it 's hard to categorize the movie either way .

1 Once did a B-Movie marathon with Age of the Atom theme . Deadly Mantis , Godzilla , and Them !

1 Seeing this , I now want a movie serie where when they reach 10 , the 11th would be called `` And this one is for free '' .

1 And the fact that they 're generally good guys , not just spoiled / annoying assholes .

1 Indeed . I just saw one parking yesterday . That bitch had one hell of a roar even when going very slow speeds .

1 TDK

1 I love the man and all but he really is a drama queen about his hipster art .

1 I think Hollywood has been trying to forget that film for the past 25 years .

1 Indeed . I was a theology major and early Catholicism and Norse mythology were my primary focuses . So of course Tolkien 's works are my favorite fictional pieces . In fact Gandalf and all of the dwarves from Bilbo 's group were all taken from the Voluspa in the Poetic Edda .

1 They were using false names at the hotel , raoul duke I believe , so they did n't know they were talking to Thompson at the hotel , just somebody in his party . The cop saw his actual ID and at the time he was a well known writer for rolling stone , so he recognized him . ( this is from memory , so it might be slightly off )

1 Yeh i do n't even know how I got that wrong . I think I was typing that while staring at my bosses George Costanza poster .

1 well if she hates them because of 'scares ' then it makes sense that she enjoyed this one .

1 BWONG is the British spelling of BWAAAHM

1 Ungoodtastically .

1 Dumb & Dumber - Two Gentlemen of Verona

1 The last thing I remember him in was The Rock as the leader of the Navy SEAL team infiltrating Alcatraz . Smallish role , but a glorious death .

1 You 're really drawing a comparison between Indiana Jones and Interstellar ?

1 For reference , phantom menace was the only movie where he was wearing basic stage / set makeup rather than age-altering makeup . ( the later prequels had some , due to longer in-universe gaps than what happened in real life )

1 My favourite Vince Vaughn scenes in Dodgeball were when he 'd say something really basic and unfunny and let literally ever supporting character be hilarious in response .

1 > But there 's way more to Toy Story 3 than that . More than would be apparent from a plot description , aye ?

1 The reason Tyler was able to capture her from the bus is because there were members of fight club / project mayhem on the bus when she got on it . If I remember correctly , if you look closely after she gets on the bus and the bus starts moving , several people on the bus get up and move toward her .

1 * Looks at number of upvotes before clicking *

1 Actually this is a great movie for that kind of thing .

1 The Hangover Part II repeated the plot of its predecessor more than any other sequel I 've seen .

1 If he wins Best Director , I will never talk shit about Affleck again . Never .

1 Ooh classy .

1 I love the conversations with her , and how she complains about how simple the other Ewoks are . And how she stole a ship to escape the moon of Endor .

1 What about it looks like propaganda ?

1 He 's admitted this problem like a thousands before this ... .

1 The math works .

1 Diversity is important in any endeavour .

1 I 'm willing to believe it 's done intentionally to avoid the uncanny valley .

1 He squinted so much he went blind .

1 You con do eh brudda ! !

1 It was also unbelievably badass

1 A major thing that has to be realized is that not all animation is for kids .

1 `` Right , because I 'm an asshole . ''

1 I do n't if it 's just that films fault .

1 > only military veterans should be the only ones allowed to vote Um , if I may offer a small correction here - Heinlein never states that ONLY military veterans be given the franchise , but veterans of public service , ie , those who contribute to the greater good of a society are the ones best equipped to decide it 's future . If you wish to make an issue with the idea of military veterans being equipped to deal with the complexities of a mutillayered civil society , go ahead - but Heinlien 's book * can * be read as a satire in it 's own right , even if that may not have been his sole intention .

1 But it is football

1 You and I have violently differing opinions regarding high resolution , sir . Cool , nonetheless .

1 First time I 've seen this gif , it may be up there with troy and abed and guster eating popcorn for me .

1 Yes it 's a pretty bad title , a generic tech-y word . Might as well have been called `` Motherboard '' or `` Frontside Bus '' or `` Compiler '' ... How 's that for the sequel ?

1 I do n't mind karma whores . People wanting meaningless internet points gives me fresh front-page content every day before bed . : ) But if you want to become good at something , you need to start distancing yourself from time-sinks that wo n't help you obtain any of your goals . If you play games all day , you need to play less games to make room for learning a craft . Not quit games , because they can actually help you become a better illustrator ( like watching movies , reading books and traveling will expand your visual library and inspire ideas for unique designs , characters and worlds . ) But all in moderation , and Reddit is a hard drug to quit . Even I feel guilty spending so much time here as I do .

1 > '' As for RIFT I felt that was done quite well . You get the feeling in the middle of the movie you should side with them , `` I never forgot they straight murdered a bunch of people , for absolutely nothing whatsoever . Murders that were in no way justified by anything .

1 Fuck , that 's a horrible story . Good to know he was brought to justice . ( putting this here in part just so the comments are n't flooded with stupid rape jokes )

1 Hercules may not be the most accurate , but it is a Disney classic and a childhood favourite .

1 And its all true which makes it even better in my opinion

1 [ Sigh . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? feature=player_detailpage & v=5zh0EiPLCqU # t=5s )

1 [ A bit like this maybe ? ] ( http : / geekleagueofamerica.com / wp-content / uploads / 2012 / 08 / joss-whedon-captain-america-shield.jpg )

1 It 's a great song , do n't get me wrong but c'mon ! Use something different . They even lined it up to finish with the same style archer scene ! !

1 It 's almost embarrassing how much I miss him . I never knew him , but just knowing he was alive and commenting on the same shit I was seeing in the world just made me happy . I remember actually thinking that at times ; it felt like a real loss when he left .

1 Also , a poor choice made by a character , is not a plot hole . Its just a poor choice .

1 The one that came out a few years ago was Tron 2 . The first one came out in the 80s

1 But the 7 Samurai was awesome though .

1 pretty much any movie John Williams was involved in .

1 He actually gave it a `` thumbs up '' review . I guess they just included the quote here because it 's funny , although to me it seems more playful than critical .

1 No shit .

1 I saved you a seat , you fucker . Shittiest one I could find .

1 October 14th .

1 This , and also the fact that in volume 1 there is some pretty heavy antagonism between stark and rogers . by vol 2 its tapped down to professional respect and even friendship , but there is a reason why Stark and Cap are the divide line for Civil war : they are the two that see least eye to eye .

1 Classic Stevens .

1 What 's even more impressive for Pratt is that he did 2 movies this year . Guardians of the Galaxy and the Lego Movie , the highest grossing actor of the year was in a superhero movie that hardly anybody who does n't read comics would have never heard of and a movie based around one of the oldest children toys ever . That makes me strangely happy . It 's Scar Jo that surprised me at first but then thinking about it she was the lead in Lucy which although not a great movie ( imo ) grossed over 400 million worldwide and of course her killer movie this year being the Winter Soldier it 's not surprising that she got a decent paycheck for the year . All 3 well deserved imo , I 'll admit I 'm a big JLaw fan and thought she was great in XMen and phenomenal in Mockingjay and I 've been a Pratt fan since 2005 so its great to see him at the front of Hollywood same with Scar Jo been a fan of her for a long while too . Been in some amazing films .

1 Bow chicka wow wow

1 Well , where the American pie movies try to make the main characters look badass for being so crude and sexualizes every girl , the inbetweeners makes fun of the main characters for acting the way they do , and unlike American pie , they never get the girls because acting like an American pie movie character is a surefire way to show you 're a loser who thinks you 're cool . If that makes sense . It 's like the antithesis or deconstruction ( kinda ) of the typical dudebro college+party+chicks movie .

1 Of all the commercials I have so far watched in this thread , this is the one where I can feel the directors influence the most . This commercial is SO Guy Ritchie .

1 Sorry , got ta nitpick ... `` * Mmm * -hmm ! This * is * a tasty burger ! '' Edit : this , not that .

1 Yes , this is one of the things I fear is vanishing in the cloud of the digital age : Annotations and palimpsests -- the things that reveal * process , * ( especially self-apprehension , appreciation , and revision ) so that humans ca n't kid themselves via hidden editing that their grandeur arrived fully formed , like Athena leaping from Zeus 's head .

1 I envy your wife for getting to see Scrooged for the first time .

1 I about died laughing when Nintendo announced the Wii-U .

1 Most definitely - he also nailed this particular comic exchange in the film as the Secretary of Defense : * Secretary of Defense * : I 'm not Jewish . * Jeff Goldblum 's Jewish Archetype Dad * : Nobody 's perfect .

1 North by Northwest is actually a pretty stupid and incoherent story if you really pick it apart ( Seriously , literally none of it had to happen ) , but it 's still one of the best and most entertaining films of all-time .

1 Well , did it work ?

1 This movie look so crazy . Doubt I 'll miss it .

1 Agreed . All 3 Punishers were good for the role . Too bad all 3 movies were n't that great .

1 The Shining : `` Come play with us Danny . forever and ever and ever ''

1 Okay , I see your point , but it is anectodally the case that posters on IMDB , aintitcool , and the like , were deadset against the casting , up until the second trailer was released . Believe me , I frequented those sites . OP 's tableau accurately reflects the internet zeitgeist surrounding the casting and look of the character .

1 Same here . [ See poster for comparison . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / A6ZUGkF.jpg )

1 I always thought it was funny that there were 10 NJ license plates surrounding the actors ... then straight to MN .

1 Elizabeth Olsen in any movie is a good thing .

1 The only issue is you seem to be mashing two story lines . I think Arthas was in some way a part of the grand plan but Archimonde and Ilidan are involved with the burning legion storyline . So you 'd be seeing demons that the orcs and night elves combine to fight , not the undead menace .

1 Yeah I 'd put Loki in the list of good villains with motivation and background .

1 But the score is awesome . Those bombastic horns transform the ridiculous into awesome for me .

1 > Maybe I 'm cherry picking the comparisons ? Gee , you think ? ?

1 You 're implying he has more than one way of speaking . ^Oh , ^I ^feel ^the ^downvotes ^already .

1 Yeah the hype around Episode I was truly insane . That was the beginning of the waiting in line for tickets days in advance thing I think , which I guess online tickets has killed .

1 They were toying with the idea , I heard . Then it kind of morphed into `` the Falcon gets destroyed and Lando dies , '' which is why Han says that set-uppy line of `` Why do I get the feeling I 'll never see her again . ''

1 If only . That scene in Knightfall with Joker and Scarecrow will always be awesome .

1 Please watch your language . If you cuss too much your soul will be darned for all eternity where you will be mildly uncomfortable in Heck .

1 M night as ... the writer who will change the world

1 It 's kind of a really nice day out !

1 > At a packed Mad Max screening a neckbeard decided to stand and applaud at the end I bet it was one of the mods !

1 Agree . Visually , it was a masterpiece . Most scenes left me breathless . However , the story line lacked momentum , and some scenes did n't seem linked to one another . However , you have to admire this dedication !

1 bullshit . source : confirmation bias .

1 I really liked Django 's first half . After the [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` scene you mentioned I was also a little puzzled . I was saying `` Goddamnit Schultz ! '' You could have just walked right out of there ! Was Tarantino reinforcing the point that white people are stupid ? I felt it made a sort of sense that Schultz could n't hang on to his rage as well as Django , who was playing the 'role ' far better than Schultz , but why , WHY could n't they have just walked out of there on the spot ? ? ? '' ) I put a lot of the problems of the film down the passing of Sally Menke , Tarantino 's longtime collaborator and editor . While the directing is suitably sound , there were a few bits where the scenes feels a little long . There 's a small bit where nothing happens when Schultz and Django talk to the judge , but what was the point of that scene ? My room mate asserts it was to show how Django is incorporated into the bounty hunting business but that does n't make sense , he 's already been in the business for months by that scene . What was the point ? It really bugged me . Although the action scenes were pretty great and the tone fit Tarantino 's usual Sam Peckinpah level of elaborate violence , Tarantino choosing to fit in so many rap songs into the fights yet could not find room for the Frank Ocean song the latter made for the film ? His music choices are usually really spot on , but in this case I felt it was a little more jarring . Largely the hip hop songs felt anachronistic , as opposed to previous choices like David Bowie 's `` Cat People '' in Inglorious Basterds , which was set to fit the scene perfectly , but the weird pacing of Django threw me off a little .

1 Sinister Six

1 In regard to action movies , absolutely .

1 Those are the four I read . Deception Point , Digital Fortress , Angels and Demons , and Da Vinci Code . They are entertaining enough but even high school me was able to see the plots as all similar and formulaic . I think Digital Fortress is the only one that does n't start with the death of a father figure for the female sidekick .

1 Oh my . Thank you for that .

1 I 'm not Red Foreman . I 'd never call a person dumbass without a damn fine reason .

1 This is how time fucking works . Stop .

1 > '' sex is n't inherently 'bad ' or harmful '' - uh , tell that to the thousands of ~~babies~~ unviable collection of cells that we call a fetus but could just as easily be called a parasite given their relationship to their host that get aborted every year , not to mention the grown-ups that get sick and potentially die from ~~STDs~~ shaking hands or being near other sick people ... FTFY . Compare the death toll of AIDs to the Plague , or Influenza , or fuck Malaria ( which is theorized to have killed HALF OF ALL HUMANS THAT HAVE EVER LIVED ) and you 'll quickly realize that even the worst of STD 's are seriously not anywhere close to the level of scariness of other diseases that are NOT sexually transmitted .

1 I CAME HERE TO MARVEL AT AWESOME VIDEOS , NOT TO FEEL .

1 Y-you think that 's a Schwinn ?

1 On Reddit , who can tell ?

1 Spoiler tag !

1 That had bad everything . The only decent thing in that movie was the guy from the daily show and I might just think that because I like the daily show .

1 That 's total BS . He only has control over his movies , and even then , Kevin Feige can veto anything he wants . He does have an exclusive contract with Marvel until next year though .

1 But it was broken by red hot adamantium swords , kind of makes sense that the only thing that would be able to break it would be itself so I let that slide .

1 Black do n't crack

1 Night on Bald Mountain ? * clicks * Yep , Night on Bald Mountain .

1 I do n't think you know what that means . New IPs are pretty much the opposite of a cash grab ( I know it 's a gaming term , but it fits my point ) . Cash grabs are usually some shitty movie added onto a franchise to take advantage of fans of the previous movies .

1 She kills you , yeah , yeah , yeah !

1 lol , amen

1 Bare skin , lots of bare skin .

1 Exactly . As a film it 's ... well , it 's rather unremarkable . It 's nothing we have n't seen before . So as a piece of film-making , it does n't hold a candle to other summer films like Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes ( which is actually a meticulously crafted film and carefully and deliberately told story ) . But it might just be the most fun you can have in the cinema this summer .

1 It also has aliens having their faces melted and Death Blossom .

1 I think you forget just how much of a market Marvel has with selling kids toys . Believe me , kids know the logo , which is part of why its absence is surprising .

1 But he 's the nicest guy in Hollywood : (

1 Please let this movie live up to the last one !

1 Having seen it recently , it 's much , much better than the industry feeding-frenzy of the era would have you believe . Even Siskel and Ebert went at the film with a confirmation bias , criticizing details with a magnifying glass . In essence a $ 44 million art film ( $ 130 million in today 's dollars ) , why Hollywood would hysterically sabotage their own enormous investment , I 'll never understand .

1 You 're a banana .

1 Did they seem to forget that Argo was based off a true story and that Affleck 's character would most likely want to see his wife and kids after he completes the mission ?

1 That Pedro Pascal is so hot right now ...

1 He did n't . He produced it and helped write it .

1 Do you like hurting other people ?

1 It 's the `` wow '' factor , you just do n't notice it . The same way effects looked incredible in LOTR and now some of them looks obviously fake , you view it differently once you 've seen better .

1 He 's remembered for wanting to blow up parliament , which is something we can all get behind

1 Werewolves not swear-wolves

1 Yeah but with hardly anything written about it by Tolkein , it 's unlikely to ever be put to screen , he did have some pretty important and interesting adventures as a young man .

1 It 's only had 8 reviews , and all of those reviews agreed that it was better than average i.e. all scored the movie greater than 5 / 10 . Rotten Tomatoes simply reports the percentage of reviews that were positive . In this case all 8 reviews were positive so it received a 100 % score .

1 The guy playing the German guy is an American named Steve Alpert , who used to be in charge of Studio Ghibli 's international operations ( he was with Disney before that and was instrumental in getting Disney to distribute Ghibli films in America and elsewhere ) . He and Miyazaki were / are very close and he asked him personally to take on the role . Funny thing about his voice acting , Miyazaki asked him to speak worse Japanese ... and his singing they wasted a whole day taping because it was so bad and off key . The next day more of the same and they are running off schedule , so Miyazaki buys a bottle of wine and gets Alpert drinking and they get the one usable take .

1 A spider and dust .

1 I watched the trailer and read the wikipedia entry . That sounds 1000x more disturbing than any work of fiction I have so far seen listed . There 's no way in hell I can possibly watch that .

1 He peed on the Dude 's rug .

1 No ... he just lost his wife and daughter and is all alone . Much happier of an ending .

1 he 's amazing live

1 I do n't care what other people do with their money or their time . So I 'm very indifferent about it .

1 I mostly came to check out Tia . Am disappoint .

1 Binoculars are pretty cheap these days .

1 It 's even been to Iceland . Now that 's late .

1 Well that 's just silly .

1 He was also Richard the Lionheart in another Who serial . But yeah City of Death is the fucking tits .

1 I only clarified because I only saw the ultimate edition

1 The standard-looking three hole plug cracks me up .

1 Haters gon na hate . Nolan 's a modern movie master . Ha yuck !

1 Yeah well most people do n't get to do what they want , and when they do that they are n't making bank . They are just going paycheck to paycheck .

1 I had a picture for that one but the file was corrupt . But ya I actually watched that a few weeks ago

1 I can see that . Princess Bride uses a taste that only appeals to a certain amount of people .

1 Well F.A.O my Schwartz

1 I vote they go with Pierce Brosnan . He seems to be in the middle of a comeback right now .

1 It was definitely a cesspool , I assume you are correct .

1 Regular Digital IMAX is not a higher quality than a standard 4K movie , just a taller aspect ratio ( a lot of Digital IMAX films are still 2K , GOTG was filmed in 2.8K ) . For digital movies , 6K is about the highest resolution camera they use . 70mm film ( such as Tarintino 's upcoming * The Hateful Eight * ) is said to have a 12K digital equivalence and 70mm IMAX films ( such as Interstellar and the upcoming Star Wars ) are said to have a 14K-16K digital equivalence .

1 Fargo

1 What ? That 's hilarious ! Why would n't it be funnier ?

1 Agreed . That scene in the trailer sold me on him as Joker .

1 haters gon na hate

1 A fair and thoughtful response . Thanks for the reply .

1 Karma whores , bro . I guess eventually it becomes an addiction that can only be filled by seeing your karma points go up and up .

1 In regards to Aubrey Plaza , maybe not a member of the team but ... . `` Ghostbusters , whadda want ! ? ''

1 Which inspired one of my best tweets . `` Life in Norway is a bit like Chess ; Being white is an advantage , but becoming a winner as black is a bigger accomplishment . Also , the pawns are useless . ( Norwegians use the same word for pawns and farmers )

1 It sounds like they hired the mentor of a different person who also did a bad job .

1 I loved the premise of that movie but I wanted more weird stuff and creatures and way sooner in the movie .

1 The Drive song is `` A Real Hero '' by College ( feat . Electric Youth ) . This is the second time someone got it wrong in here , figure I 'd give a heads up .

1 No , he 's not in the novel ... neither are Galadriel and Saruman . Despite the fact that all three are in the movie for the exact same plot line and reason , I do n't see any complaints about their inclusion . They 're all part of the White Council , and they 're all in the movie as part of the issues with the Necromancer , none of which is expanded on with any detail within the pages of The Hobbit itself . It was long known that Jackson was drawing on the appendices to flesh out those details , and Radagast is a part of that .

1 This seems like a premise that could work very well as a parody of a children 's movie ; but making a straight-up children 's film about murder - even if it 's of a giant chipmunk - seems rather weird .

1 Same could be said with all categories of people ( Teenagers , Urban , Suburban and on and on )

1 Fiennes is awesome I wish they make M more like Harry Waters , would be interesting to see his conversation with Bond > Number One , why are n't you in when I fucking told you to be in ? Number Two , why does n't this hotel have phones with fucking voicemail and not have to leave messages with the fucking receptionist ? Number Three , you better fucking be in tomorrow night when I fucking call again or there 'll be fucking hell to pay . I 'm fucking telling you - Bond .

1 DAE not as good as Drive ? Yeah everyone gets it , people found it boring , others liked it . Stop your bitching .

1 Amen to that dude ! I got ta piss . Play 5 mins of trailers in the middle and ill be happy .

1 They were to busy trying to figure out the best ways to make the audience vomit from camera shake .

1 I think it would be worse to be told , `` It just was n't what we 've come to expect from an actor of your caliber . '' You could write off a comment about the movie being bad ; you did n't have a big enough budge , studio mogels got in the way , it was n't advertised properly , a hundred other excuses . It 's another to be told you just were n't as good a you as you usually are .

1 `` Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas . Five years later ? Six ? It seems like a lifetime , or at least a Main Era ? the kind of peak that never comes again . San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of . Maybe it meant something . Maybe not , in the long run ? but no explanation , no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world . Whatever it meant. ? History is hard to know , because of all the hired bullshit , but even without being sure of `` history '' it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash , for reasons that nobody really understands at the time ? and which never explain , in retrospect , what actually happened . My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights ? or very early mornings ? when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and , instead of going home , aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder 's jacket ? booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond , not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end ( always stalling at the toll-gate , too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change ) ... but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was : No doubt at all about that ? There was madness in any direction , at any hour . If not across the Bay , then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. ? You could strike sparks anywhere . There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right , that we were winning. ? And that , I think , was the handle ? that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil . Not in any mean or military sense ; we did n't need that . Our energy would simply prevail . There was no point in fighting ? on our side or theirs . We had all the momentum ; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. ? So now , less than five years later , you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West , and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark ? that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back . '' `` We are all wired into a survival trip now . No more of the speed that fueled the 60 's . That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary 's trip . He crashed around America selling `` consciousness expansion '' without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously ... All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit . But their loss and failure is ours too . What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create ... a generation of permanent cripples , failed seekers , who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture : the desperate assumption that somebody ... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel . '' first quote is from the book but very similarly portrayed in the movie . second is the scene you are referring to . I love these two monologues so much . They have all the hope and despair of the counterculture

1 If most women are like that ( which I doubt ) , then almost certainly you could generalize it to all of humanity .

1 Bruce was a hero . He lived the American dream . He came from poverty , worked without compromise and made something of himself . Maybe you should read about him ? Hard working family man who wore many hats . Actor , Director , Producer , Teacher , Philosopher , Father , Husband ... .I do n't believe it gets any more `` real-life Hero '' than that

1 I always thought that too but after watching all the footage of Tom Cruise being adored and treated like a God by the followers of Scientology , I think he likes the attention and all the perks he gets . I mean they give him * everything * , and that propaganda video that was almost 40 minutes long that praises him as the `` ambassador for Scientology '' is just completely insane .

1 * writer of Chronicle

1 Best answer here , IMO . Many actors steal the show , but commanding the screen is a good way to sum up Hoffman 's more dramatic performances . Really unfortunate we wo n't see any more .

1 Try [ r / tipofmytongue ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/tipofmytongue ) helped me find an 80 's show

1 Well he should know . He did drink 3 or 4 bottles before filming .

1 Take a lap .

1 [ Brazil . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=EvBF3Lxla98 ) Science fiction , absurd , surreal , dark , the whole shabang .

1 Not sure if serious , but : we see him do this in * BB * , travelling Asia and Africa / The Caribbean as an itinerant vagabond without passport or ID or money , stealing to survive . He can sneak , he can 'disappear ' , so one assumes he stowed away on a plane to get home .

1 Yeah , none of that rings true to me . Who thinks that Danny Trejo is a bigger draw than Jason Statham or Jet Li or Randy Couture or Mickey Rourke ( not to mention Stallone and Schwarzenegger ) ? They hardly * needed * a hispanic to round out this cast to get funding . I think this is something Danny tells himself to assuage a hurt ego .

1 That was Bully the Larry Clark movie . They 're talking about Bully the documentary from a couple years ago about bullies in school .

1 For some reason , I think he always tried to help Shawn with his career .

1 If anyone was wondering who Gary Oldman was in Hannibal it 's [ this gorgeous fellow . ] ( http : / severed-cinema.com / images / efgh / hannibal / hannibal-02.jpg )

1 I pointed it out since I think it 's the most recent of them all .

1 Almost . It a bold move cotton , let 's see how it plays out for them

1 HE WAS THEIR FRIEND !

1 That sites design is so bad I think it gave me cancer .

1 i see . not sure why anyone would care .

1 He 's had a couple tv shows that have been quickly canceled . The latest one was last year 's * Breaking In * which was actually pretty good . it also had the guy from * Reaper * .

1 The cast of its always sunny in Philadelphia

1 You ca n't forget about Rocky IV . It is a 91 minute movie that has 29 minutes of montage scenes . http : / stevemccutchen.wordpress.com / 2009 / 08 / 02 / montage-overload-the-insanity-of-rocky-iv /

1 I do n't have the tall guy problem anymore now that there 's a new cinema with huge seats + a lot of gap .

1 You know . There 's a moment in the third movie that suggests Biff is just Biff in every timeline and the only changes between the timelines is what people let him get away with . It 's when Marty gets back and runs up to his truck and Biff does n't know it 's Marty . He yells at Marty in the stereotypical Biff way we see in high school and the dark 1985 , deep voice , very angry and the second he sees it 's Marty ... the nice , happy , pushover Biff switches back on . Just another little interesting bit in an interesting trilogy of movies .

1 Yes , very pretty use of colors but very underwhelming narrative , pacing , and ending .

1 Yeah . I recalled that from the trailer as well .

1 I 'm really glad it brought up the Star Wars prequels because I just have n't heard it enough on here .

1 Rush blew me away completely

1 Jonathan Ross

1 I 'd say it 's mentally draining more than anything .

1 Rated R for Nontypical Profanity and Misuse of a Dessert

1 This is a heavily debated number in the pervert community . There is a large subset of people who do n't think merkins count .

1 Are you kidding me ? This the freaking Justice League . Everyone and their mother knows who they are . Every American kid born before 1993 watched the JL cartoon growing up .

1 Never heard this one before . Or a million times

1 Yeah , he was AMAZING in The Artist !

1 Well the people I talk to generally underrate it and do n't apprecriate it so much .

1 They would have had to feature the whole movie practically

1 I do n't think this is an example of a movie not flowing well . The launch countdown audio over the visual of Cooper driving away from his family was perfect -- him leaving is the climax of the film 's first act , and the audience is thrust ( so to speak ) straight into the second act rather than belaboring the point .

1 I agree with you so much that I 'm going to run my hand down your face .

1 One of the most visually stunning movies I have seen and one that I own on DVD - very similar look to Dark City , which could also be included in this list ...

1 haha I know ... ... .my body is ready !

1 I 'm with you on this one . I loved Batman Begins , and I think Cillian Murphy is great in it . I also agree with you on Maggie Gyllenglahsdnhall . The biggest plot hole in The Dark Knight is Aaron Eckhart and Christian Bale pining over a girl who looks like * that * .

1 I actually saw Chronicles before I saw Pitch Black , and I enjoyed both of them . I think Chronicles gets way more hate than it deserves . I have n't seen the new one yet , but I definitely want to .

1 Freeze , you diseased rhinoceros pizzle .

1 fyi , his name is takashi miike

1 ... And according to the actor , the character is wearing a mask crafted from the dried up face of his mother , like some sort of heavy metal , apocalyptic Cubone .

1 Open-Weight * Real * Boxing Celebrity Tournament : Will Smith VS Mark Wahlberg Stallone VS Daniel Day Lewis Mr. T VS Apollo Creed Dolph Lundgren VS Michelle Rodriguez * Who takes it ? ! ? ! ? ! ? *

1 I think all four Bourne movies are good IMO . I liked the fourth one . Edit : Matt Damon and Liam Neeson are amazing . I do n't care what they do , I 'm gon na see it . Like DiCaprio . Also , Jeremy Renner is pretty cool but not my favorite and he has huge fingernails haha . [ 7 ]

1 Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with a disease with a 2 year life expectancy in 1963 ! He 's doing pretty damn good ! ( Currently ALS median survival is 3-5 years from diagnosis )

1 I love how at the end of the movie they name all of the US casualties , mention the losses on the Somali side ( our enemies ) , but then completely ignore the two Pakistani 's and the Malaysian who died .

1 To add to this , * The Black Cauldron * is set in a fictional world based on Welsh mythology , and while the * Mabinogion * was probably written around the eleventh century , the stories contained within are likely much older than the 'Dark Ages ' ( I also despise this term ... it 's right up there with 'Celtic Fringe ' ) . It 's been a good while since I studied the * Mabinogion * in detail , but I believe the general consensus is that the tales are remnants of pre-Christian , pre-Roman Britain , but that the written narration includes medieval Christian elements in much the same way that the Anglo-Saxon text of * Beowulf * incorporates Christian and pagan elements .

1 1954 bra

1 > I wonder why he 's never won one . He 's been nominated 3 times Just because you get three nominations does n't mean you 're gon na get snubbed forever . Look at Jack Nicholson , it took his fifth nomination to finally win an Academy Award . Dustin Hoffman , Michael Caine , Sean Penn and Robert Duvall all won on their fourth nomination .

1 Six people left in the world and one of them is Bill fucking Murray .

1 Clever .

1 To answer that question though , when a film `` melts '' that is known as a brain wrap . It is a terrible pain in the ass to fix and frankly you 're lucky it only took 10 minutes ! What happens is the film gets tangled and sometimes falls completely off the platter , coming out of where it is being projected . This gives the appearance of `` melting '' or `` burning '' on screen . It can often take 2-3 people helping and 30 minutes to get it all in order and laced again . But yeah , I WISH we could deny people with children that late . I worked a movie theater at a mall , so we would get anyone from rich spoiled kids , to old people , or those individuals who found it okay to bring strollers to 10:30 showings ( I wo n't specify , but there was a pattern to what race these people would inevitably be : / )

1 This is the best thing I 've read all week .

1 New Jersey . I go to them constantly ! They are mostly AMC and are called Dine In Theaters . Check it out !

1 I do n't care . Totally is n't a vowel You know what , Fuck English . Its stupid .

1 * Especially Jackie Brown

1 There is no such thing as Marvel cannon anymore . There is now only Marvel-Sony and Marvel-Paramount , etc cannon .

1 Can confirm , have varicose veins in balls .

1 This is correct . Though moreso the advertising than the booze . Egos get stroked at the Oscars , not the `` Hollywood Film Awards . ''

1 I feel like its actually the opposite of what you 've described here .

1 I totally agree with you . And I think one of the best parts about Smith is that he knows how lucky he is . He 's very aware that he is in a unique position and always sounds thrilled about getting to work .

1 And a sequel to Star Wars .

1 He 's just high

1 This is it right here . I do n't think it 's humanly possible to deny the charm of one Steve Zahn in that movie . Or Guy 's hilarious dad . Or the scene where they first hear the song on the radio .

1 * Dickhead & The Buttfaces * , the most famed band of the galaxy .

1 Yeah , the article is pretty ridiculous . Marvel movies where never a display of great art and were most definately always cooperate driven movies . I think the best term to describe ( most ) Marvel movies is `` perfectly generic '' . They do what they do just good enough to be entertaining for everyone , but they actively refuse to be challenging in any way .

1 Not entirely sure , but I do n't think that 's how nukes work .

1 It was alright , but that was it - just alright . Fairly enjoyable couple of hours , though I thought the sound was * terrible * ( that may have just been the cinema I was in , however ) . The plot was n't that exciting , it rarely provoked emotions in me , and they made Zuckerburg into a caricature . He was like a pantomime villain . I also thought it was quite pretentious , and at times just ridiculous . I walked out of the cinema and thought 'yeah , it was alright ' . Worth the 6 quid I paid , but I 'm not rushing out to buy it on DVD when it comes out . I was completely taken back when it was nominated for so many Oscars , and even more so when so many backed it to win . I saw quite a lot of the other films nominated for the big prizes that year , and I thought the ones I saw were vastly superior .

1 nice post OP

1 He was able to fix the problems with Extremis , fixing any problems with bad reactions in people ( he stated that if he could do it while he was drunk , he should have no problem doing it sober ) . While they never stated that he injected himself with Extremis , its a strong likely-hood due to the removal the arc-reactor from his chest ( thats a big hole to fill ) . Also the implication that he is now `` Iron-Man '' and that Tony Stark will return . All signs point to him being injected with the stable version of Extremis .

1 Sad is what it is . This is just an example of people rising to the top without the skills needed . Even if you 're talented , you still have to build connections , so that top comment was n't wrong .

1 Well stop poxing oxen .

1 as with almost all Ridley Scott films , watch the director 's cut . it is a vast improvement

1 worldtimebuddy.com is your friend . But to answer your question ; 5am the 24th of July for Sydney . 3am the 24th for Perth .

1 You da real mvp , Gordon

1 Sometimes all I want is giant robots fighting giant aliens and destroying cities and other times I just want a good British comedy . These two picks are seriously what I would have picked too

1 > And that 's why it should piss you off . Despite what you may think , I can assure you no matter how shitty a movie turns out , it still takes A LOT of work by A LOT of people just to get made . I am no Tyler Perry fan , but I do respect what he has done for himself as a brand . He has a long , consistent body of work and I would never pay money to watch his Madea movies , but that does n't mean those who do are wrong . If his fanbase is displeased with the quality ( or lacking ) they are quite free to * not * see his movies . Nothing speaks volumes like dollars . Like Sandler fans , some people simply enjoy broad , mindless movies and have no problem catching one at theaters .

1 Wes Anderson films , especially Moonrise Kingdom / Grand Budapest

1 It had so many of the same themes as SPR . Unskilled in combat individual is recruited into a veteran unit where he learns the trials and tribulations of war , which include actions that directly contribute to the death of soldiers that he could have prevented which he eventually atones for , all the while his entire unit is killed defending waves upon waves of Germans during a suicide last stand until he is the last man standing saved by his own army !

1 Dude 's nutty , but the nutty ones also tend to have astonishing charisma .

1 No . She had a small , tight dress .

1 Insidious was basically only jump scares ...

1 And Hollywood does n't ?

1 While I do n't think the movie was the second coming like most of reddit does , the book was fucking bad . It 's such a loose adaptation though .

1 Ghostbusters is my favorite movie and I am excited at the possibility for a sequel . People might go `` Just let the franchise die '' blah blah blah but in the end it never will . I 'd rather see the original creators take a stab at another movie rather than Platinum Dunes or another `` remake studio '' a few years later reboot the entire thing to mediocre results . Sure Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis might not be writing it themselves but they will undoubtedly have creative inputs into the movie and what they want with the end product . What gives me the most hope that this will be a quality product is the fact that Bill Murray is basically doing `` quality control '' so we wo n't get a sub-par movie . With so many bad prequels , sequels and remakes that are coming down the line I think it 's time for the Ghostbusters to have their shot at the silver screen again .

1 That makes me really sad .

1 It was actually just before that . [ Dodgeball came out in summer 2004 . ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / DodgeBall : _A_True_Underdog_Story ) [ 'Chuck Norris Facts ' came to prominence in 2005 . ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Chuck_Norris_facts )

1 My absolute favorite movie , a legendary actor , and a wonderful character !

1 According to several of the stories I 've read about it , it is unsimulated . Example : http : / www.straitstimes.com / lifestyle / movies / story / everyone-loves-sex-why-hide-it-asks-love-director-gaspar-noe-cannes-20150521 > I have a hard time seeing how the MPAA will not rate it NC17 You 're right . The bigger question is : Why get it rated by the MPAA at all ? What 's the point ? It is n't necessary . If this film is distributed by a US company , they can distribute without getting it rated . If it * is * rated , it will certainly be rated NC17 ( with or without unsimulated sex representations ) ; and an NC17 rated film will sell almost the exact same amount as an `` unrated '' film . Arguably , the `` buzz '' from keeping a film unrated is as valuable as that NC17 rating . So just skip it .

1 As a cg artist I must say that although it 's really cool to make obvious and gorgeous cg shots like those in transformers or the hobbit , it 's also very satisfying when people do n't actually notice the amount of vfx present in movie or series , like those in the videos you mentioned . Thanks for posting them .

1 Mystery Team is on their rotating list , check up on it from time to time

1 Finally ! This one should be at the top .

1 Yeah I think the old Becky comes back and Roseanne is like where the hell have you been ? !

1 * GUISE , I THINK WE HAVE OUR SCREENWRITER ! *

1 Sure , if you 've never watched a bond film .

1 He 's right though , in that there are obvious quality reasons why the movie did n't do so well , that we do n't have to jump to Japanese xenophobia . Though , to be clear , I do n't think your thinking is off-base .

1 Because `` King Kong ai n't got shit on me ! ''

1 This is used well in House 's theme , though .

1 Seconded . It was a surprising treat .

1 I let out a very audible giddy school girl `` oooooh ! ! '' when I saw that one .

1 my god , you mean his opinion is wrong ?

1 Yes do it , it 's brilliant .

1 While I pretty much agree with everything you 're saying , I think QT walks that line between being inspired by older works and simply regurgitating retro references . Kill Bill is probably the best example of him Frankenstein-ing all of his influences together but I do n't necessarily think it 's a bad thing . It 's almost a separate art form in itself and I have to respect him for so faithfully recreating that which he loves all while putting his own stank on it . Zack Snyder is the flip side to Tarantino 's coin and Watchmen is the best example of this . He took Alan Moore / Dave Gibbons work and nearly flawlessly recreated it in a new medium but did n't really add any of his own touches . I still really enjoy both of their films but I feel Quentin is the only one with real personality . / rant * TL ; DR - Tarantino certainly blends a lot of tropes and influences , but at least he has personality to back it up . *

1 They might still be on French Netflix . At least that 's how I caught Him and Her .

1 For such well-known , awesome cast , the movie was a let down .

1 You know that Thanos can kind of be like that , right ? He 's not like Odin , or Eternity . Thanos is cocky and preening , and he says cheesy bullshit like [ this ] ( http : / imgur.com / DSszrew ) all the time . That scan is not bad writing that is `` supposed '' to be awesome and intimidating . Imagine someone speaking like this in real life , and that 's how Thanos actually is .

1 Agreed , Gyllenhaal did the perfect psycho , I 'd argue even better than Bale 's performance in American Psycho . My only real problem with it is the unpredictability turns predictable real fast , gee I wonder what he 's gunna do when Rick flips on him when he 's all calm

1 it 's all in the reflexes ...

1 [ Joker note . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ho8Nm1HyOAs # t=195 )

1 Yes please

1 The role of the `` sophisticated , intelligent British baddie '' in Last Action Hero was specifically written for Alan Rickman in an homage / self-parody of his role in Die Hard . He said he 'd only do it for a prohibitively large sum of money . So they hired Charles Dance instead , who wanted a t-shirt made saying `` I 'm Cheaper than Alan Rickman . ''

1 No it 's not . GATTACA-TGTAATC would be palindromic .

1 Wow , now I really hope that 's how Avengers 2 opens ; just the shield bouncing off things and rolling across the countryside during the time between TWS and A2 .

1 I have upvoted you , just so the One True God can kick you down further .

1 So fantastic , that I often forget his real name and only refer to him as `` Max Cherry '' ; )

1 Wayland did feebly scream `` NOOooooOOooo '' as David 's head was torn off .

1 It is from The Simpsons episode * Mr.Plow *

1 Orgazmo

1 He put an explosive in her phone..

1 I found it just badly made . I knew the purpose was n't to prove any of the theories . It was edited in a way that was just so painfully boring and monotone .

1 The CGI use instead of practical effects was pretty egregious . I 'm pretty sure Biggles 's swollen eye was CGI instead of makeup

1 Holy Grail : http : / www.wordle.net / show / wrdl / 3204787 / Holy_Grail

1 That was Spaceballs 2

1 I found this incredibly useful , especially the Trailers section that details what trailers will be premiering along side each movie .

1 I think this is a great description of the movie . I really did n't see Rainn Wilson as a hero , or even as a good guy . Especially in the scene where he beats the shit out of a guy for cutting in line .

1 Green Lantern is a comic book super hero movie . If you 're going to include it , then you need to include the likes of Thor and The Avengers , the Man of Steel and Superman returns since all had scenes that took place off Earth . Might as well toss in the likes of Fantastic 4 : Rise of the Silver Surfer . You 're also missing Pitch Black from the list , that came out in 2000 . I would n't really include Green Lantern in with the likes of Pitch Black and Riddick though . Completely different genre .

1 Swan : Under Moon : Over ( who on reddit underestimates moon ? )

1 I 'd like to know this too !

1 My Boyfriend 's Back ( 1993 ) ?

1 Never mind Requiem for a Dream or any like that , when somebody mentions any utterly hopeless , soul-crushing movie , * this * is what I think of . I reckon the only reason it is n't higher is because it 's foreign language and only rarely have I seen them get as much exposure as other stuff that 's in English .

1 your home movies

1 This is n't the answer you probably want , but the moon landing footage ( `` one small step for a man ... '' etc ) is my nomination for the greatest 3 minutes of video ever , just because of what it represents .

1 [ The Shining recut as a heartwarming family comedy ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=6s40Q6ODSI8 )

1 I won a kindle at a Halloween party dressed up as Marty . I got as authentic as possible . Even got the same shirt from the same company , same year and model nikes , same pins on the jacket . The jacket was a knockoff on eBay , as the original was custom made for the movie . Did n't have the skateboard or backpack , but I do have the camcorder ! Got the red velcro wallet with black trim , faded family photo in it , the note to doc . Even the Save The Clock Tower flyer with Jennifer 's number on the back .

1 You ... you do n't like * Jaws * ?

1 And that was intense as hell .

1 Yeah , this thread is n't `` best revenge movie , '' and I 'd say Oldboy is intentionally the least satisfying .

1 I 'm very excited for this . I played trombone in the pit for a production of Les Mis .

1 I was foolin y'all ! Those was jokes !

1 [ A British problem ... ] ( http : / imgur.com / dtpmV )

1 Not really ... They just wanted to use movie titles in the lyrics to be clever . I fucking hate fall out boy .

1 ... I know .

1 When I first saw the trailer I actually thought it was a parody of Oscar-bait movies . I was waiting for the `` record scratch '' and reveal .

1 I never laugh as hard in the theater as I do when I go see Jackass flicks . Fucking hilarious .

1 I love that scene , Hammil and Clancy Brown are just excellent . But ( it 's a nitpick ) I hate how he 's drawn there . I much prefer how he 's drawn in JL : U or Batman Beyond : Return of the Joker , [ seen here ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Etst4t3ES8Y ) .

1 Why 's Pulp Fiction even on this list ? There was no argument , they both loved it . I came in here for an argument !

1 ... maybe

1 You 're trying too hard . Simply what the movie boils down to is a mix of stories where each has some slight influence on the next .

1 Straight guy here saying , `` yes . ''

1 He was great in True Grit .

1 Well , referencing downvotes in a patronizing way is n't going to help your cause any .

1 He has a name ... he even did an AMA this week . And he totally railed your gf in Austin .

1 Thank you ... That was driving me crazy

1 Unfortunately not . Due to inflation , each individual dollar loses purchasing power over time . For example , once upon a time you could buy a coke for a nickle . Now it usually costs at least a dollar . At that time , a dollar could purchase far more than it can today . When comparing amounts of money between years , it is necessary to adjust for inflation in order for the comparison to be meaningful .

1 [ Cuddle.. ? What a fag ... ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=RP3jA9UEwkE )

1 JESUS H. CHRIST , THINK OF THE CHILDREN !

1 No he was eaten . They crashed in central park , and when they awoke , the monster was nearby . I found the scene believable . The monster swats this thing out of the sky , follows it as it goes down , and sees tiny people running out of it . He was in an open field , so it 's not like they were hard to see .

1 I guess I do n't really know any way to really * overlook * anything like that . My usual method is to stick to older films that focus less on the effects and more on the writing and story-telling . Really makes you appreciate how things were done back then .

1 You do know if it 's not Star Wars related , he is going to use The Joker voice ? He did both in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - Star Wars reference with The Joker voice .

1 I also felt that Faster also added to his range

1 Would be hell on continuity though ...

1 Um , I see what you 're going for here , but no . There is nothing `` credible '' in Prometheus . Every character motivation and trace of emotion rang dead , hollow , and false . Every character in Prometheus was an idiot and having them act like idiots hurt the film .

1 ehhhh , the are and are n't . They halted production 3 years ago , so it 's `` in production '' , as in they have part of it done and could finish it maybe one day .

1 Did n't even see that , holy hell .

1 A2Y-1MA0 The newest model of the assassin droids .

1 That movie left a bad taste in my mouth .

1 Neither would the prequels .

1 And the first Terminator movie ...

1 > You 're imaginary !

1 I loved it . It 's so ridiculously ridiculous that you have that much more fun with it .

1 Films that the Academy would find best of the year .

1 I 'll agree that it 's on par with the second and third movies , but the first is , obviously arguably , the best TMNT movie that 's been made . It manages to remain faithful to the characters ( by merging the comics and the animated series ) , which keeps fans happy . Also , the only other TMNT film to follow after that even seemed to address the turtles ' family relationships was the CGI movie ; the 1990 movie really made you care about these characters , and the themes of family and honor flowed throughout . The designs of the turtles are also leagues better than the hulk turtles we saw in the 2014 film . However , if you 're already convinced that the 2014 movie is superior , I 'm not going to try to sway your opinion . That 's why its your opinion .

1 It 's for a raptor cage , not a Nicholas Cage .

1 I thought that too , but then I realized that Rhode Island is a state .

1 [ Are you sure she is n't nuts ? ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=IWW8onRK_GA )

1 Not true . I know for a fact that the trailer music is new and was recorded in LA by the same orchestra Williams will be using for the full score . In my opinion they absolutely rocked the opening theme .

1 > which D3D is a partial remake of No .

1 Klaus Daimler , 40 , engineer . Calm , collected , German .

1 He has a really creepy organization that does stuff planting rice over seas allegedly but the video he made for it does n't mention rice but does mention `` self-actuation '' . That combined with the anti-vac stuff has turned me off from Jim Carey .

1 That 's just like , your opinion man In all seriousness though , I very much enjoyed the movie ! And I also understand the many references that come from it as well haha

1 I love science-fiction , Channing Tatum , Mila Kunis , and the Wachowksi siblings . The movie is terrible . It 's still worth watching simply because : a ) it 's science fiction b ) it 's visually stunning So , it 's better than doing nothing , but it 's not something you 'll watch twice unless your internet gets shut off and you need to put in the DVD to jerk off to Mila Kunis .

1 As long as Tim Burton does n't come close I 'm down for this

1 Can I see your demo reel ?

1 Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love and Reign Over Me . I really wish he would take a few more serious roles , he has talent .

1 underdeveloped and uninteresting characters doing a series of unpleasant things that do n't ever quite gel into a narrative .

1 One of the few times I can say the original Charlton Heston version was actually better .

1 Just rewatched Arsenic and Old Lace last night . Can confirm it is impossible to be sad while watching it .

1 The last `` good '' film I saw him in was Shutter Island , and I thought he killed it in that movie in a good way . I was shocked to see him in the Dictator . Funny movie , but ... come on .

1 Evidently , this trailer gave away so much of the movie that Paramount considered it a copyright violation .

1 `` I hope that movies that I do n't like and have no obligation to watch but many , many others enjoy do n't exist in the future simply because I do n't like them and things that I do n't like should never be made . ''

1 Man , Gary Oldman was * so * freakin ' robbed that year !

1 Good calcium to you

1 This , if it werent for people buying comicbook movie tickets hollywood would have no chioice but to put out nothing but timeless , thought provokingly original films that find a way to appeal to everyone on a personal level and change how they view the world ! Thanks a lot sheeple , you are ruining the entertainment industry by being entertained by it !

1 If you had a cake recipe and left out the sugar and then did n't put any icing on it , you might have a loaf of bread . J Edgar is being sold as cake . It is bread . Dry bread . And there is no butter for that movie .

1 P.T . Anderson can do no wrong

1 I have never thought about this before , but regardless of the Empire reveal being ingrained in popular culture , your idea about keeping Anakin 's fate ambiguous would have been an awesome way to keep the trilogies connected . In fact , when you put it that way , the appearance of Vader at the end if III seems even clunkier .

1 The beauty of Jim is that we get to know a lot about his character throughout the film , but pretty much nothing of his backstory . He had parents ; he was a courier ; he got knocked of his bike . That 's it - he could have any kind of background , so `` normal guy goes Terminator '' is a criticism that does n't really hold much weight . Edit : I like the bad news theory . Before he saw the plane he was fighting merely for survival , and survival was a pretty hollow prospect in the world as it had become , especially after he 'd been burned by his trust of the soldiers . Upon seeing the plane , though , he had a glimpse of an outside world , and of an escape . This escape is what he fights for , on behalf of himself , Selena , and Hannah .

1 Start with the [ AFI top 100 ] ( http : / www.afi.com / 100years / movies10.aspx )

1 This is n't a reboot though . It takes place between 2 and 3 . The series took a pretty severe hit with Thunderdome . I do n't see why this franchise is any different to the likes of Star Wars or Jurassic Park .

1 It 's funny because that movie has no point .

1 Which is really odd considering how scenic it is . Oh well , at least the lack of Florida stuff is good for me mainly since I am tying to peddle some short horror / supernatural stories that take place in the area off to publishers and magazines .

1 Wow he looks really black in this one .

1 Koyaanisqatsi definitely . Goosebumps , man .

1 I do n't think he 's saying it does n't fit thematically , I think he 's saying it was a big leap from `` how are these magicians so good ? '' to `` oh it 's magic cloning '' .

1 I would n't exactly call iron man 3 up to par with the other marvel films either

1 Best line of the whole movie . He just gives up making up names .

1 If you want to pretend being commercially viable is n't a valid definition of success , you go right ahead .

1 Uhg , i hate that movie .

1 No , Barb dammit , Barb

1 I can imagine now a little bubble box over Vader saying `` * Hating sand . *

1 Truly awful list . Pootie Tang ? Napoleon Dynamite ? Are you really saying Rocket Science was funnier than Shaun of the Dead ? Half of those are n't even comedies . This reads more like a `` 10 movies I saw recently and want to say snarky things about . '' Where 's Borat , Hot Fuzz , Kiss Kiss Bang Bang , Anchorman , Best in Show ? I mean , Jesus , where 's O Brother Where Art Thou ? And those are just the ones off the top of my head . I 've seen at least 3 movies this year that are more worthy than most of the stuff on that list . And the Worst list is so lazy it is n't even worth commenting on . Buried .

1 I 'm just glad they did n't try and base it off the Illiad .

1 Pretty much any movie scored by Cliff Martinez , he did well-known movies like * Drive * and * Spring Breakers * , but the soundtrack for Soderbergh 's * Solaris * and * The Underneath * are also exquisite .

1 [ Batman Returns ] ( http : / 2.bp.blogspot.com / _knkvaxcxu7Q / TL9iy5Q90SI / AAAAAAAAAsI / ooyxXi7bPWM / s1600 / batman+returns.jpg )

1 Hold the fuck up ... . Tremors was not crappy !

1 [ coughs whilst saying ] Bullshit .

1 That was the joke . : /

1 Does n't everyone act surprised that he 's there , that `` Marty '' is supposed to be off in Switzerland skiing or something ? I swear there 's a line of dialogue that covers it .

1 While we 're on the subject , Aladdin is very apparently a ripoff ( or maybe homage ) of the Thief and the Cobbler , a film that was being painstakingly produced by Richard Williams ( animator of the Pink Panther and Roger Rabbit ) over the course of decades , mostly as a one-man passion project . It was unreleased when Aladdin began production but it was already legendary among animators for its amazing mindblowingly ambitious and intricate hand animation . The Thief and the Cobbler was eventually taken away from Williams and completed by Miramax but only after the studio chopped it to pieces , added obnoxious songs and unnecessary dialogue , and generally ravaged its artistic integrity . Ironically when Cobbler was finally released after being in production for decades and inspiring multiple generations of animators , it was dismissed by critics and audiences as a lame Aladdin ripoff , even though it had inspired Aladdin to be made in the first place ! It 's too bad because Williams did some truly spectacular work on it and the complex animated sequences are almost OCD in how painstakingly and lovingly they have been animated , mostly by Williams . Unfortunately most people will never see the fruits of all that hard work .

1 The last person I think when someone says Batman is Val Kilmer , [ poor guy ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=-rF_MDb03dA )

1 I 'm pretty sure I 've seen a porno with that title . Edit : Bed speling

1 Do yourself a favor and watch Band of Brothers .

1 > 16 bit

1 Yeah , they are getting closer , but they still have n't crossed the uncanny valley . Anyone with regular eyesight could look at young Bridges in that movie and tell that something was ... off .

1 Motherfucker do n't you ever , ever , * ever * shit talk Cap ever again . Seriously though , do n't bother putting negative stuff about it on here ( read : anything that is n't positive ) because it 's the first trailer and people are going to go apeshit over it and people will downvote you for putting it up . Do n't take it to heart . There will be people that agree with you , and people that wo n't . But that 's reddit . Once all the hype has died down a little you 'll be able to get sensible discussions , but right now people are just not in a state of mind to accept any sort of criticism ( no matter how well thought out and warranted it is ) . I agree that this trailer did not really 'wow ' me . But I can see little flairs of good . So hopefully it 'll work out for the best . Anyway , I 'll ride down with you , you 're not alone .

1 `` See you at the party Richter . ''

1 novelty account fail .

1 Here 's an article that explains why http : / hollywoodandswine.com / adam-sandler-throws-back-carrying-friends-professionally-last-20-years /

1 The key is looking at his feet . He 'd twisting around and facing the completely wrong way in order to catch a photo-op .

1 Seconded .

1 So this video mentions the `` BWAAAAAA '' sound and credits Inception with it ( which most people do ) then immediately cuts to examples of other films that have ripped-off the sound . The first of which is District 9 ... which came out a year before Inception ?

1 Have you ever met a star wars fan ?

1 The virus that made the apes intelligent also kills humans so I 'm sure most of the population was knocked out because of it .

1 Being chewed on while taking a shit was much more memorable

1 I think terms like overrated and underrated are completely subjective . So a lot of people like this movie , you 're saying they 're wrong for liking it ?

1 Planes Trains is one of my favorite comedies , but this scene is always so powerful . John Candy is incredible in it . They have amazing chemistry . John Hughes is an utter genius .

1 Thanks man , good breakdown . I went with `` he has cool armor '' , but this is much better .

1 Read the title , it 's not Brandon . It 's Tintin .

1 Wow really ? I absolutely loved it , the whole thing was amazing . One of my favourite movies for sure .

1 TWS and AoU were both amazing in 3D , no gimmicks just enjoyable 3D . I 've hated every movie I watched in 3D prior .

1 That was the point of Khan , he 'd been exploited . Morally ambivalent .

1 I never said that Micheal Brown was not at least partly responsible for what happened or that police officers have to run away . I am not sure how you got that idea . I was just stating that the idea of a role reversal ( such as whites being lynched instead of blacks ) just is n't there . If it was a role reversal it would be a dead white kid and a mostly black police / judicial authority finding a black officer innocent .

1 That 's because she realized she can be replaced with a computer : -p

1 Pretty good choice imo . Dude can act .

1 You do know that Akira is based on a post-apocalyptic Tokyo setting ? This would be like a Chinese counterpart making a movie about Gotham or Rome with all Chinese actors . It does n't make sense , and destroys the storyline .

1 Sony and Marvel are separate studios , that 's why ( Sony bought the rights to Spider-Man movies years before Marvel started their own movie studio in 2008 ) . Sony would n't be able to reap all the money from a Spider-Man / Avengers cross-over because Marvel Studios would be in a for a * huge * portion of the pot .

1 He was referring to John Carpenter 's 1982 * The Thing * , which is a remake of the 1951 movie * The Thing From Another World * .

1 [ Al Gore puts record on of `` Celebrate Good Times '' ] Al Gore : ( Calmly ) I will .

1 you realize this covers roughly 90 % of reddit posts ?

1 Well , that movie was a * shipwreck * ... I 'll show myself out ...

1 it is aimed at the same demographic as Night at the Museum . You could say the same thing about Stiller . But both movies are in fact kid 's movies .

1 yes

1 Snitches get glitches

1 The boy plays a damn good robot .

1 Flawed . Not as good as LotR but very entertaining . Definitely worth a watch

1 Are you seriously under the impression that one of the most seminal , popular and highest-regarded westerns of all time is underrated ?

1 this is seriously the reviews of a 12 year old boy

1 Here 's a world-class film on the subject that 's not Science Fiction : Wim Wender 's exquisitely romantic and existentially charged * Wings of Desire * : ( wherein angels roaming around Berlin , eavesdropping on the secret thoughts of humans , discuss the sorrow of not being physical and alive and ignorant enough to experience the glories of existence anew -- instead of tragically knowing everything ) : http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0093191 /

1 I think Scientology will be dead in 200 years but I guess we will see

1 he 's Heimdal in Thor

1 clever boy

1 Johnny Greenwood from Radiohead did the whole score . It 's all very intense strings the whole time which keeps you on edge . Great pick and awesome movie .

1 Boy , you 're really pushing that website . Let 's talk to a mod about it .

1 What , were those his actual last words or something ?

1 He would be good .

1 The fact that they are SO rich and famous , means they get recognized for their work all the time . Especially when giving awards to big budget movies , it 's just self-congratulatory . Not that other award shows are much better .

1 Too Big To Fail

1 Cool story , Hansel .

1 It was terrible . Even the extras were poorly motivated .

1 The downvotes indicate that he is not white .

1 Heaps of big budget films have used Canon DSLR 's for actions scenes . They are light weight , have great image quality for the 2-3 seconds that actually appears on screen . The video from a Canon DSLR can really be colour corrected and processed in such a way now that I doubt anyone would ever tell the footage they were looking at was from a DSLR . They have been doing this for quite a few years now .

1 The same way took Tom Cruise knew ; they could `` feel it '' .

1 I 'd be hard pressed to say it 's really about immigration . The backstory is more analogous to a refuge situation where a huge population suddenly surges into an area that 's not well-suited to handle it . There are obvious parallels to drawn between the two , but even though there is some overlap , I do n't think that the movie was intended to be about immigration at all . They director grew up in South Africa during the apartheid . It 's not hard to think that the movie and his life has been heavily influenced by that .

1 His name sounds like his scores .

1 In that time she managed to say she 's `` A bounty huntah '' at least forty hundred different times .

1 When they were discussing mutants & sentinels with Trask in the Oval Office Nixon orders one of his flunkies to turn off the tape recorder .

1 > M. Night Shymalalan Agreed . M. Night Shymalalan sucks .

1 How dare people like different things than you ? The nerve of some people ...

1 Sounds like we have our plot for Expendables 3 then now , huh ?

1 Me too . It made my imagination go wild for days .

1 I feel the same about Godzilla . Giant mutant Dinosaur roaming New York ? !

1 It 's good . Like really good .

1 I 'm actually extremely excited about the movie ; I am a bit of an objectivist , though not quite Randian . I 'm just amused by the prospect of millions of audience members having the same reaction to the film that I had to the book ; namely , sudden extreme fervor for objectivism , followed by a slow realization of just how much thought must go into any attempt to follow said philosophy .

1 Lil Wayne style rhymes do n't count .

1 It 's probably just for a single scene or something near the end . In [ the trailer ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=GAglZjX3HOk ) we only see him as young Nelson Mandela .

1 A lot more subtle though .

1 I can vouch for being fooled by that trailer . It seems that that franchise had very well put together trailers but the movies were complete ass .

1 I made this awhile ago ... more of a poster though . [ flickr link ] ( http : / www.flickr.com / photos / melberger / 6196086451 / )

1 Well , she does speak fluent French with a hint of English , so I guess she just reversed it .

1 Oh yeah , I was n't thinking that at first but that works too . I was thinking he was Buttman and now he 's Batman . A weak connection bound together by a homonym but it 's what I was thinking

1 Yeah , all the hype was really pointing the other way . That this was the end for him . But that was clearly false . The big relief for me was the Asgard focused scences . They actually had some pop and the contrast with London really brought that out . Very jealous you saw it on IMAX .

1 A week ? Naw it was in theaters for at least a couple months .

1 Nope , it 's just fun to try and guess who 's going to win .

1 Nope .

1 The plotline of Inception reminded me a lot of Ubik . Either way , it 's an excellent read .

1 Oh fuck , that was terrible . And Riddick 's come-ons were serious creeper material .

1 I never said it was a bad movie . But watching it always kills me . I remember telling my girlfriend about the movie and she started crying . Just from the description . A thousand dead Bambi mothers does n't come close to the sadness of Fireflies . I remember for the next two months after watching the film thinking about it and discreetly weeping in supermarkets .

1 one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history ...

1 Chiwetel was hardly a big name .

1 She 's just not a very good actress if you ask me .

1 Yes , so much . Amazing movie .

1 There 's a joke somewhere here involving your name..

1 haha yea i like the story and some of the bits in it . but damn is it so dated !

1 [ Aaron Copland 's beef song : ( ( ( ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=LsReWx9XdNs ) It was fucking fantastic before the beef ruined it `` Shit on a shingle , it 's what 's for dinner ! ''

1 I always loved [ Burt Bacharach & Elvis Costello doing Never Fall In Love Again ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=6sbNQoGwXGg ) in Spy Who Shagged Me . Just The Two of Us was also a highlight .

1 Whether the movie sucks or not is n't the problem , its the fact that no one should have any say in what we can watch . Its our first amendment and if this shit flies , it can get much worse . I believe you should be able to make fun of anything .

1 Nope but a million other people on Reddit could .

1 Thankfully the production company decided to part ways with him or we would 've missed some of the best casting of a role ever .

1 `` No brother , they expect to find one of us in the wreckage . '' That 's when I knew he was dedicated to the cause . Such a pragmatic , evil man .

1 I found new respect for Toad when I found out he is played by the same guy as Darth Maul .

1 Another one of my favorites ... .. That scene in the original Terminator where the janitor asks `` What have you got in the , a dead cat ? '' and out of a menu of likely human responses , the terminator selects `` Fuck you asshole ! '' Everyone in the theater just busted out laughing .

1 Nope , the magazine cover is all we need , plus the things we assume about it , it 'll suck before we even see the first traile , r end of store / s Seriously though , I 'm all for this . Have been seeing photos of some of the cars that might be used .

1 I really liked how they mixed Smaug 's voice with Thorin 's as he began to lose himself to the madness

1 No screen capture needed , you did a bloody good job at describing it ! Reminds me I got ta rewatch it .

1 I always thought if they did another one , it would be like this : Dr. Evil does something truly evil . Not comically evil , like something actually bad . Cut to Austin and `` Doug '' as Dr. Evil now goes by , having a blast at Austin 's pad . Basil Exposition shows up with several armed guards to arrest Doug . Doug convinces Austin , during a private visit from prison , that he has been framed , possibly cloned . Austin goes rogue from MI6 to prove his brother 's innocence . Mini-Me either comes along for the ride or is also locked up with Dr. Evil . Shenanigans ensue , including running into `` Fit Bastard , '' the original `` Fat Bastard '' who is now extremely fit but still a bastard . In the end it is revealed Scott disguised himself as Dr. Evil and committed the terrible acts from earlier . Austin saves the day , Scott gets away . Roll credits .

1 You have to realize the US has snubbed Canada a few times . After 9 / 11 Bush never thanked Canada ( for allowing thousands of Americans to stay in Canadian homes , arenas , schools after the planes were grounded ) he thanked 20 other countries who just mainly called and say they were sorry it happened . And in Apollo 13 it was university students in Toronto that got your astronauts home . Not that you 'd see or read about that in the movie . It riles up Canadians anytime we get snubbed .

1 Paul Thomas Anderson .

1 Thanks for the spoiler .

1 It sounds more like someone working on a first draft for their freshman creative writing class than a well thought out film review .

1 Talk about pretentious

1 Considering nobody has really seen it yet , that do n't mean much . Notice how [ there are exactly zero user reviews ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1545660 / reviews ) .

1 I dunno , I think A Space Odyssey is still fitting when you think about it .

1 affleck is a damn good scriptwriter , being a convincing batman on the other hand ... .

1 This is so weird but I just went on youtube and it just recommended I watch a movie trailer for My Lucky Stars 2 : Twinkle Twinkle Lucky Stars - It 's the movie ! The bots are getting way too clever for my liking ... : | Here is the trailer - https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=J3HkC3FjnRc

1 I remember , but I 'm curious if that previous success will translate to the box office .

1 The MPAA gets less and less relevant to the rest of society with each passing day . It 's actually kind of comical . If only they did n't have so much power within the industry ...

1 Why do you wish you were joking ? Pubic lice fetish ? Weirdo .

1 Oh god yes , it 's like ... but this is happy , SO WHY AM I CRYING ! ?

1 You should watch * Surfer , Dude *

1 you 're reading it backwards .

1 * 24 * , with Jack Bauer , has taught us all how much can be accomplished in 1 hour . No one is falling for your complaint here .

1 I can tell by your username that you 're a fan haha . And while normally I 'd agree that Tobey is n't a good actor , I think it worked for the movie . His character is supposed to be this awkward person trying to fit into a place he just does n't belong . He gets swallowed up in all the greed and terrible people so quickly that he forgets who he is and where he came from . I think Tobey 's mediocre acting worked to his advantage .

1 The man was in so many great movies but if there was ever a reason to shy away from the spotlight , your wife dying and focusing on raising your kids is pretty good one . His music is n't half bad either .

1 This . ^^^Notion ^^^just ^^^crossed ^^^my ^^^mind

1 We 've known about the possibility of internal refraction of light since the 1840 's . The production of glass clad optical wire for transmission of light was done in 1954 . The TV cameras NASA sent to the moon were fiberoptic . The technology was certainly new in 1977 , which is why it looked so damn good .

1 Except if murder is so complicated that you need to invent time travel and send people back in time to kill them , it 's probably a good idea not to carry guns and pull them on people . Just bring a tazer .

1 The comatose skee ball enthusiast ?

1 Wait a minute ... . NILBOG ... . . . . it 's GOBLIN spelled backwards ! ! ! ! !

1 JJ Abrams hates Green screens . He 's huge on building sets and shooting on location . You can look at some of the amazing location work they did in the Star Trek films . They built a * huge * Enterprise set , and tried to find locations for all the alien planets . Even looking at what he managed to do on a TV budget with a Scifi show like * Fringe * is super encouraging . There 's going to be CGI , but JJ is a guy who has consistently spoken about his dedication to location shooting and practical effects throughout his career ( in [ this ] ( http : / io9.com / 349165 / jj-abrams-says-trek-will-avoid-greenscreen-fakeness ) interview he states his opinions on green screens at the end ) .

1 This is exactly why I dislike when people complain about theater re-releases . Sorry we are n't old enough to appreciate some amazing classics the first time around . Some of my favorite movies came out before I was even born , damn straight I 'd pay for the theater experience .

1 It 's that whole `` do n't think of elephants '' thing . Talking about something only draws attention . You 're right . The only way to really end this sort of thing is to ignore it . Any press is good press .

1 No problem .

1 Have you been to / tv / ? There are daily threads on Breaking Bad / Game of Thrones , waifus , Nolan vs . Whedon , and very little actual film discussion . It 's really not that pretentious , I doubt most of the users have seen anything past level 2 .

1 The Road Warrior has a nice one too http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=4GdhcgKycMk

1 His real name is Mar-Vell , his `` superhero name '' is Captain Marvel . Of course , Mar-Vell is dead now , and Carol Danvers has taken up the Captain Marvel mantle ( after being Ms . Marvel for ages ) .

1 No , I 've never met you , so I would n't do that . I 'm ok with people having different opinions than I have . ; )

1 Yep , I too saw it as a high-five .

1 nah stainless steel surgery . Helps with the corrosion resistance .

1 Get me ... THE COMFY CHAIR !

1 `` Oh , are they ? ''

1 That 's kind of like asking whether a movie shot in black and white will ever win Best Cinematography again . The answer is obviously `` maybe , '' but it 's made unlikely just by sheer numbers . We do n't shoot very many films in black and white any more , just as we do n't make many visual-effects-heavy movies without computers any more .

1 I thought it was actually pretty funny .

1 laughed my ass off as did most of the american audience in the Louisiana theater . laughs was without a doubt one of the reasons they put that scene in there

1 I like to see it as everyone has a story they 'd like to tell . Anybody can try to direct if they have the storytelling sense . Does n't matter if you 're a cinematographer ( Nicholas Roeg did it amazingly ) or an actor ( Clint Eastwood , Charles Chaplin , etc. ) . But sometimes , you 're just not good . Like Gosling .

1 And * The Pianist '' is French , unless there has been some major change in Roman Polanski 's legal status in the US .

1 Woman here . We like different things . Crazy , I know . For me personally , it 's alright . Maybe not my top choice , but better than super short / boring hair .

1 Yeah , when I realized the burned out druggie sidekick did large portions of the soundtrack my mind was blown .

1 Might as well ask for Scorcese along with him .

1 wait ... danny elfman is * dead * ? ? ? 1 minutes later : just looked it up no he isnt

1 What I say probably wo n't mean anything to you , but I feel obligated to say that Casablanca truly is as good as they say . It 's a small , tight story about two people who used to love each other but do n't know if they do anymore . It 's wonderful .

1 It was given up along with the memories of childhood .

1 How fucking stupid can someone be ? There 's nothing in that link that proves your point at all . In fact the data they do provide implies the exact opposite of what you 're trying to say .

1 I hate it when a trailer tells me the whole story . I love it when it gives me a taste and leaves me hongry for the whole meal . This would be the latter . I 'm excited to see it .

1 i just finished watching it right now haha , feel like watching more of the big man now

1 I was confused that there were n't 10 movies in each list at first .

1 OMG , have n't seen this movie since 1987 yet it was my first thought when I saw the subject . Yes , Excalibur , Braveheart , Kingdom of Heaven and maybe even Joan of Arc are better movies , but this one is rather special to me . Back then I was serving a year in the army and during that year I basically stopped going to movies . Went to see only three movies during that time - Living Daylights , Top Gun and Flesh & Blood . Then as we all came home friends asked me if I saw a good movie . They have all seen the Bond and Cruise but no one knew what the heck is Flesh & Blood . So four of us went to see it and later all of them blamed me for taking them to see this god-awful movie . Nevertheless , I liked it very much but I still a n't catch it on TV where I live . Oh , and another crazy medieval Rutger Hauer : Ladyhawke .

1 Hoggle was a big pussy and kind of a traitor tbh .

1 Or 1987 . The movie lost all relevance , because the comic already had a large influence on society 20 years before the movie .

1 no

1 it makes my head hurt .

1 More people enjoy them than do n't enjoy them . If you do n't want to see it , do n't see it .

1 Alternatively you can try mutual masturbation , play with a friend

1 it was definitely in several trailers .

1 Crossover with Aunt May movie .

1 > How many were successful ? Very few . The same could be said about comic book movies way back when .. I do n't get why everyone thinks just because there are n't examples of good video game adaptations that there * never will be * . Yeesh , keep in mind that when Paul W.S . Anderson is the most successful in the genre , it probably indicates that no one with talent has been given the opportunity to work on one . I frankly believe video game movies are going to be the next big thing as studios snap up properties for relative cheap ( as essentially every comic book has had it 's rights licensed out already ) . It 's going to be a gold rush once the first one hits big .

1 This is the major problem I have with the film . The Basterds are great fun to watch but they do n't really have much to do with the actual events of the film . Had they missed the premiere Shoshanna still would have blown the place sky high . I feel any time spent with the Basterds is wasted .

1 This has the markings of being one of the most gripping movies ever made , but I do n't think I 'll see it unless I get my yearly dose of dead babies .

1 Or when you 're 6 ... movie fucking scarred me though .

1 This one is my favourite . Craig was awesome , and that line followed by the music ... Such a great way to kick the franchise off again .

1 More time / energy / money sunk into purposely awful , pre-made cult stuff .

1 * I * will love this .

1 I think he confused Detroit with Troy , NY .

1 I agree , wag the dog is brilliant , I 'm just not sure if is a documentary or political satire .

1 I definitely think it 's underrated and I still think about the movie like was he an Alien inhabiting a body or was he just a crazy man ? Pretty awesome and when I first realized Kevin Spacey was amazing .

1 I 'll put some coffee on for you then , you 've an eternity of defending ahead of you ...

1 No one thinks that series is bad . The universal opinion is that the studios should have let Raimi do his thing because now we have Spider-Man 3 .

1 SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh..

1 I really loved it too , one of my favorite horrors . The lawnmower scene made me jump like hell even though its very obvious the whole time what 's about to happen .

1 `` Harold and Maude . '' I saw it the first time when I was 16 in the mid-70s , living in a conservative Midwestern town and feeling like a complete outsider with nothing in common with anyone - even my best friends . It made me realize there were others out there as weird and irreverent as me , and it just completely changed my attitude about the world beyond my immediate sphere and what I had assumed would be a boring and unfulfilled future . Suddenly , it was n't me that was weird . It was everyone else . I still love that movie to this day . Must have seen it a hundred times by now , honestly .

1 Back when the History Channel was about history they had a documentary about the Tasmanian Tiger and about people still trying to track them since there are occasional dubious sightings . It seems to have become more of a Bigfoot over the years since there is so little evidence of one still living .

1 Whoa whoa whoa ...

1 No problem . Glad to help

1 Agreed . Donner cut is exactly what sprung to my mind .

1 I second that ! I thought the avengers would be a hash together . But turned out to be a central excellent film

1 Yes , in general , but then he got specific about Armageddon trivia , and that the reason it had 8 writers was to hit first , but it did n't .

1 He should be dead . Not that I want him to be , but my god ...

1 I did n't . I put it together at the same time as Chazz Palminteri was putting it together looking at the corkboard of cuttings . Blew my fucking mind . I usually guess right early on and it was such a great experience to realize the reveal when I and the rest of the audience was supposed to . Great cinema experience .

1 yes its called SADs heart disorder you can get yourself checked out with ECG and Echocardiogram its rare but there are some links inherited biggest one..

1 Thank you . I 've played this game a thousand times and somehow missed that one .

1 See , I have to disagree ; I think Drive is a great example of neo-noir . The way they build tension through those scenes , the heavy use of action ( as opposed to dialog ) to advance the plot ... I fell in love with the film immediately .

1 It 's just not that big of a deal . I do n't even smoke . I 'm sure plenty of people are sick of gay people ramming their rights down people 's throats . It 's not exactly the same , but really , live and let live . Life will be way better , man .

1 The plot depended far too much on Mystique being * astoundingly * dumb .

1 Keanu with a cajun accent ? Whoa , mon frere .

1 You are another day closer to your death , David . Congratulations .

1 > I do n't see why this needs to be rebooted . Hollywood only looks at this part : > Its a bunch of dudes on a mountain with a helicopter , rope , and guns . John lithgow was the shit . The violence was awesome .

1 One of the best and most detailed bits of viral marketing I 've ever seen .

1 Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence .

1 Yeah , sure , go ahead with that opinion .

1 Die Hard . `` Now i have a machine gun Ho Ho Ho ''

1 Hardly an action film in the same vein is it ?

1 Alaska is part of the U.S . If an actor went to a particular country , all of the country is displayed .

1 What about movies like last years Winter 's Bone and True Grit ? Both movies were centered around strong young women ( and the actresses who portrayed each got nominated for acting at the Academy , as well as a best picture nomination nod to each ) .

1 Maybe he has and just didnt want it to become public knowledge because people would call it a PR move and it may come across as disingenuous . Maybe the apology really doesnt matter . Its public knowledge he went to prison . He already took responsibility for his mistakes . Decades later he has completely turned his life round . If anything I 'm kinda impressed by Marky Mark .

1 The Blair Witch Project-Same , a lot of people did

1 * Gif of spider covered in spiders above *

1 Watch it , you 'll laugh at some point .

1 > what is the point of going to another planet again ? To start over ? Do they have female passengers ? Reread it .

1 Or maybe it 's because Peter Dinklage is a good actor , just maybe ...

1 I was just about to say Heat . Dog Day Afternoon is a good one too .

1 > No it is n't . It is only scary if you are 12 or a girl . Seems like the problem is more you 're kind of a dick who does n't understand what the words 'subjective ' or 'opinion ' mean . Funny , really , since you then went on to say 'everyone has their own view of what is scary ' after insulting people for thinking something is scary .

1 If it were n't for the police charging the Blackgate prisoners , Batman would have lost . If it were n't for John Blake and Gordon , Batman would have lost . I think that the people did win the day in TDKR . Their only shortcoming is not having a plane readily availble to fly the nuke out to sea .

1 Seriously . `` It 's easy to forget that these stars were once as young as fifty years old . ''

1 WHAT ? ! ? That movie rules ! ! Goes from a killer comedy to a great action / rescue ! ! One of the ULTIMATE movies to watch late at night . `` Have either of you ever been convicted of a crime ? '' `` Convicted ? ... ..no , never convicted . ''

1 You sandbaggin ' son of a bitch .

1 false

1 Install adblock , then .

1 Spectacular . Believe * all * the hype . It is the best Marvel movie since Iron Man , and might just be * better * , with a solid narrative structure , compelling characters and lots of thrilling twists and turns - not to mention some incredible fight sequences . And as for adapting the source material : comic fans will find * a lot * to enjoy in this movie . The Winter Soldier storyline , though altered slightly from the comics , is very well-handled ; and the revelation of [ ] ( # s `` the HYDRA / S.H.I.E.L.D . connection '' ) was a delight for those who read the lesser-known [ Secret Warriors ] ( http : / www.amazon.com / Secret-Warriors-Vol-Agent-Nothing / dp / 0785138641 / ref=sr_1_6 ? ie=UTF8 & qid=1396634246 & sr=8-6 & keywords=Secret+Warriors ) storyline a few years back . Throw in a supporting cast of familiar names and faces , plus a few throw-away references to characters like [ ] ( # s `` Stephen Strange '' ) , and you have one of the most powerful adaptations of comics to cinema .

1 Betcha . And yes , it is definitely high in the pantheon .

1 Heisenborg

1 Its just a bear .

1 Do n't blame Hollywood , blame the viewers .

1 Its Eli Roth what do you expect . But it will be ridiculous and I 'm sure pretty damn creepy from the trailer

1 who ? [ gsp ? ] ( http : / media.ufc.tv / photo_galleries / ufc154_event / ufc154_12_gsp_vs_condit_006.jpg )

1 I like not deciding on which is actually true , it makes the whole movie bittersweet .

1 I love how he spends so much time analyzing this photo to get a `` hard copy '' of Zhora 's face . Even though , as we saw earlier at the police station , ALL OF THE REPLICANTS ' MUGSHOTS ARE ALREADY ON FILE .

1 Honestly , A Serbian Film did n't really bother me for this reason , it was just messed up for the sake of being messed up . I 'm more bothered watching the beginning of Saving Private Ryan , because it happened and there were people bleeding out holding their guts in their hands crying for their moms , whereas A Serbian Film is just absurd and ridiculous throughout for the most part .

1 `` The fog is getting thicker . '' `` AND LEON 'S GETTING LAAARRRRRRGERRRRR ''

1 As an ex-teenager myself that has never owned porn in his life , I could never relate to that plot point .

1 I enjoyed it . It might have been trying too hard , but I appreciated the effort , and I appreciated it more than most cookie-cutter films that get produced .

1 `` Cynical cash grab this is . Approve Yoda does not . From Yoda 's agent will you be hearing . ''

1 I thought about that , too , but the heart of the story is character development . They excel at that and , for me , the only other director that does it as well is Wes Anderson . If he had done it , though , I think it would 've lost gravitas . Either one would 've been better than Clooney 's , though .

1 Personally i prefer good story , characters and atmosphere to a presentation that is only compatible with `` huge screens '' and a high framerate .

1 The song towarsds the end of the trailer was so intense . I was excited as hell .

1 Open it in a browser . Baconreader smashes the image horribly . Chrome likes it .

1 I love dramatic Adam Sandler . Punch Drunk Love is one of my favorite movies

1 Do n't forget Jack Nance and Alicia Witt

1 Windigos and Big Foots

1 Say 'what ' again . Say 'what ' again , I dare you , I double dare you motherfucker , say what one more Goddamn time !

1 The acting was great , the cinematography was great , the story was great , the characters were memorable , I could go on . I really do n't see how it was n't worthy of Best Picture .

1 Casual racism makes everything better .

1 I think Empire is one of the only movies that I could watch again and again and never get bored of .

1 I disagree with both of you .

1 Mansfield resident here . This reason this prison is toured is n't because of some sick desire to learn of suffering , it is actually a beautiful building and one of the best movies of all time was filmed here . Also if people did n't I honestly believe Mansfield would make dissolve and leave behind a pile of heroine and meth .

1 No doubt they did too .

1 I have done it a lot too ! I had a rough time at home as a teenager and would slip into different theaters all day long , just to have somewhere else to be . It is probably considered trespassing , or maybe something like petit larceny but no one ever noticed or confronted me

1 The goon would make an awesome movie

1 6'1 '' ... shit .

1 Man that was badass !

1 fake

1 I got ta say , I agree . He stayed conciliatory for about four emails after I would have gotten completely defensive and called Mark Brazill a lying fuck .

1 Do not touch Willy . Good advice .

1 Nolans Batman is going to make back its budget in less than a week , guaranteed , probably a lot sooner , it will then proceed to make a shit ton of money and we will all be hearing about who will take over the cowl / directing chair within a month of release . We really do n't need to be concerned over new films being released . Arguing over which will make the biggest splash is the same as 2 football fans fighting over who 's team is best , people just like to feel included in someone else ' success .

1 Why ? What would that do for you ? I dont get why people do this . What do you want , a list of everything Jesse does until he dies ? The character arc is completed . He grew , he changed . You ca n't and should n't know everything that happens ever after in a story ; a story is just supposed to be a window into a little world . It 's best if it leaves you wanting more . If it does n't do that , that 's just shit writing . I 'm glad the writers of Breaking Bad knew and understood that even if their fans did n't .

1 Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor ?

1 > Nothing lost , nothing ruined ... Video quality because it 's compressed more .

1 Except for where [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` She stabs Batman and tries to let the bomb go off . Before that , I guess she is n't much of a villain ? '' )

1 Best ending ever , though .

1 I think it can be done as a 3 part film . Dune already consists of three separate parts , and they 'd all work as stand-alone movies with a little changes in pacing

1 Link ?

1 it seems it 's because it had the balls to kill off two fan favorite characters from aliens and got back to the simplicity that made alien so good . was it flawed ? sure . did it ruin the franchise ? hell no . personally it 's my second favorite after alien . downvote away , bitches !

1 The primary responsibility of the theater goer is to suspend his / her disbelief . ; - )

1 That was not my point , obviously a critic has to watch every crap thrown at him and sometimes , when he watches something good like The Hobbit he spews shaite . Anyways , what I meant to say was , people should know what they 're watching and put themselves on the context . When I was watching the last Harry Potter film , there was this dude saying : that 's not possible , or that 's not real . That 's stupid ! If you want real or not stupid , go watch something else . I will watch The Hobbit a lot of times because of middle earth , done .

1 Han shot first

1 That comment about the regular needs to be in bold

1 [ Ask an expert ! ] ( http : / timpfarr.files.wordpress.com / 2011 / 08 / jp-mr-dna.jpg )

1 And the greatest line from Star Wars ever ... `` Luminous beings are we ... not this crude matter . ''

1 Waltz had a better role , and acted it better . I did n't see anything in Leo 's performance that was special . He played a psychopath who shouted a lot . * Many * people have done that , and many have done it better .

1 Was the girl OK ?

1 That 's very good ... for a first try . I have a ball . Perhaps you 'd like to bounce it .

1 Yes ! ! Exactly ! I do n't want to see Smaug until the movie ... . Just have the screen go black and hear Smaug say one word or line would have been perfect ! Hollywood ...

1 Probably nuclear war with Pakistan / famine . India would be probably one of the hardest hit of any nation if the blight spread to them . There may be a billion less Indians by the time the movie starts

1 Ghostbusters the video game is pretty much Ghostbusters 3 .

1 He would prefer you did .

1 Woody Allen . I just do n't get him .

1 A little too cool looking for Peter .

1 Loved that movie !

1 I completely agree , I mean it 's kind of unfair to just say `` I hate this movie because the lead actress was n't pretty enough '' but honestly in this situation it 's completely valid criticism . I mean she 's like a major driving force in this movie and there 's the scene where he sees her across a crowded square and instantly becomes obsessed with her . For the plot to make sense she has to be like super pretty .

1 > The Shining and the woman in the shower . she 's the reason i have n't seen that movie in like 7 years

1 If you got the joke you 'd realize he was n't making a black or racist joke . It was a reference to that reporter mixing up people and was n't against any race at all . It 'd be the same if the reporter had mixed up two white men and then a commenter referenced that in the same manner .

1 Heart Throb was his 'nickname ' when he worked in the circus . Slightly ironic too ...

1 Now I kinda want to see a confrontation between him and detective harry callahan

1 Eminem and Perry have been consistently popular for years .

1 Regardless of your opinion of the war on drugs ( I likely agree with you ) the cartels are less than pleasant folk .

1 He really is the best part . It 's a shame there was n't all that much footage in Ep3 to work with . I know they would have loved to put him in there more . That said , Ep3 gave us the EXCELLENT General Grievous , so it 's all good .

1 With a trident , you guys !

1 I thought he was perfect before they cast Ledger ... Actually , with an older Batman and them supposedly using Miller 's universe as a backdrop he still might be a great choice .

1 The cinematography has been getting much better reviews than the rest of the film .

1 Moon ( 1994 ) now .

1 Boondock Saints is close IMDB : 7.9 META : 44

1 Under the right circumstances , I could see Lord and Miller being the perfect people to direct a Ghostbusters movie . Unfortunately , with Ramis dead , no good script , and Murray stubbornly refusing to be involved , the circumstances will never be right .

1 Booster Gold is great . Really cool origin story too . Edit : origin not Oregon .

1 http : / i.imgur.com / S25EO.gif

1 Too many chiefs Not enough Indians

1 Lol , logic-ed

1 His career , oh man his career . It would 've gone places .

1 It 's hipster if you have it more for pointing the poster out to other people , rather than how much you like the film . Hipsters usually like a lot of cool shit , but a lot of it is definitely image based . You 've already lost points for worrying about it but that 's not too bad . And if you do have the poster more for showing to your friends than enjoying the poster yourself , then go one up on all those hipsters ( because lets face it , what hipster does n't know about Metropolis ) and get a poster of the anime version instead . `` That 's a cool poster . What is it ? '' `` It 's a retelling of Metropolis where the german expressionism that was so apparent in the original has been replaced by a colorful landscape , where the dystopian themes clash against a vibrant and fantastical world '' `` Wow , so cool . So , so cool ''

1 I enjoyed it .

1 You obviously ca n't smell what he was cooking up with that scheme . It was brilliant .

1 I think it was funnier , but I thought Clerks one had higher quality of dialogue and craftsmanship .

1 : D So many wonderful moments . It really brightened up my day . If you like this you need to watch Road House . Of course , I 'm going to assume you 've already seen it and love it , based off your post .

1 Auto-tuned songs win Grammys .

1 Looks like a GTA poster

1 What did I get from the sequel , or what did I get from the original ? I have n't seen the sequel , when it gets 0 % on Rotten Tomatoes , I 'm not bothering haha .

1 Blade Runner is n't hyped like Dredd is . Blade runner is one of the most polarizing movies of all time due to the various versions .

1 Probably every English goth kid from 1987 to 1992

1 I 'm pretty sure Connery Bond raped all the women in the films . `` James , no '' James forces his tongue in her mouth . `` Oh , James . ''

1 `` ... If he was gon na decorate himself with my friend . '' - `` you be Will Munny from Missouri ; killed women and children . '' `` That 's right . I 've killed women and children . I 've killed just about everything that 's walkwd or crawled at some point ... and I 'm here to kill you , Little Bill . For what you did to Ned . ''

1 Dude I read this like 4 hours ago in my sleep deprived state , left to see the movie and was expecting all of this . Fuck you man , I do n't need this in my life right now .

1 No one mentioned the Nova force net either . On wide shots it looked like a fine mesh and close up the shimmering between spaceships looked like it was made of bubbles .

1 And comic books

1 I..I..I ... I 'm warm enough

1 Well they have their little formula they have to uphold . They had already used up that bracket and needed to throw the foreign scene some love too .

1 A significant part of that is that mass audiences and Hollywood are locked in an embrace where every character is either white and male , or , wherever their identity differs from `` standard '' , that portion of the identity plays into the plot . There are , of course , exceptions , but the dominant cinematographic idioms dictate that if you do n't want to spend precious film footage explaining why your hispanic female detective is a hispanic female , you just cast her as a white male instead . It 's the demographic equivalent of Chekhov 's Gun . And , of course , if the role does n't require that the character be male or female , you cast Sigourney Weaver .

1 So say we all . : (

1 There are 23 official Bond films , it 's easily in the Top 10 , possibly even the top 5 for many people .

1 Riddick had no use for a fierce hunting animal ... He 's top of the food chain . A partner that did n't talk back was nice . Do n't fool yourself though , the dog was just as much to have `` somebody to trip '' and get eaten first ... He did n't hesitate to use it to see how deadly the poison was .

1 He used to do some heroic drinking with friends like Oliver Reed , Burton and Harris , an epic party animal .

1 Well , really this is n't much different from terrorists . They believe so strongly in their convictions and that what they 're doing is right . Hell has n't there been serial killers that have claimed to be doing gods work or the work of a higher power ? I mean Jack the Ripper was killing prostitutes , though I do n't know if it was because it was easy or because he thought he was ridding the world of impure people . So , yes , I can definitely see something like this happening . Maybe not to the extremes of the movie , but I do n't think there 's a limit to what some people will do in the name of god or religion .

1 To be fair , he is right about the type being bad . I just wanted to hear his arguments .

1 > She does n't wear a belt in her everyday outfit , that 's her quiver . Sort of . It 's a part of the design of the dress and what is being invoked . > The colors of her new dress , and the one she hated are identical . Are you color-blind ? > She hated her fancy restrictive dress . Because it was restrictive . > I could care less how they make their employees dress at the parks . That 's not Merida , that 's a person . Who is wearing Merida 's clothes , but a fancier version . I 'm saying the redesign Merida = park Merida = every day dress Merida .

1 It 's a Tangled reference .

1 Everyone in the audience is watching on the screens . They 've done this in the past with animated characters .

1 Well multi-language remakes have been around for awhile . The 1931 * Dracula * was remade using the same sets and costumes in Spanish , and * Anna Christie * was first made in English in 1930 , then in German in 1931 because Greta Garbo spoke both languages fluently . The only other true example of a `` multi-language remake '' would be * Funny Games * -- the English remake , by the same director and using an essentially identical script , is almost identical to the original version , just in English and better production value . As for what 's happening with this , it 's nothing new . * Abre Los Ojos * was remade into * Vanilla Sky . * * Nikita * became * Point of No Return . * * Let The Right One In * became * Let Me In . * * REC * became * Quarantine . * Also , it 's important to realize how much a certain film is tied to its country of origin . * Nikita * was extremely French -- not just an action movie set in France , but a true product of French cinema in a way that it would be inaccessible , regardless of the strengths of its story and characters , to a larger international audience . If a story has wide enough appeal to justify making it twice , it will be done . Naturally , no film is made unless the producers expect a profit . It 's not some cheap grab at some extra box office receipts -- market research shows that a lot of people wo n't shell out $ 12 to read subtitles . And those people make up a huge portion of the filmgoing audience . I 'm not against remakes . The 1978 version of * Invasion of the Body Snatchers * was better than the original . John Huston 's * The Maltese Falcon * was leaps and bounds ahead of the adaptations that came before . There 's no reason for a great story to only be told ( or filmed ) once . And seeing as no film is perfect , there 's always a chance a remake will be better .

1 you 're really cool and edgy

1 I need to rewatch * Beerfest * .

1 NO , NO , NO ! What makes the original turtles such great characters is because they ARE the only ones to ever exist . It makes them special , unique 4 of a kind something that strengthens this in the second movie where they made Toka and Razar it ended up being a disaster , showing that when the Turtles were mutated it was almost as if it happened for a reason because it was almost perfect . Being only four mutant turtles made them band together and become stronger even though there personalities sometimes clashed . Having `` as many turtles as you want '' is NOT a good idea . You take away so much of the internal conflict with the characters .

1 Wolf of wall street was like half a porno .

1 I did say that somewhere else . Eastwood + war hero = oscar nom . And thanks for the downvote for having a conversation . Edit . And banking your movie on Ryan Philippe is not the best way to win an oscar . That 's my opinion . The oscars are as much political as any election you 'll ever vote in .

1 Stand by me ?

1 Ow . I cut myself on that edge .

1 I ca n't believe you just motivated me to try and watch Power Rangers , but kudos .

1 I saw a black family walk out of the movie about 45 minutes in or so , muttering about how inappropriate it was . I was in awe . What exactly do you expect from a QT movie about slavery lol ?

1 Do n't hate on School of Rock . Hate on my family , my friends and even my dog , Yogi . Just please keep School of Rock out of this ... .I beg you .

1 I would love to see Barracuda on the big screen .

1 Hold on , are n't they * already * rewriting the turtles as aliens ? As far as I can tell it 's got `` SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ABORTION '' written all over it already . Fuck it , cast Stoya and make the whole thing a porno . Might be the only way to save it .

1 If it 's in Staten Island , it 's probably not worth it

1 WITCH ! BURN THE WITCH !

1 Which means you really should have gotten the obvious joke .

1 Actually , it does . It goes on for like 20 pages of Dave going super light speed . passes some stars and a ship graveyard or some shit

1 Yes ! F * ck yeah right there !

1 I like this one the best . This is quite a well known controversy anyway .

1 Unbelievable movie . It 's a story that conveys so much - particularly about our response to adverse situations . Hardy plays a very interesting character with an exemplary stoic attitude . The suspense is definitely there too .

1 After Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind I 'm exhausted .

1 The trailer is a minute long relax

1 I used to live in that area . 45mph zone , that they lowered to a 35mph . There is a sharp turn ahead which is why they had to put the 15mph sign there .

1 I expected thats what it was , but could n't tell .

1 What is this , Epcot ?

1 They 're Brad Pitt movies , and kind of stand for the exact opposite type of movie Fight Club is . And it 's just the kind of details Fincher loves to toss into his movies .

1 that film upset me on a deep emotional level

1 Not Seu Jorge 's Starman ?

1 When it showed Erebor I felt so excited for the next 2 movies !

1 He 's a generous chap too , I 'm pretty sure he gives at least one Bond girl a pearl necklace at one point ...

1 No , it 's Genisys .

1 What ?

1 Ca n't agree more . Such an amazing movie . I just saw one Brendan Fraser flick he directed . I could n't even believe that he was the same director . It was just bad .

1 I hope not , because that 's not the classic 3 act structure . Classic : - Status quo - Interruption of the status quo , creating a problem that needs to be solved ( First Act is over now , into second act ) - Fixing the problem , going on the journey , whatever ( act 2 ) - Climax ( problem is fixed , 2nd act is over ) - Third act - resolution - where do we leave things ? This is usually the shortest act of the three . The shortest first act I can think of is The Proposition , which lasts only about 7 minutes . Longest I can think of is Sleepless in Seattle , which is about 53 minutes . Longest third act I can think of is Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King .

1 > This sub is like that film guy who whenever you ask who his favorite director is its always ~~Kurosawa~~ Zack Snyder .

1 The previous one did it for me , he looks like a demon , but his face is still recognizable , I wonder how , I mean , his face shape is completely distorted by the 'scaly ' demon skin and horns , yet I see him .

1 * If * he has a split personality , then one is retarded ( excuses to all mentally challenged ) and one is a chimpanzee with the keys to the banana plantation .

1 * `` I say , is Big Poppa going to have to asphyxiate a prostitute ? '' *

1 Whatever , Superman is the ultimate immigrant story . Of course he starts out as an outcast trying to find his way in the world . Two Jewish `` outcasts '' modelled him after Moses . He 's got to come into the scene as someone who 's treated with skepticism and earn the world 's trust . He 's got to find his place ... and there 's a stack of source material that says it can be done , and done well . : - )

1 Escape from LA happens around 2012 or 2013 .

1 I love Youth in Revolt . I love how all the kids act like adults and the adults like kids .

1 It 's amazing , prophetic , and completely ahead of it 's time .

1 Not a teenager , but nice try !

1 12 Angry Menions .

1 And at the end , she 's able to tell the social service people exactly why she 's acting strange toward her son , whereupon the threat of them immediately goes away .

1 Wow , I was n't even aware of `` Disney Fairies '' ( a book / straight-to-DVD franchise built around Tinkerbell.. ? I guess ? ) and its a bigger property than fucking * Spiderman * .

1 That 's a good point . Either way the guy was going to lose his body so you just as well make something good come from it .

1 Welcome to /r/MoviePosterPorn .

1 He 's just Tom Hanks with a mustache .

1 This thread is so hot right now .

1 It hangs above my desk . # 96 / 385 . Laurent Durieux is the man .

1 It was a joke .

1 nice try , dennis

1 I thought the choppy visual effect was annoying at first , then I experienced what you described . Damn I 'm still so high .

1 He succeeded in doing exactly what he aimed to do - make a film version of the comic . He probably should have focused on making an entertaining adaption instead . Even then , a lot of people were going to go to the theater expecting X-Men .

1 Argh ! But it SHOULD have had a twist . And they ruined it ! Damn you ! You 've riled me up again !

1 honestly I could n't have put together a more generic trailer if I 'd gone out of my way to do so . after the last two FFs I was already skeptical of them being able to pull this off , and it looks like they 're just playing paint-by-numbers at this point .

1 I 'm more worried that it 's a misguided movie with a good marketing campaign .

1 Go back to St . Louis , Magnus .

1 I appreciate your sharing this

1 Then the bottle scene changed everything .

1 Right , so at the end of the Iron Man 3 movie , Tony had each and every Iron Man suit he 's made fly in and beat up the bad guys . He ended up liking the idea so much , that he would later go on to make the Ultron program . Ultron is an imprint of Tony 's brain , minus human emotion . He 's meant to be a hive mind that controls the various suits so S.H.I.E.L.D and The Avengers can kick it back and watch Ultron keep the world safe for them . Turns out that when you take away Tony 's humanity , you get a cold , calculating engine of death . This is the story set up by the Cinematic Universe , anyway . In the comics , Ultron was created by Ant Man instead of Tony Stark .

1 Snap , I never thought about it that way .

1 To me its a great build up of the scale of the monsters , and not for their battle , but i understand yours and others frustration . Especially when watching the movie I was kinda relieved of the destruction , giving those deep breaths between their epic scenes was the best approach the movie could have done . It really avoided the chaos exhaustion other movies had , like Man Of Steel . Shame those gags inbetween were n't as special as the monsters were . * wording

1 > No more leboff `` comic relief characters '' . Fuckin ' yay I would n't count on it . Every Bay film has those characters .

1 I love when my bro Ewan McGregor sings . If they could do a cut of the movie with him just singing , I 'd be happy .

1 You could have saved the movie , jerk .

1 Why lower your rating ? It was an artists fictional representation of a loose idea ... not a factual documentary . Just my opinion when people get bitter about a film `` miss-telling '' a story .

1 No , you 're right . He was pretending .

1 No .

1 Do n't you remember the `` Mr Rogers is a WII sniper '' rumors ?

1 I kinda agree , but Im excited cause the first one was good . I just love these 3 together . Just like 22 jump st . Cant wait for that shit .

1 Relax , so a lot of people like the movie , just let it go .

1 He 's got range though ... ..he just does n't use it

1 OSCARS ... ..YEAH ! ! !

1 Throw away ? This is going to be so amazingly awful .

1 I love the movie , but I feel like the manic energy really tapers down near the end . ( Compare last fight scene with any of the previous ones ) . Still , definitely a movie I can turn to when I want a smile on my face .

1 I liked John Carter . Maybe it 's just my space fetish .

1 I think the reason it was so exaggerated is that drumming is really the only instrument where your physical exertion is visible to a viewer . It 's a lot tougher to show a complex sax solo than a fast-paced drum solo .

1 That 's fucking genius .

1 And not only that , but he 's a completely different Bond than the series ' previous actors . They 're not directly comparable .

1 I 'd love to see some Gotham Central-style action , too . Renee Montoya for the win !

1 So Jamie Foxx was the most intelligent one in the cast . Fuck I moved houses when there was a shooting in my neighborhood ... Your other pieces are normal star issues .

1 Use spoiler tags so we can still know why if we want without it being ruined for those that do n't .

1 So the entire plot of the movie is a `` light '' spoiler ?

1 In Bruges is one of my endlessly re-watchable movies . I love it .

1 He gets a bad rap because he does movies that he thinks would be fun to do .

1 Viewing them pictures on that website is awful , is there an imgur link ?

1 Do n't tell them what they can and ca n't do , you racist .

1 I believe they wanted it to be a goofier , sillier movie than Donner wanted , though I could be wrong .

1 I went in with pretty low expectations and was still severely disappointed .

1 I just wish he would play something a little more upbeat ...

1 The subway / train scene is still one of my all-time favorite action scenes . Damn .

1 Prometheus . An amazing trailer for a flawed movie .

1 Not blasphemous . It 's amazing . I 'm partial to the English dub , too , because that 's what I saw first . Those voices are those characters . Now on the other hand , I CAN NOT , and will not watch the English dub of Azumanga Daioh . Cringing thinking about it . Apparently , Osaka : Tokyo : : American South : American North . It does not mean give Osaka ( character ) an American southern drawl in the dub . ... if you 're familiar with that anime .

1 Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries .

1 Blasphemy

1 Gone Girl , man

1 For me , the female team does n't bother me really . What does is that they 're rebooting . With a concept like GB , it lends itself easily to a group of women starting up their own franchise in Branson / Scranton / Boise ( pick one ) while keeping continuity with the previous films . Any of the still living original GBs could cameo as mentors to this all girl team ( or not , just keep it in the same universe ) . But no ... they 're wiping the slate clean .

1 did you ever read comics as a kid ? it 's a chance to see them in live action as never seen before . also the special effects eye candy .

1 Shoo troll shoo

1 The first half of this movie was awesome possibly the best alien invasion movie ever . But once the dog escapes the fire by jumping in the room it turns to shit .

1 Yeah , but Coop also found it kind of ridiculous as he said it to himself . It 's kind of like Anne Hathaway 's `` love '' speech . She know 's it 's completely dumb and unscientific , she said so ... but they 're already dealing with unquantifiable ideas that have been way more ridiculous and unimaginable . I think all of the really clunky lines had absurdities that were was addressed by their execution . A lot of people did n't see any subtlety , but it was there .

1 I WISH I could have seen Pacific Rim in theaters . I was so pumped to do so , then it did n't get a release here . I was bummed . I really did enjoy Cloverfield , regardless of what anyone says . Hella better than Broderick 's Godzilla .

1 Did people honestly have high expectations for that one ?

1 Its true . You 're an idiot . Just kidding ! Watch the fucking show , damnit !

1 The look he gives the Youngling he was about to kill was terrifying .

1 That episode of JLU was phenomenal . `` You 're master plan was turn the human race into gorillas ? ''

1 Sam Rockwell is so underrated . Have you seen that movie about the giant satellite that orbits around Earth ?

1 I saw this recently . While it is not better than the original I found it an utterly fascinating and bizarre film . The ending scene is an absolute classic however .

1 There 's always going to be the occasional film that is really well done in 3d and is a piece of art in its own right . But they have to stop making every goddamn summer blockbuster , no matter how asinine , into a 3d extravaganza . Shit like The Smurfs will be shit no matter how many dimensions you see it in .

1 Wow , that was wonderful . What a great example of why attention to detail * matters * .

1 There were practical sets which was nice , but it was still amazing how much CG was used . * none * of the clone troopers , for instance , were real suits of armor . I get that some shots require CG , but some are just unnecessary and look * soooo fake . *

1 You watched an intergenerational tale about fathers and sons and forgiveness . The legacies of crime and justice . The value of family . I did n't love it like most did here . Blue Valentine was better but I appreciated its ambition and ideas .

1 You probably could n't do a better job because you ca n't properly spell or name the movies you are criticizing .

1 I do n't think a `` smart enough '' argument can be made , unless someone thinks they are the only ones that figured out the parallel storylines were related . For me , I was really affected by the relationship with the guy and the young girl . She had such innocence and natural curiosity , So really , `` if you did n't like it , it means you do n't have enough feels . ''

1 People should be familiar with the art he 's plagiarizing . His 'show ' was a combination of two Abramovic pieces : 'The Artist is Present ' and 'Rhythm O ' . The latter is easily one of the most important pieces of performance art ever created . Abramovic was assaulted , both sexually and physically , and was in very real danger of being seriously injured or killed . Shia sat in the backroom of a gallery with a bag on his head . There 's no comparison . And his history of disingenuousness and plagiarism just degrades Abramovic 's very real and groundbreaking work . http : / vimeo.com / 71952791 http : / www.museomagazine.com / MARINA-ABRAMOVIC http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=BwPTKmFcYAQ

1 I agree with your first point about Young Joe still being selfish until the very end . If you think about it , up until he kills himself , he 's still selfish enough to grow into someone willing to kill children to get what he wants . That part of him still exists , or else Old Joe would undergo the character changes that Young Joe went through , just as he picked up the memories as Young Joe went through them .

1 I ai n't trying to be . It just seems that this guy is trying to have his cake and eat it too to try and appease everyone . It 's all well and good to say that your work is satire one dark grittiness , but when that work contains nothing but grit and darkness , it 's hard to make the distinction between imitation and satire . There needs to be some levity included to let the audience know that they 're not to take it seriously , and that the film is not meant to be taken 100 % straight . Without it , there 's no way to tell if it actually is satire or not . The statement is convenient because it essentially makes the film immune from criticism , since any issues someone might have about the film can easily be attributed to it being satire

1 With Stan 's untimely passing six years ago , Shane , Lindsay , Alan and myself , all supervisors for Stan Winston Studio , formed Legacy Effects , a separate company . Stan Winston Studio is now Stan Winston School Of Character Arts , run by his son Matt Winston , and their focus is on education . They do a tremendous job of canonizing the craft and helping educate simultaneously . As far as finding FX work , the industry is always changing . Even in the six years Legacy has been in business , the landscape has changed dramatically and continually . It 's not tougher to find work , it 's just that the work keeps morphing and changing . To me , it seems that practical effects and digital effects are continually finding how to support each other . Both are necessary and both flesh out the creatives ' vision from different points of origin . In my opinion , Real Steel was one of the best examples of this that I 've seen .

1 It 's advertised and promoted as an alien invasion film . What are you expecting ?

1 So true , so true . I 've felt this way since True Romance .

1 I have to hand it to Meyers , he acted the fuck out of this movie .

1 Yeah , we got ta be careful when we talk about Cumming prematurely . Some people are touchy about that kind of thing .

1 Usually .

1 His name is what eventually did him in ; Lucas decided two Anakins would be too confusing and take away from his Shakespearian masterpieces that were the prequels , so he ordered the EU writers to kill . Anakin . Solo .

1 In the comics it was a small time crook named Joe chill that killed his parents . The bale / batman begins movie was a little bit closer to the comic book origin .

1 Story not interesting ? One lowly representative from Texas and a nobody CIA operative helped the Afghanis beat the USSR and unknowingly help aid the Taliban that would come back to haunt them . And its true .

1 AWESOME ! Love it

1 I do n't need no book learnin to understand complex social intrigue

1 What a blabbering and incomprehensible article . Complete dreck .

1 Man , even that 's pushing it . His visual style is so gaudy . His color palates are always all over the place . It causes the films he makes to never have a consistent personality . The way he utilizes a camera is so awful . He juggles between really bland and generic coverage and wide angles of which he thinks will give his film some sort of distinguishing characteristics , but he never stops to think whether or not these shots will fit into the visual continuity of the piece . He seems so insecure as a filmmaker . He is not technically gifted whatsoever , in my opinion .

1 Actually , ignoring differences in capitalization , you said `` Tranmorphers '' .

1 For French : Cyrano de Bergerac ( 1990 ) its the film adaptation of one of there most famous plays .

1 Not really , only what I half-remember from McTiernan 's audio commentary . There were certainly conventions that were applied throughout the industry , and McTiernan 's editor went behind his back to the studio to get him fired , thinking that the director had no idea what he was doing with the camera precisely because he was breaking these conventions . The commentary gives a fascinating insight in to the industry as well as how the film was made . One of the best I 've listened to .

1 A one written by a narcissist ?

1 Mail order . Peeta 's cakes are just that good .

1 You can get a good look at a butcher 's ass by sticking your head up there . But , would n't you rather to take his word for it ?

1 Warriorrrrrrrrrrsss ! Come out to play-ayyyyyyyyyy !

1 It 's all arbitrary anyway . The MPAA wants to feel like they 're doing something , so the editors cut out twenty seconds of gore and call it good for an R whether or not the actual substance of the film is changed . If the film had had an extra twenty seconds of footage , I 'm sure that they could have cut it down to the previous cut , gotten its R and moved on .

1 There 's no reason to keep running though . They allow him to escape so there 's no need for projections to chase them .

1 Screw this jerk who calls himself a film critic and never having seen Braveheart . Well , I 've never seen that comedy , Schindler 's List , for personal reasons such as one you cite . * `` There is a special place in hell reserved for filmmakers , like Gibson here and Oliver Stone in JFK , who rewrite history for the sake of making the bad guys all screaming stereotypes of effeminate homosexuals . '' * I bet you enjoyed seeing effeminate and bumbling Hitler in Inglourious Basterds , did n't you ? Especially that Hollywood wet dream of Hitler dying in the end . ; ) Hollywood loves bashing Germans for some reason when Germans are awesome ! ! !

1 Place Beyond the Pines was incredible .

1 I believe that is a 'weave . '

1 Right on robot . keep being a cool bot .

1 Seeing Yoshi chained up hit me where it hurts ...

1 Batman and Iron Man team up to take out criminals in LA . Everyone should know about it .

1 Not ... really . It was him and the rest of humanity in a pile of goo overcoming his issues so he could then leave the pile of goo to live in a desolate wasteland by his lonesome .

1 > trees Ahahaha ! This reminds me of my friend 's reaction to The Ninth Gate : `` What the hell did I just watch ? A movie about * books * ? ''

1 Yeah , I could n't figure that out . I think he might just be alluding to how the facility still had power , but all of it workers were dead . He knew something killed them . I ca n't figure out why he said it after he touched the crystal , though .

1 Yes because really its just a dude who made a list of his favourite movies and typically added a bunch of old classics he probable has never seen but he knows he is supposed to add . It just gets tiring looking for a bunch of obscure good movies and beeing unable to find because the same shit gets suggested again and again . Sublime , May , End of the Line , Dead End , Wind Chill ... There are gems out there but they are hidden because we only get the same shit again and again .

1 With the exception of Ewan who 's just having a goddamn ball .

1 The first thing I said was that that was my interpretation of the character , and most of that is n't opinion , it 's actually very important points of his character that have followed him between authors , through print , animation , and film , for years . TDK Joker was just very different . Do n't get so bitter because someone thinks differently than you , I never knocked Ledger 's performance of the role or the movie itself .

1 I can forgive you that . I ca n't forgive you not using Google to find out instead of writing a stupid comment . Yeah , people die everyday , but some people like this guy , so the news is important to them . But go on being callous .

1 seriously though , the way she flawlessly switches weapons and fighting styles , blows my mind .

1 If Michael Jai White and Terry Crews teamed up for a Black Dynamite 2 buddy cop movie , I think I could die a happy man .

1 > If all Neil Blomkamp ever does is ~~robot / scifi~~ Sharlto Copley movies I 'll be perfectly happy .

1 It 's alright , i 've come to peace with it just a little bit . Last sunday we thought was her last day , she basically did n't move all day . But she woke up on monday doing much better , and has been improving all week . Took her to the vet and got an X-ray , it 's a spleen tumor and he says she has maybe a month left , at the max . ( Unless it 's removed which he said would bring an extra 3-6 months ... for $ 3000 . Nope . ) But at this point she is n't in pain , can go on her daily walk , still plays with toys and eats just fine . So we 'll keep her as long as she is n't suffering . : (

1 but you posted that instead

1 It has huge wallpapers , though , up to 1024x768 !

1 Superman is awesome . Him being on cheat mode is the whole fun of the character - he 's basically God . He 's the embodiment of everything good about humanity with the power to try to fix things . The only angst he really seems to have is his own disappointment in himself for not being better .

1 The advantage is Star Trek loses JJ and gets a new director .

1 That actor ( Jesse Plemons ) played PSH 's son in The Master .

1 After watching Prisoners , I think Hugh Jackman could definitely pull off Joels transition from the beginning of the game to where he is as a person later on .

1 His voice is probably the only reason Toy Story ended up being such a good film . Woody is such a jerk , the only way he could be the same and be liked was with Tom Hanks doing the voice .

1 http : / i.imgur.com / jvsIqgz.gif

1 Armond White , too .

1 He could push for parents eating their children , and Reddit would support it .

1 I wish I had thought of such a great idea at some point over the last two years .

1 They make it seem like they actually filmed it in outter space

1 r / lakelaogai

1 He only * waits * for five minutes while they do their robbery bit . The driving takes however long it takes , and is not part of the five minutes he talks about .

1 Check on yourself . Thumb side of the hand , just above the wrist . Radial pulse . He is in the correct area .

1 I second this video ; very informative and jaw-dropping in connecting all of the dots .

1 Meanwhile , TheVeritableBalla enjoys watching Pineapple Express whilst high .

1 Stuck with me too !

1 It 's fine to watch now , but that 'to be continued ... ' In theaters killed me . I loved the action of reloaded , and I just wanted more of it right away .

1 hmmm ... ..NAAAAH

1 it 's fan made

1 The Cock beating up lions and serpents ? Sounds interesting to me .

1 yes but according to football manager you can mutually terminate them or your player or actor in this case will start missing practice and be grumpy until he gets to leave and it will make you look like dicks to not let him go and then other people will not want to sign for you .

1 Thanks man , it 's my finest work . Spent many days refining that sentence until it reached perfection .

1 MIB ride at Universal Studios . Zero wait in the single rider line , I repeated it until I managed to max out my score . I will never touch that ride again .

1 and look majestic doing it .

1 Never heard of it , I 'll have to check that one out .

1 k

1 It did allow for workers to demand wages and help break the feudal system because labor was in such low supply after the disease swept through .

1 Nobody knows !

1 Uhhhh ... .. I do n't know what secret they intend to reveal , but interstellar was n't particularly mysterious . Throughout the film they openly state the reasoning behind every plot point or character decision in clear English .

1 This sucks as does who made that bullshit . Do n't ever do that to us again .

1 Amazing trailer for my favorite film . Great use of [ Richard Strauss ' Also Sprach Zarathustra ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=oHbIS6va0NU ) as well .

1 You do n't really need to post a link because everyone knows what it looks like ... [ Buuuuut ] ( http : / static.guim.co.uk / sys-images / Film / Pix / pictures / 2008 / 09 / 26 / vertigo900.jpg )

1 title is most intense O_O seems to fit the description . that movie ruined my weekend multiple times . It 's one of the very few movies that just leaves me in a trance at the end I love it though

1 Checking in to say - I read it in his voice too ... . without even realising who he was : )

1 You have n't seen the movie , have you

1 A lot of the dialogue was pretty bad

1 I did not hit her , it 's not true , It 's bullshit , I did not hit her , I did not , oh hi Mark .

1 not that mocking of Jesus or religion , actually a lot more inspiring than actual church

1 Sorry ? Edit it dumbshit .

1 To this day he struggles to get work because of his inability to blink

1 That 's exactly what he did n't mean .

1 Seriously . She 's not a bad actress . The Butler was a hackneyed , scattershot movie , but the Oscar buzz for her performance was completely deserved . I think she 'd do really well as Amanda Waller .

1 He used to narrate lots of History Channel shows back when that channel used to have actual history documentaries .

1 Three months old , but it 's still the best trailer ever made . But according to the MPAA a trailer has a maximum runningtime of 2.30 minutes , so it 's called an 'extended first look ' .

1 I think being self aware is a great trait for a director , but at a certain point there 's a fine line between being self aware of your style and parodying what used to be your own sincere filmmaking . As to whether or not Tarantino has hit that point is up for debate , though I would agree that Django is a step towards the latter .

1 Yeah watching the trailer of Drive , it reminded of Taxi Driver . I will watch Drive after my finals are finished .

1 Well we never actually find out whether or not that works . I assumed the ending was supposed to be open .

1 Somewhere , derp_face is crying his heart out because of this comment .

1 One of the most amazing films I 've ever seen . The way the crew slowly starts to help Ben enact his crimes is a great commentary on the role of the observer in entertainment . It 's one thing to document someone doing something immoral , but it 's another thing entirely to actively engage in those immoral acts . I would recommend this film to anybody who can stomach it .

1 I think the prompt is `` * 10 * films that must be seen by every movie fan before they die ''

1 I did that too . Worm love .

1 Some of it is .

1 Yep , saw it in theaters and enjoyed it , kinda want to watch it again .

1 Modern Times . So easy to watch , extremely charming and actually still quite funny . Also , Paulette Goddard is super cute . And there 's a scene where Charlie does so much cocaine he can dodge bullets .

1 What I 've liked about Disney 's most recent 3D offerings is that they 've done a great job of making it actually look like a * Disney movie * . The character designs , they way they move . After Disney made the switch from 2D it really started to feel like they were just aping Pixars style . That said , I still wish they 'd put out a hand-drawn feature every now and then .

1 They filmed it in slow motion , so if they had just attempted to re-record the dialogue that way , Cate Blanchett would have had to slow down her speech to match the slow-motion footage . Since that would have been difficult , they took the original slow-motion footage , sped it up to normal motion for her to record at the same speed as she normally recorded it , and then slowed down her new dialogue recording to match the original slow motion footage .

1 You realize its based off a book that was written based on the events that took place on those mountains right ?

1 What ?

1 You are dead ( right ) Mr Bond !

1 > anybody who claims [ to ] fully understand what 's going on in Primer after seeing it just once is either a savant or a liar .

1 You beat me to it , and for that , an upvote.. Bye ! Have fun storming the castle !

1 Anyone ever heard of foreshadowing , it is found in 90 % of movies , deal with it .

1 No lasagna ?

1 My parents did n't `` let '' me watch it , it just happened to be on the channel . This was the early 90 's , and my mom was n't familiar enough with movie channels to know that something that graphic would be playing in the middle of the day . Not everything on reddit requires some rant against things .

1 Better than rehashing the ones already done by the Raimi films . Personally I 've been waiting for Electro for a while .

1 Who you calling an idiom ?

1 Dude , chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature . Asian-American , please .

1 Do n't say conclusion . DO N'T SAY CONCLUSION !

1 whoa , your post is too specific with a detailed background story !

1 Same here . Got ta love movie screenings . Laughed the whole way through . Jonah Hill tied up scene ... I almost cried laughing .

1 Oh my god , this movie was fucking incredible . Gyllenhaal 's performance was so disturbing that I was transfixed the entire runtime .

1 Sounds like a good place to hide your porn

1 Quentin Tarantino has dyslexia . I like to think that he kept it that way to force the world to use his spelling for a change or even just as a big `` fuck you '' to spelling in general .

1 you did n't like indigo Montoya ?

1 The Human Centerpiece ? Is that Martha Stewart remake ?

1 Or he could be still putting the makeup on ?

1 If it 's about assassinating him the say way Pineapple Express 2 was about assassinating Woody Harrelson , I think quite a few public figures would n't have a problem with it . But the premise of The Interview is that Kim has done lots of proper wrong ( which , to us , he has ) , not joke wrongs like Woody Harrelson 's speech to legalise weed . Not to defend Kim Jong-un , but I do believe he 's justified in feeling offended by the film . That 's not to say his crimes are n't even worse , though . But he 's still allowed to feel offended .

1 FUCK YEAH , NO SHAME . I LOVE EM ' TOO !

1 I was trying to say that without offending reddit , actually

1 What about Wet Hot American Summer ?

1 That has always been my favorite of the movies .

1 Why even bother commenting then ?

1 Not quite , here 's what he [ looks like ] ( http : / upload.wikimedia.org / wikipedia / en / 2 / 2e / Original_Gigan_1972.jpg ) .

1 taken from the subreddit info on the right side of the sceen : > To write spoilers , use the following method : [ spoiler ] ( / s '' Darth Vader is Yoda 's father '' ) but leave out the space between the bracket and the parentheses

1 Maybe in your state , but federal minimum wage is $ 7.25 / hour .

1 I believe Netflix 's contract ran out with that particular studio and they 've since signed a new one . I had n't noticed it on Instant for quite a while , at least not since I renewed my subscription more than a year ago .

1 Count Dooku is the last role I 'd use to announce Mr. Lee . If it 's got to be a newer film , I 'd use Saruman .

1 6 / 10

1 I do n't really have a problem with product placement , if it makes sense and does n't stick out . It 's all about the story , Sam Mendes can show bond drinking a heineken in a 2 second shot and it will annoy me . But make a Wilson Volleyball a main character with over 25 minutes screen time i wo n't only appreciate it , i 'll have a complete emotional breakdown when he gets lost . edit+ Tarantino does talk about mcdonalds a fair bit in Pulp Fiction .

1 http : / www.silentgarfield.com

1 past

1 Yeah , one way to save a failing career is to make a movie that says `` fuck you '' to the fans .

1 I really dug that movie , despite its significant flaws . Really , the bulk of the problems with Prometheus were with the script , which was a typical hack job by Damon Lindelof . Man , I 'm glad to see that guy 's star fading . The second one is being written by Michael Green , who wrote Green Lantern , so it should be much better . : -\

1 To be fair , I almost always get a laugh out of the niche they decide I like . `` Gritty British Detective Shows With a Dysfunctional Female Lead ''

1 When I said `` Indie '' I meant alternative from mainstream in terms of music , clothing , and activities ; and there 's nothing wrong with that . Maybe that 's how she really is , but often it seems like her characters are different just for the sake of being different . It 's just a personal preference , that 's what this whole thread is about .

1 I really hope this is n't like Snow White and the Huntsman

1 I dont think they over look emotional aspects , all of the movies chosen have the best emotional aspects this year as well , at least to me they do .

1 Fantastically surprised .

1 It 's like they 're not trying so hard because they actually were n't at all and someone has just successfully baited /r/HailCorporate .

1 [ Tarantino is all throughout this thread ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=NzY9a-WmE6o )

1 Well he had a bigger part , but it was cut out . It happened to a lot of actors in that movie , in fact Adrian Brody was the star in the original cut .

1 ( ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

1 I get the feeling from all the downvotes I 'm getting that people are missing my point . I do n't care if people like critically acclaimed movies or trashy movies do n't be a dick to people . Having better taste does n't give people a right to be assholes to others . Then again the elitist movie snobs are probably the ones downvoting me .

1 > I own a vagina . Really ? I 'm primarily a renter .

1 Not one of his best , but Ruffalo was pretty good .

1 No offence , but that is some seriously ignorant bullshit . http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / NASA_spin-off_technologies

1 Because , while he played a great pirate and wood elf , he would be the shittiest Ninja Turtle ever .

1 What is humanity , but another monster ?

1 That is the scene I always go to when I want to just up and quit my job on the spot and tell my boss off .

1 Yes

1 I just realized the guy who played Bennett was the same mohawk guy from Road Warrior and Weird Science !

1 Just go in knowing its a Seth Rogen movie . It has its moments . Hope you enjoy it !

1 `` Why am I even listening to you , you 're a virgin who ca n't even drive . '' Yeah , wicked burn .

1 Seriously . But then I get the impression these same fans would probably start bitching they did n't reuse their tea bags as compost . The Superman * I * know always recycles !

1 Oh okay . I 'm guessing that was his first win . I know for sure he did n't attend the Academy Awards when he won for The Godfather .

1 whaaaat : ( Damn , I feel way old now .

1 If you 've even visited Manhattan then Atlanta looks like a small town .

1 Buscemi .

1 You have to watch Flash Point starting Donnie Yen ! The fight scenes make you want to fight : D Perhaps not the best idea , but it 's that intense .

1 Ever dance with the Devil in the pale moon light ?

1 Action is clear and coherent . Characters have clear motivations and work to pursue them in a ( mostly ) logical manner . And those goals are more than `` drive giant robots ; bone hot chick I have a crush on '' . Understands that , to get your big action finale , you need to dial it back throughout the rest of the film and build up to it properly . More or less , Avengers is an action movie . It does n't try to be more . It does n't try to make you think . But it entertains , is easy to follow for any audience , and the action is clear because you know where you 're supposed to be looking and what to be looking at . It excels at being what it is . Micheal Bay just looks at any given shot and says , `` more explosions ... and show another giant robot in the background there doing something '' . It 's gratuitous .

1 a girl in full joker makeup sitting behind me cried for about 75 % of the movie . you are not alone .

1 I 'm female and I would acquit him . That is a sin against nature .

1 Sorry , but you are n't that special .

1 Such a fantastic movie , one of my favorites from 2013 . McConaughey and Leto give such incredible performances .

1 I feel Before Midnight , and the Before series in general , will have a longer lasting legacy than any other movie that came out this year . Like you said , it has truly been a flawless trilogy , and one of the finest displays of storytelling I 've seen in any medium , there 's no doubt that the Before series will go down as classic cinema .

1 : ( I was hoping I could reply with that ... well done .

1 That farmers one was great . Almost brought a tear to my eye .

1 They postponed it so that it could run with a * discussion panel event * instead of as an entertainment feature without discussion . Now instead of the movie being presented to a dumb , passive audience , they will present it in a context where they can critique , discuss , and talk back . I think you should curb your frustration and not fall for clickbait headlines .

1 No need with the intersect 2.0 . Except chuck does n't like guns .

1 * I do n't remember askin ' you a Goddamn thing ! *

1 It 's been many many years , and yet I can hear the music playing right now . edit : wow I just now saw the song is based on Piazzolla 's Libertango ! No wonder I remember , but now I 'm shaking my head that I never made the connection : /

1 Dat ultimate cut

1 You 're rubbing Ky jealous all over your dick

1 Affleck has taken a lot of shit in his career , and for good reason because he has made some terrible choices as an actor . After Daredevil , Gigli , and other questionable movies , he got back on track with the movies than you mention , OP . He also did a really good job as George Reeves in Hollywoodland , and I 'm guessing that he 'll do anything in his power to make sure , that he does n't end up in the place he were before Gone Baby Gone ect .

1 No , but you shared it , and what you shared is misinformation . `` What makes good cinebontopography ? '' `` RULE OF THIRDS ! '' is absolute rubbish . There 's so much more than that . If you said `` I really appreciate how well they incorporate framing -- here 's an example , '' or something , sure , whatever , but you did n't .

1 * Wosh *

1 iTunes has been landing a lot of in advance specials for movies as of late , that would probably be why !

1 I 've always been really moved by something he said in an interview not long before he died so tragically ... `` Because we do not know when we will die , we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well . Yet everything happens a certain number of times , and a very small number , really . How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood , some afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you ca n't even conceive of your life without it ? Perhaps four or five times more . Perhaps not even that . How many times will you watch the full moon rise ? Perhaps twenty . And yet it all seems limitless . ''

1 I understand that , obviously . But there are levels . Cartoons are often meant to be humanized , but you can get away with more cartoon violence than live-action violence because the suspension of disbelief is that much weaker with animation . Get my point ? Documentary violence would also be more shocking , and would probably be more harshly rated than a sci-fi , fantasy movie will be . I feel like this is really obvious stuff , and it 's weird that I 'm having to explain it .

1 I think she molested them . Their relationships were weird .

1 I 'm really interested in seeing it . My only experience with Pynchon is The Crying of Lot 49

1 Just watch the show again .

1 I always wished they would have made a tv series based on Sneakers .

1 From memory it ends mid-exorcism , just as heavy shit is going down , and the website does n't actually explain anything . It 's just a web1.0 site with character biographies and whatnot . Perhaps it 's explained in easter eggs or something , but nothing in the movie or the website really compelled me to go looking . It is a textbook case of how to fuck up though .

1 What the hell kind of child is reading books like `` Into the Wild '' ?

1 I DO N'T KNOW WHAT WE 'RE YELLING ABOOUUUTTTT ! ! !

1 As one of my all-time favorites to this day , I was really excited when I heard there was going to be Criterion Collection release for this movie . It 's been a while since I 've seen it so I think I 'll re-watch it . Thanks for the link !

1 Rosamund Pike was brilliant . Went into this movie only knowing about Affleck and she definitely stole the show . Alll in all a well directed movie with a great cast .

1 The problem with Michael Bay films is n't the action and it 's not the explosions . It 's all the bullshit that goes on between the action and the explosions . Of course it varies going film to film but when I watch Transformers , I want to watch giant robots kick the shit the out of each for 2 hours . I do n't want to see Shia LeBeouf , Megan Fox and the two parents trying to add comedy . I do n't want to see Fox 's replacement shake her ass while walking up stairs to provide fan service . I want robots in disguise destroying Chicago while we get awesome wingsuit sequences through all the wreckage . I do n't want to see a love triangle going on while Pearl Harbour gets bombed or Bruce Willis trying to kill Ben Affleck for nailing his daughter in Armageddon . When you take films like Dredd , Die Hard or pretty much any Arnie film , it does n't need to be strong on story . It just needs characters you can like , fighting villains you can hate , blowing everything around them up . No need for fan service , no need for romance and no need for comic relief .

1 I agree and dislike the amount of downvotes you 're getting . because really , did n't we say all that needs to be said with Beetlejuice ( have to call it `` 1 '' now ) ? ?

1 It 's not that hard tbh

1 Idk how a man that has so much knowledge of the business and was talking about himself , can run out of things to say .

1 The first time I saw it I did n't even notice that he was raping him . I had no idea what he was doing and did n't notice him thrusting into him . Ca n't believe I missed that the first time .

1 Something along the lines of 'accepting who you are ' and / or 'accepting your own limitations and doing the best you can anyway ' .

1 Love the before trilogy ! Had no idea it was based on real experiences .

1 I 'm glad i am not alone . That movie made me afraid that I 'd meet an alien and get quarantined in my house in a cold cell to die alone miserably . On top of that , I may turn pale white from sickness and have my sick read heart beating through my chest .

1 DC needs to understand they ca n't build an entire universe of dozens of films copying Nolan 's excellent but unrelentingly bleak films . A mega-franchise like this needs to be able to seamlessly interweave serious and comic components or people will just reach a point they ca n't take it any more .

1 It 's not a tooma

1 You can sell toys and have a great show at the same time , they 're not directly contradictory to each other . I mean hell , look at Japan in the late 70 's / early 80 's . Super Dimensional Fortress Macross and Mobile Suit Gundam where both blatant toy commercials , and they 're still hailed as classic examples of science fiction .

1 Man , that is depressing . I 'm wondering if kids who watch TV all the time are used to that certain modern look and ca n't appreciate the classics . It 's almost like when all they eat is super colorful and artificial processed foods that is all they want .

1 They 're not clueless about what people want to see . That 's why all they make is Spiderman and Sandler . If the general audience paid to go see films with substance they 'd happily never make a Grown Ups 3 .

1 The king 's speech 2 you got ta be fucking kidding me ...

1 I liked it in 1996 when I was 15 . It does not hold up . The only good performance in the whole bag of shit was Anthony Hopkins , which is n't surprising . Ugh , Brad 's dry peroxide hair !

1 Nick and Cage ?

1 * iasip

1 I do n't know . Thor and Thor : The Dark World have consistently been setups and I 've never felt like they can stand on their own in the Marvel oeuvre .

1 > But seriously : All the President 's Men . Agreed , although the scene with Deep Throat was highly exaggerated . The famous line , `` follow the money , '' was not said by ether party . Instead , Woodward says to Sen . Sam Ervin : `` The key was the secret campaign cash , and it should all be traced . '' Just as interesting is the drama behind the scenes . William Goldman 's script was hated by Redford , Bernstein , and Woodward . Bernstein and his girlfriend , Nora Ephron ( yes , the same Ephron who wrote You Got Mail and When Harry Met Sally ) , wrote a draft that Goldman and Woodward hated . Later , Pakula and Redford rewrote the Goldman 's script , but gave him the credit .

1 I still think MK gets more shit then it deserves . It was n't THAT bad , not nearly as bad as the sequel or the horrendous live action TV show .

1 It might be only the mind stone that is like that . In the sense that it 's the distilled essence of Mind , and has a lot of resemblance to a brain or computer . Jarvis said it was something `` more like a computer '' , rather than outright calling it one . Ultron does seem to be derived from what they were able to extract from analysing the mind stone , integrated with a pre-existing `` Ultron Project '' which was abandoned at some point before this movie began .

1 What ... ..that he is wearing a Jurassic Park shirt in the Jurassic Park movie ?

1 That made me laugh a lot

1 Yes . A movie based on Dory 's life will surely include less Dory .

1 But audiences confuse film with reality . People in my theater were clapping and laughing when Iraqis died in the film . This is n't just fictionalizing reality , it 's a dangerous form of propaganda . No doubt this movie could set back relations or world views of people in America ( or potentially elsewhere ) towards Middle Easterners .

1 I went in expecting the movie to be bad and was still surprised at how shitty it ending up being .

1 John Francis Daley is directing and both Martin Starr and Samm Levine are making cameos so , kinda .

1 Thank you for encapsulating what happens every time I go to that site and why I am so confused as to the draw . It 's the site for the type of people who when they go to a Wikipedia article immediately start reading the `` In Modern Culture '' section and lose their shit if the 15 th anime reference in the Jesus Christ article 's In Modern Culture section were removed .

1 I 'm also curious . They 're great flicks , some of Dreamworks ' best of recent years , but in terms of cleverness ( and heck , even overall movie quality ) , Shrek is in a league of its own for Dreamworks .

1 * Feem toon

1 Oh jesus fuck that 's sad .

1 Let the children have their circle jerk ... It 's not like MTV has any influence or cultural bearing on anyone over the age of 13 anyways ...

1 good lighting ref for the artist

1 Agree 100 % . He could be so much more than just an irobot , a pirate , or a veal .

1 Wow , well fucking done . The tension was palpable with those criminals . This is how Neil Blomkampf got his start and I can see real talent and nuance in this . 8 / 10 Goslings .

1 I 'm a sophomore in college . I got the tickets to the advance screening through my campus film club .

1 `` Watched '' it . edit : So you guys think you can `` watch '' a film in fast forward ?

1 > The movie does n't get any less weird , you just get fully absorbed into the setting that you just accept it as right . `` Okay . This is the world now . ''

1 And Willy Wonka

1 Oh yeah , Saruman was the schoolboy always trying to play catch-up . Always tried to put Gandalf down to make himself seem better , but always envious of him , and paranoid .

1 almost everyone ? Nope . Many did not like the movie , many many others liked it just fine . It still has the second highest `` user '' score on metacritic among all wide releases right now .

1 they usually end in the 2s . 1992,2002,2012,2022 ... .

1 Go watch Airplane ! right now . Classic funny movie . It 's on Netflix .

1 Glengarry Glen Ross is a shit movie ? Lacks in tension ? Did you expect it to end in a giant shootout or something ?

1 Apart from it says all the figures are inflation adjusted at the top ...

1 truly truly outrageous

1 Yeah the VHS had it too .

1 Yeah , I never really liked the Mickey stories . They where all kinda ... dull ? The magazine was ( is ? ) still named after the mouse though .

1 Cloud Atlas has an awesome score due to the musical content of the film and multiple settings .

1 Did n't he already play Bond ?

1 It does mean something though , his resurrection has meant more than his death did .

1 funny was just talking about that movie today with my regular coffee vendor for some reason . Of course we talked about the scene where Rae Dawn Chong teaches the more primitive human how to make love face to face .

1 You say that like it 's a bad thing

1 why do you call this the Michael Douglas question ? the article does n't even mention him . and he was in lots of good movies : The Game , Wall Street , King of California , Falling Down etc .

1 i know right , Smaug Extended edition was a drag , terrible movie experience , and im being serious , there is even like 12 extra minutes of the lord of laketown discussing local politics with his lackey , while he eats balls .

1 Unzip your fly and show them your thing .

1 Could you elaborate on what confused you ? I might be able to explain some things , but I 'm not entirely sure what you want to know .

1 I believe it 's Hawkguy . / s

1 My comment was a joke . Oldman is obviously cast in a bunch of roles ...

1 Overly complex words as in words that dont seem like they fit into natural conversation . Some words and phrases sound great in writing , but just sound clunky in dialogue . It made sense for Malkina I guess because of the way her character was , but not so much for the other guys .

1 Raimi 's Drag Me to Hell .

1 > The Hulks are n't part of the MCU Hulk is not . The Incredible Hulk ( 2008 ) most certainly is part of the MCU

1 On what planet is Spartacus , Paths of Glory , or Barry Lyndon considered strange ?

1 On a similar note , back in the early 2000s , a start-up animation studio tasked with developing a feature-length CG animated Ninja Turtles burned down early into pre-production and they lost everything . I remember the concept stills they were showing off looked like ass , so it 's more likely that the owner burned it down to collect the insurance and get out of the contract rather than a lesson in proper version control . But even still , it serves as a sharp reminder : always keep your back ups off-site .

1 Well , that Inception slow-mo scene had a purpose for being slow-mo , so that 's probably why you did n't mind it .

1 * SPOILERS * [ Richard Grieco & Will Ferrel ] ( / spoiler )

1 I love Sam Rockwell and enjoyed Vanko 's motivation . It was more emotional and different than other villains .

1 You could not throw a briefcase that straight out of a vehicle at high speeds . Also , as seen in the frame by frame , the brief case is n't actually thrown in the window , it hits the door and the shadows create the illusion .

1 > Watching a butthurt fanboy rant about how awful he thought a good movie was is a waste of my time . the irony

1 YES ! Oh , and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , of course . Those two movies always make me think of each other .

1 > Secret Window or The Number 23 I need more movies like these in my life

1 It puts the lotion on its skin

1 Yes , it was so close to the original style Speed Racer cartoons . It was amazing .

1 If he 's going to play a terrorist in this day and age , I 'd prefer that he does n't look like a typical Chinese person . That 's an association I could live without . If he 's going to portray one of the Western Chinese ethnic minorities , then the terrorist thing seems a bit more realistic since that 's closer to Pakistan and Afghanistan .

1 This is the End was a very funny movie . It was a lot different than The Worlds End looks . I 've seen this phenomenon too but this example just seems like a happy coincidence .

1 thanks man , its just downvotes , i think ill be ok

1 Besides getting an hj when i was 15 , it was the best movie going experience I 've ever had .

1 He really can . Hey , at least he does n't run lke [ Seagal . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=nkskuSXqUD0 )

1 Man of Steel . The first flight is amazing , and a highlight of the film . I really love the film . One of the better origin story comic book films recently , bested only by Iron Man . IMO , of course . But people , as far as I can tell , hated it because it changed the lore . A lot .

1 the gun-crossed tat is outstanding .

1 It actually had a lot going for it : based on Shakespeare 's Taming of the Shrew , great soundtrack ( Letters to Cleo ! ) , fun cast , and it put Heath Ledger on the map . Overall it was my go to movie of the 90 's .

1 Fuuuuuuck , this looks good .

1 I lost it at the bake sale crack

1 It looks like it could be extremly violent . Which I 'm ok with if it has the right amount of `` gore '' . Just slightly under Sabotage .

1 Hearts * of Darkness : A Film Maker 's Apocalypse

1 Les intouchables is really good

1 Dredd is the kind of movie made to have sequels . It 's based on a comic book with loads of stories . We 're not talking about Fight Club here .

1 What ?

1 Chill out , dickwad .

1 AHHHHH I GET IT ! FUCK IT HAVE AN UP VOTE

1 Oh boy , I have a feeling people are n't going to like your comment

1 dooooooooooooooooooook dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooook ! ! !

1 There 's a British documentary called the Up Series that follows a bunch of kids . I think they started when they were seven and reconnect every seven years to make another episode , checking up on how their lives have gone . I think the group are 49 now , so they 've done a bunch of episodes . It 's one of those things I 've been told to watch but have n't got around to yet .

1 Buncha liberal bullshit . If there is no renewal * THEN HOW DID YOU GET HERE ? *

1 It 's a little soon to have watched Mud 10 times , is n't it ? You just have a thing for a coked out McConaughey ?

1 IMDb ratings have always been a joke .

1 to be fair , i love the book but think it 's just about impossible to adapt EVERYTHING that it encompasses into a movie . If anything , it seems more suited to an HBO serial or something . I actually thought the movie did a very good job , given the material and Hollywood 's obvious breath on the director 's neck .

1 The dog got the most votes so he technically won but they scrapped it . Just like ron paul in iowa

1 Especially if she had a beard

1 It 's said when nathan fillion pulls the string on his woody doll .

1 Yes ! Finally someone else puts Nebraska at number 1 ! My top ten : 10 ) Monsters University 9 ) American Hustle 8 ) Dallas Buyers Club 7 ) Gravity 6 ) This Is The End 5 ) The World 's End 4 ) Captain Phillips 3 ) Her 2 ) Inside Llewyn Davis 1 ) Nebraska

1 Quality .

1 Because it lists the movies in the order they come out .

1 > Yeah lets just make the only black superhero an Indian . LOL man you need to get your races right . The Rock is Black / Samoan .

1 Idris was ( and is ) fantastic in The Wire and Luther . Always excited when he 's attached to projects . Looks great in Pacific Rim as well .

1 I love the cuss out of that movie !

1 Like deadpool from xmen origins ?

1 and there are quite a few Hong Kong films that might be of interest , particularly during the 80s-90s Heroic Bloodshed days . * City on Fire * Full Contact * Prison on Fire * The Killer * Hardboiled * A Better Tomorrow * A Bullet in the Head * The Club * Organized Crime and Triad Bureau * Rock and Roll Cop * Crime Story ( with Jackie Chan ) * Election * Fulltime Killer * PTU * The Mission * Throwdown * The Big Bullet * Infernal Affairs I-III * A World Without Thieves

1 > I do n't know if it 's NBC as a whole It 's NBC as a whole . IIRC for a while they had a lot of their shit on Hulu . Thank goodness * some * shows and people understand the Internet . Comedy Central in general is great about having their stuff available online somewhere ( whether on their own website or on an independent website for the show ) .

1 ... that sound like a herd of buffalo rolling across the plains .

1 I would like to see him having a semi drunk arguement with Lando `` Did n't Greedo get the drop on you ? '' `` Hell no ! I got him right where I wanted him ! ''

1 Was n't what I was getting at but that 's extremely valid . Mosquitoes = humans , buzzing around being no more than pests .

1 Why would she regret doing that film ?

1 Yeah . Imagine if they did . They 'd probably have some jerk like M. Night come in and wreck the whole thing with badly cast actors . Good thing that would never happen .

1 He directed the shit out of Into The Wild

1 Gay man here . Can confirm . We love the pussy .

1 Clerks , Blair Witch Project , Paranormal Activity , Saw .

1 No Hollywood studio executive with an eye on recent history would see it that way , though . * Man of Steel * was always intended to be the lead-in to a series of DC universe films , and by now we know that the first film in any such series is at a disadvantage . It comes out , gets publicity and hopefully a bunch of people go see it , and then the `` universe '' builds off box office success / DVD release / Netflix to pull even bigger numbers on the sequel / s . So it 's more realistic to compare MoS against * Batman Begins , * * Iron Man , * * Thor , * and * Captain America * than their respective sequels . Once you do that , it 's apparent that MoS ' box office exceeded the take of even the most lucrative among these by $ 83 million . By the numbers : - * Batman Begins : * $ 375 million -- * The Dark Knight : * $ 1 billion -- * The Dark Knight Rises : * $ 1 billion - * Iron Man : * $ 585 million -- * Iron Man 2 : * $ 624 million -- * Iron Man 3 : * $ 1.2 billion - * Star Trek : * $ 385 million -- * Into Darkness : * $ 467 million - * Thor : * $ 450 million -- * Thor : The Dark World : * $ 633 million - The * Captain America * sequel has n't been released yet , but that film did $ 370 million . * Winter Soldier * will almost certainly do more when it comes out in April . - * Avengers * did $ 1.5 billion , but that , too , was effectively a sequel to the existing Marvel films . * Man of Steel * did $ 668 million . In other words , it actually did better than every other `` starter '' film named above , and the WB is well aware of that . We can argue the merits of the film back and forth ( though personally [ I think it has a lot going for it ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/changemyview / comments / 1lbmj6 / i_feel_like_superman_is_the_most_mary_sueish_hero / cbya1h5 ) , even if it 's not a perfect movie ) , but there 's really no way to argue that MoS did n't exceed expectations . It 's going to build off its own hype and the existing Nolanverse Batman ( even if that version of Batman is n't actually the one we 'll see in the film ) , so WB can reasonably anticipate some insane cash flow in the near future assuming no one screws the pooch . * TL : DR * Superman is still the biggest of the big dogs and WB is hearing the not-so-distant * Ka-ching ! Ka-ching ! Ka-ching ! *

1 That was not the Steve McQueen I expected .

1 `` Often '' is a stretch .

1 Do n't worry , it sucked badly in 3d too .

1 Dredd was so fucking great . No character development but shit man it was such a cool , well written action movie and Karl Urban was just fantastic .

1 Tell em ...

1 12 Monkeys is another good example ...

1 The Machinist .

1 `` The Truth '' ha

1 This article is 4 years old .

1 You think you had it bad ? I always thought the quote was from the movie Contact , with Jodie Foster ... when the the billionaire shows her the primer . I had absolutely no idea why it was so popular .

1 Coz they need to introduce all the infinity Gems .

1 Honestly it 's hard to tell . The show is as if a bunch of porn stars + reject actors + Tommy got together to make some sort of sitcom . It is kind of similar to The Room though , I found it to be very funny .

1 Ca n't watch , video 's private..

1 Very aesthetically pleasing

1 As long as he had a catchy catch phrase like `` Weesa gon na blow up dis here third death star ''

1 ... time for something completely different .

1 He 's calmly staring into my souuuuuulll ! ! !

1 I 'd watch that movie

1 The narration is essential to this film . It 's largely about celebrity and the way we build up these people into larger than life fictional characters . We are listening to this narration that tells us the legend of Jesse James that at times does n't seem to match up with what we 're seeing on screen . One example is the narrator telling us about how often Jesse blinks while we 're shown a shot of him staring without blinking . This theme also comes up in one of my favorite scenes : When Robert is litening to the man in the bar singing about Jesse and his three children ( when in reality he only had two ) .

1 It is my favorite with Pierce Brosnan . Good story with a good villain and not way over the top like his other movies .

1 Then there 'd be a couple samples from other popular tracks at the time . * I 'm after the gold and after that the platinum ! * * For all of y'all ! * * Bow wow wow , yippie yo , yippie yay ! * Kick , clap , a-kick kick , clap .

1 The article is about how much the movies they stared in grossed , not about how much the actors were paid

1 Actually Peter Jackson Fucks You ! And Me . : (

1 We were n't allowed to fill any containers other than the company provided ones * . They keep inventory just so that they can count the number of missing popcorn buckets vs the amount of buckets sold through the Point-of-sale stations to make sure that none went missing . They ca n't actually track how much literal popcorn was consumed by guests . At the end of the day we had trashbags full of popcorn to get rid of , so they use the buckets as a way of detecting how much product was sold . So they get pissed if a bunch go missing because it throws off their count . * We got around this problem whenever we came in to watch movies for ourselves by asking for `` the cardboard special . '' We 'd take those cardboard carrying trays with the embedded cup holders and just pour popcorn on top of them and take them into the theatre with us .

1 Your loss .

1 He 's criticizing `` 28 * weeks * later '' .

1 THAT WAS AWESOME

1 From the looks of that , Johnny Depp could have played her role in Ironweed .

1 But TMNT was a popcorn flick ... just fun without much substance ... `` foam '' as Verne put it ... whereas GotG was a great quality movie all around .

1 You guys seem to be friends .

1 Christ I feel old . I remember watching the episode of the Cosby show he guest starred on , which was his last appearance , the week he died .

1 Thank you for your contribution .

1 considering how many people have read the book and / or seen the original , I thought this was a good way to go

1 Really loved the bit near the beginning of 2061 where he explores how life on Earth has changed over the prior fifty years as a consequence of night not being a thing anymore .

1 Rocky .

1 Have n't yet , but I will put it on my list . Currently I have : * SUNSET BOULEVARD * DOUBLE INDEMNITY * THE MALTESE FALCON * THE BIG SLEEP * THE ASPHALT JUNGLE

1 I watched that movie ON ACID and it sucked . ON . FUCKING . ACID .

1 You should see Buried . It certainly changed my whole perspective on him . Guy can act .

1 Puerto Rico is n't a country .

1 Still looks like Gramdpa Munster .

1 I 'd personally prefer it be a predecessor to the X-Wing , anyway . Seems silly Anakin would pilot the exact same model ship to win races that his son uses to win wars in the future .

1 The characters in episode 1 were two dimensional , what development do you mean ?

1 Generally Criterion does an excellent job of restoration .

1 > What are examples of famous actors who made a shit directorial debut ? It was n't exactly when he became really famous , but a lot of people do n't like Jack Nicholson 's Drive He Said , Ethan Hawke had a pretty bad directorial debut , and The Lost City was pretty horrible .

1 Because Christian Bale also played Batman .

1 But ... it did n't ? I love GOTG , but it was pretty much led by Star Lord . We actually saw his back-story , and learned about pretty much everyone and everything else through him . He brought that team together .

1 Justin Timberlake singing The Killers in Southland Tales .

1 Like a pokemon evolution .

1 Except when explaining the punchline is what 's supposed to be funny about the joke .

1 He very clearly said that it was n't .

1 My bladder was at serious critical mass for the last half hour of that film . I was walking like Quasimodo to the bathroom when it was over .

1 Sad you feel that way . I absolutely love her novels and even more so the film adaptations of them . Something about them is so soothing to me .

1 He said Lacey Chabert because Mila Kunis replaced her as Meg on Family Guy . It would actually be funny if they did that .

1 You low life piece of shit scumbag . One of the last movies I was looking forward to this year , you fucking spoiled it . I hope you get get banned from this subreddit . I hope you yet banned from all of reddit . From me , to you ; fuck your meaningless life .

1 Just a reminder that Hollywood is controlled by a few choosen people who do n't want to educate you , they just want to feed you whatever filth you 're willing to buy that will make them money . You really should n't even blame hollywood . This is the consumers who keep buying unoriginal franchises instead of seeking out original and thought-provoking content .

1 I think part of that is intentional , he 's supposed to be straight-laced and wooden . Inception is in part like Wizard of Oz . Eames is the tin man , who `` lacks a heart '' in not really caring what the effects on Fisher 's memories are as long as they do the job . He goes from that to really wanting to see Fischer 's redemption with his father , and is genuinely satisfied at the end that they have made Fischer a better person . Yusuf is the lion . He goes from `` I rarely enter the field '' to a ridiculous , action-packed car chase . And Arthur is the scarecrow . He `` lacks imagination '' and needs to `` dream a little bigger '' . But he comes up with an extremely creative solution in the elevator .

1 I 've seen the animated titanic . Never again ...

1 It 's TPB , it 's not supposed to look well done .

1 I think they were laughing at the overly dramatic way Ken Watanabe said his name .

1 People often call this the cock block scene . But I think Mature_Gambino mentioned it because of how it highlights the humanity of the series . A lot of the latter parts of Harry Potter are quite shocking because when you read the first novels the stake do n't seem that high . Yet , by 4th book or so you are already emotionally invested and the story takes a very dark and adult turn . Essentially from the end of Prisoner of Azkaban onwards the series gets really depressing . The dance sequence is one of the few happy moments . So it is intended to be poignant . Kind of like the situation is so bad that the happiness of goofing off with a friend becomes very emotional .

1 I would have gone for alan alda

1 I noticed in a scene on the airship one of the guys has a little microphone sitting on his desk , it was the same Logitech mic I 've had for years now . Prop guys had their hands full with that movie I guess

1 Pumpkinhead ! Definitely .

1 The Hudsucker Proxy was such a great stylized movie that I never see people mention .

1 This is making me laugh way more than it should be

1 `` Talented '' ... pffff good one !

1 Hannibal !

1 That was n't acting . That 's just who Samuel L. Jackson is now .

1 `` He is iron bloke . He stomps about and bothers folks . ''

1 Not worried at all , the director is the same guy that directed the 2min test footage that had everybody including me in complete AWE . Ryan Reynolds is a big fan and has been championing this movie to be made for a LOT of years , you mentioned the great writers ! Did you see the test footage that got this movie greenlit ? ( they say )

1 one smooth troll

1 The `` traditionally pretty '' look . I 'm not gon na say Woodley is n't good looking , obviously she is pretty . But she 's just not Mart Jane pretty . Traditionally , Mary Jane has bigger , noticeable green eyes , petite nose , and dimples . That 's how the most famous Spider-Man artist John Romita drew her and that 's how she looked in her first appearance . Gwen actually fits this description too , but that 's because both of their appearances were defined by Romita .

1 Yeah ... That super overlooked movie that 's made over $ 250 mil at the box office ...

1 well , our chickens were mostly just for the eggs , so the few times we ate them , it was when they got old , were n't producing eggs , or were attack-chickens ( the spurs on some of the roosters are fucking murderous ) . They were really tough and not particularly tasty . However , if you eat them right when they reach adulthood , or if you buy chickens specifically bred to be tasty ( frier chickens ) , they are the most delicious chickens you could possibly eat . We raised some of these on two occasions and smoked them , roasted them , fried them , and baked them . I have never , nor will I ever eat a tastier chicken than those that my family raised . A good example of a really tasty very small bantam-sized chicken is those Cornish game hens at the grocery store . That 's the size of a bantam chicken and they are delicious . That is what my family eats for Christmas , actually . We get like 3 or 4 of those game hens and chow down .

1 Well I 'm glad we can get away from that ridiculous torpedo chase and egg story and get back to something more believable , like an evil giant moth or giant flying turtle with jets coming out of its shell .

1 That 's what Bilbo Baggins hates !

1 It won those awards for a reason .

1 Except it was way more complicated to do 20 years ago .

1 I would pay so much to see that . Jason Statham as Peter , his right hand man . Directed by Guy Richie . Oh the possibilities . Tom fucking Wilkinson as Pontius Pilate ?

1 I thought we were choosing movies that everyone hated .

1 Pretty sure you meant Moon ( 1994 ) , not 1993 .

1 `` The scourer of Carp * aaah * thia ... . the sanitation of Mold * aaah * via ... ''

1 Wow , that 's the only time I 've heard of people clapping in a theater when it makes sense to do so .

1 DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS ! !

1 Austin , TX apparently .

1 As a kid I loved the short adventure story that opened up any 007 film , but as far as what I think is the best opening sequence ever ... ... The runner up is , [ Watchmen ] ( http : / www.videolog.tv / video.php ? id=417824 ) And the winner is , [ Contact ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=PLQF-4uyD4Y )

1 I 've not read through comics or the likes but the first thing that came to mind when I saw that was `` I thought he stopped making suits ? ... after a fireman almost killed him and his bird ... and he went into space ... to nuke aliens ... by hand . Yeah he 's going to build the strongest fucking thing he can that can get to him as fast as fucking possible . Dude 's terrified . ''

1 But he did it with * style * petite

1 That made me miss the Need for Speed : Underground games . Riced out 240SX with neons and a soundtrack featuring Lil Jon ? What could better capture the early 2000s than that ?

1 Really ? I though Geoffrey Rush was pretty awesome .

1 Could be hidden in his pants

1 Yeah , I saw Akira rescreened at the Alamo Drafthouse . Much better experience than watching at home .

1 Joking right ? Otherwise you 're one special mofo

1 I 'm with you . I did n't think it was a bad movie ( I recently watched the Kilmer / Brando Island of Dr Moreau , that 's a bad movie ) , but it was n't as remarkable as I was expecting . The tone was weird because it felt like some people were taking the situation very seriously the way old kaiju movie characters did , but on the other hand , so much was goofy as hell .

1 Yeah , with all these idiotic parrot comments , I would n't be surprised .

1 Is n't the point of Judge Dredd to point out the flaws of a police state ? This would be one of them . Also , they would appear to have more than just a drug charge given the most likely illegal weapons being possessed by more than one individual . It would also appear that they shot only the ones with weapons .

1 It definitely has dramatic elements , but it 's also really funny , like the majority of Wes Anderson 's films .

1 Well ... Amazing Spider-Man 2 , in my opinion , can not really be compared to Cap 2 . As movies , Cap 2 is better . But as comic book characters they are so different that comparing them , outside of them being movies , is not right . Spidey would not suit the tone set by The Winter Soldier at all . They totally nailed the tone of Amazing Spider-Man 2 and set a new standard for action sequences , I think . Some of the most visually beautiful and dynamic action scenes I 've ever seen that felt like they were ripped straight from a Spider-Man comic that perfectly suited him as a character .

1 > mark whalberg to represent hackers , like wtf . This guy played Thor dude , what .

1 breaking the rules is okay if you 're the good guy , bad if you 're the bad guy . sweeping the leg was against the rules as it was `` below the belt '' prohibited by the ref . but he also prohibited head shots . that crane kick was nothing if not a kick to the face .

1 Marvel shit man . Based on their current plans , there will be at least 40 Marvel movies and tv shows between 2010 and 2020 . Like fuck that 's a lot of Marvel movies .

1 I love the IMDb description : `` The violent story about how a criminal lesbian , a tough-guy hit-man with a heart of gold , and a retarded man came to be best friends through a hostage . ''

1 D'oh , silly me . I ca n't believe I forgot that . Well , people may have not seen Pocahontas Dances With Ferngully , so I guess we can kind of forgive them ?

1 Tears from the tip of your penis ?

1 Was more dangerous

1 And does she play a sexually deviant misanthrope ?

1 weak privilege

1 Yeah but the snarky reviews will be epic !

1 The dog ...

1 If you made it more close to the books in a television format , it would work .

1 Rotten Tomatoes , I believe , either already has a feature like this or did something similar briefly where they tried to rate movie stars based on the movie 's they are in . The reason it 's flawed is because , aside from it being RT , a good score for a movie does n't automatically mean that an actor contributed to that score , nor that that score is a valid reflection of the quality of that movie ( it 's people with good taste and people with poor taste voting on the same thing with the same arbitrary system that does n't ask them to explain what their reasoning is ) , and it also does n't take into account that actors who might be good that do n't get work for any number of reasons , including being typecast , their economic situations , their racial backgrounds , etc . In other words , at best it 's completely irrelevant information , and at worst it 's actually kind of mean .

1 I 'm not sure if we can say if it would be better or worse , but the movie would n't work the same way . I think a lot of people are forgetting that this is a movie , not the book . It can be different , and probably should be for a number of reasons . It 's an adaption of existing material , but the people making it can and should put something of their own into it . The problem with using different characters is that it adds ambiguity to the story . In some movies and many books ambiguity works well . Ambiguity in certain parts worked well in this movie , but it was clear that the directors wanted to connect the stories explicitly , to leave no doubt about how the stories are connected ; reincarnation , intertwining souls crossing each other through time , loving , hurting , killing saving each other again and again . That would n't be clear with different characters . It could have been implied , but I 'm not sure the implication could be any more subtle than using the same characters without just being spoon fed . The alternative would be for it to be ambiguous , and probably not in a good way . The Wachowski and Tykwer clearly wanted to weave the stories together using the actors / actresses as the thread and they injected their own themes and statements into the movie that differ somewhat from the book . To be honest , in a couple of years ( or tomorrow ... ) I would n't mind seeing a `` remake '' , or another adaption that tried it with different characters . But that does n't mean that this adaption is n't a valid one .

1 Let 's fighting love ?

1 I spent $ 2 seeing that about 4 years ago in a local cinema . The ticket purchase included a medium popcorn and soft drink . Best $ 2 I 've spent in my life .

1 I was shocked when I saw this film was being made . I 'm an asshole cynic who thinks this movie will be hilarious , but I think this is career suicide for Eisenberg . McBride , Swardson , and Ansari are relatively unknown outside of comedies . Jesse blew up with The Social Network and he 's going to get so much bad press for this . Will it be funny ? Yeah , probably . I 'll enjoy it . I just think it was a stupid decision to play this so close to the vest . They could have easily made a movie around a similar premise without being so obvious . No pizza delivery guy , no kidnapping , no bomb , they could have done something . This is essentially a literal adaptation .

1 Also * Rozencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead * is a good Oldman / Roth flick .

1 I can imagine that . Ashton Kutcher moonwalking away from explosions . Yep , I can imagine it , but I definitely would n't pay money to watch it .

1 The only things they have in common really is space . One is a cerebral abstract arthouse movie while the other is a mainstream sci-fi action film

1 It makes more sense in the real world because there is n't magic and there are n't sentient balls .

1 > Who says actors should get paid millions of dollars ? The free market .

1 I loved the India-story flash backs . Also , I cry like a baby every time .

1 You must watch movies that Birdman is a satire of .

1 Totally agree . This was made more frustrating by the fact that they had an awesome platform to provide an earnest depiction of mental health issues , but fell really short in their execution .

1 Yeah , not really .

1 Pity he could n't have found a more expressive lead than Ryan O'Neal .

1 When I saw 500 Days of Summer , my girlfriend at the time could n't believe she had been wrong all of those years since she first saw the Graduate . It was kind of embarrassing for her , but it passed quickly .

1 You actually check the structure in Tarantino movie ? I bet you have n't seen Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill yet , otherwise you 'd be singing a very different tune .

1 Tonal shifts , poor acting , little characterisation with also inconsitent characterisation and accents , frustrating editing , poor sound dub ( in the original ) over bearing sets , poor costumes for the prisoners and Yutani guards , inconsistent shots , poor composit effects for the climax , That terrible slow mo flair , under written finale and the terrible POV of the alien reducing it to Jason Vorhees kind of argues against that statelement .

1 Maybe the same way he finds planets through trillions of miles of empty space . This is not hard to believe , at all . Its Green Lantern for godsake

1 A Serbian Film is on the list , I believe , but there 's an error with the way the link is displaying .

1 hey man fuck you I loved that movie

1 Sure , but no , those are both examples of different universes . I 'm fairly certain Suicide Squad will exist within the Batman / Superman movie universe , meaning so will Green Lantern -- who is no longer played by Ryan Reynolds . The Fantastic Four movies Chris Evans was involved with has been done with for a while , before he became Captain America . Point is , Will Smith would be playing two characters in the same continuity / cannon . They wo n't allow that , I imagine .

1 If you have n't tried Juan in a Million ( East of downtown , on Cesar Chavez ) , it 's very much worth a visit .

1 Yeah , it would have to be altered ... or could be a period piece , set in the 80 's , when arcade games were still popular . This way , it could keep the campy fun intact while giving a huge facelift on the effects .

1 There are studies done , though , that say that such adoration lets girls explore the concept of a relationship in a safe and distant manner without the risk of emotional or physical pain . This is so very different from a guy building a pedestal for a girl and when she 's not a goddess , just human , he despises her for it . Very , very different .

1 The gas leak was a way for Harmon to explain the out-of-character choices the writers made in Season 4 . It 's a funny way to reference the year and dismiss a lot of the actions when Harmon came back . He did n't like how the characters were changed ... He even made a point to reference it in the first s5 episode where Jeff points out how they all behaved differently the previous year .

1 I heard Audiard rushed to get this film ready in time for Cannes . I would n't be surprised if he re-edited the third act a bit , since thats where most of the film 's criticism is directed to .

1 I 've always been a fan of Pootie Tang 's dialogue . I honestly do n't even remember what the movie was about .

1 Woot ! The Astor ! Best projection I have ever seen was when I went and saw The Final Cut in digital projection at The Astor . It was so crisp and perfect it ruined me for any other movie I 've seen in a theatre . The next time I went to see Blade Runner at the Astor was just a standard reel that must have donethe rounds , it was ... disappointing . OT : Totally tempted to go see Lawrence of Arabia there this weekend .

1 I really just think it 's because it 's the first teaser . There 's definitely hints of a musical in this and I highly doubt they 're going to try and hide that fact once actual trailers start rolling out .

1 That whole movie is one beautiful scene .

1 Yeah , if someone 's never seen a James Bond movie before .

1 Man you 're right . Make the ghost army melt people 's faces like the ark of the covenant .

1 I think Vader 's Fist were made into canon .

1 worst film to watch on drugs .

1 Yeah , being able to talk about the film with it fresh in your mind is nice , but with my friends , we are constantly talking about movies , so it 's not that big a deal to talk about them immediately .

1 I will settle halfway with a naked Willy Wonka .

1 Green screened does n't mean it was CGI . The background was placed behind him via green screen , but I 'll be the background was mostly real footage .

1 They do but slightly . With high velocity rifles firing tracers you can observe it but it 's only noticeable if you 're standing behind the shooter . With handguns and low velocity rounds it 's hard to see because of it 's not pronounced . It still occurs though . I am in the military and work in logistics . Before weapons and rounds are approved they study variance at different distances . Certain weapons are designed for the round to strike at the same point at x distance and y distance , the variance between the two affects how the ammo or the weapon is categorized . For example ammo with a higher variance is categorized for training because it is less reliable . Lower variance and it 's categorized for operational use . If the variance becomes too high we categorize it `` Code H '' , it 's not allowed for any military use , and it 's either disposed of or sold to a commercial vendor . Standing perpendicular the off axis affect is really tough to see . https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=0hWJByUlbFY in this video there 's a couple times where you can see the off-axis `` squiggle '' ( best way I can describe it ) .

1 I also saw Watchmen and thought it was fantastic . I did decide to read the graphic novel and you can immediately see why the film was criticized . Bringing what makes the GN so special to the big screen is incredibly difficult , not to mention that he had to change the ending moderately . I thought the movie was well cast and directed effectively , conveying the overall message of the graphic novel well , but ultimately Snyder might have bit off more than he ( or anyone else for that matter ) could chew .

1 Yes , you did ! : )

1 Repeated changes mean that films which should now be legally free , based on the law at the time of release , are still copyrighted almost 100 years later . If the original law stood , Mickey Mouse would now be public property , and films made before to 1977 would be legally free to distribute or download . TL ; DR : They keep changing the law to stop things becoming free .

1 I 've seen it and I thought it was great .

1 Because the Vertigo part is very brief . The rest of the score is purely original , and makes up for 2 / 3 of the score . The problem with There Will be Blood was that the score was n't entirely fresh and had been used before .

As an Irishman , I can understand it clearly , but other nationalities of native speakers might get lost here and there .

1 Yeah , fuck O Brother , Fight Club , Foxcatcher , MI3 , Gilbert Grape , and Gone Girl .

1 I really dislike actors for voices as a gimmick but really , they 've always done it . Look at Disney 's Robin Hood as an example . I cringe at Iron Giant but 1 ) Vin Diesel pulls his part off really well . 2 ) The material transcends the Jennifer Anniston name billing .

1 That 's an urban legend and not true in the slightest ( well , the fact they were n't in the same place , I do n't know if they hate each other ) . The camera trickery your referring to is from the pan and scan tv version and yeah , it does look like trickery might be used . But watching Heat in the original letterbox former , you can tell clearly they are both there together . http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0113277 / faq # .2.1.2

1 That was beautiful . Especially the shot of Trump at the beginning .

1 First one kinda looked like one of those puffy stickers lol Good work , though !

1 `` I do n't think they like to be called fags now I think they prefer homos now . ''

1 I think I threw up in my mouth a bit after watching that .

1 Like , that 's my favorite name !

1 I have watched The Matrix at least 20 times .

1 Forgive me if you 're joking , but you can check the reviews , they 're quite real . The comparison is very April Foolsy , I mean the percentage of critics that had a posive review is such a narrow stat , using it to compare these films is pretty useless . All it says is that FF7 satisfied nearly all critics expectations , while there are slightly more critics who took issue with Interstellar . Nothing more , nothing less .

1 You spelled `` meth '' wrong

1 No she did n't . She just played an annoying weirdo with a power complex and irrational sexual desires . A great insane person would have at least some kind of crisis along that movies course . But i know , you think she 's sexy so you will defend her to death .

1 Director 's cut .

1 Thats correct , if you live long enough they will give you a government issue bionic body , or head jar depending on your attained level of wealth at the time . good luck .

1 I agree with everything you just said . But at least I could understand wtf was going on in Pearl Harbor , as terrible as it was .

1 Thanks for the fun fact

1 She has a very porny face . Good for her !

1 Fleet Activities Yokosuka , a US naval base south of Tokyo is where he made the appearance . He showed up because he lives in the area .

1 Is now malware

1 That 's pretty much what the commentary is like for every Carpenter / Russell film , and they are all great .

1 Versions ? Superman 1 and 2 were awesome ( especially for the time ) . 3 and 4 ? Well ... Returns was fine . Certainly not great , but hardly a 'shitty ' version . What else ? The cartoons ?

1 He never saw it . Just the trailer .

1 Mixed with flashbacks of when he shot that kid . Gripping stuff , man .

1 My favorite Coen brothers movie

1 Though why is the author calling this style of `` stupidity upon impending doom '' particularly French ? One word : Douglas Adams .

1 If you think this is a pro-war movie you have no idea of what this movie is about and what kind of writer Miyazaki is .

1 I think Nolan is starting to believe that himself . * cough * Interstellar * cough *

1 So many good points that never occurred to me are being posted . I 'm starting to feel a bit less smart than when I first posted this , haha

1 It was because just before that in the gym he bet Cpt America 10 bucks that the world was even stranger than he 'd all ready thought . Upon seeing the shield base he lost the bet , because it was the strangest thing he 'd seen .

1 Preezent

1 Go away ~~i'm~~ batin ' .

1 Yeah you are a goner

1 Two hours later . . . `` This script is nuts , junior ! ''

1 I tend to not get into casting because too often it just reverts to this guy looks exactly like the drawing . Perfect example is what goes on with comic book casting . The problem is not a lack of talent the problem is that there are so few roles written that are not intended for white male leads . So when you have a story like Akira with great roles for Asian actors who already get little exposure , it just makes it harder for them to break out .

1 Beer Wars - because its awesome http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1326194 /

1 it also symbolizes that beauty wins over brains in a race for leadership . you can have all the skills it takes to be the best leader ( piggie ) yet because someone is more attractive then him he looses out .

1 Well , there was that one scene in Superman Returns where he is flying through the city . He uses every one of his powers except flinging the symbol from his chest .

1 His next one is scheduled for 2014 .

1 Actually the flashback scenes in There 's Something About Mary were a lot more like my 80s HS than The Breakfast Club . Even Dazed and Confused was closer to reality , though it was the wrong decade .

1 I think OP probably wants to have sex with their girlfriend again at some point , so maybe they should skip * Antichrist * .

1 Was this picture taken from the Mars rover ?

1 * Really *

1 He even says that he 's there for a paycheck when he 's introduced which adds to the everyman character . His line after being asked if he believes in paranormal ( Janine asks something like , `` Do you believe in UFOs , astral projections , mental telepathy , ESP , clairvoyance ... '' ) is , `` If there 's a steady paycheck in it , I 'll believe anything you say . ''

1 DARK CRYSTAL EVEN HAS DARK IN THE FUCKING * NAME *

1 Requiem for a Dream , 21 Grams . Good luck .

1 Its Simon Pegg and Edgar Write not Nick Frost .

1 Oh come on , using an Altman film as an example is cheating . / s

1 Haha , maybe they were just saying that even though they were planning on him being there , he actually showed up ( which you never know with him ) .

1 I , too , felt bad for Cyclops .

1 Then again , they used like 90 % of his lines in the trailers .

1 BODY ! ! !

1 The main kid was fantastic , he 's got a bright future .

1 I agree . A few minutes , perfectly captured not just love , but life

1 It 's been a while , but from what I can remember , it felt long and dragged out . The story was n't very engaging , but the visuals were great . I do n't think it was a bad movie . To me , it just was n't good .

1 If they could get Jason Segel , I 'll buy two tickets . Twice . ... . ... . For a total of four tickets . That 's right . Four . Get writing .

1 Yeah . A few years ago I saw them at a dollar store that had all kinds of similar stuff , and I could not stop laughing at `` DOCTOR JACKSTRAW , THE ABNORMAL DRUG TRAFFICKER . ''

1 And here we were thinking you were some kind of informed professional or something .

1 What ? Geth and Quarians .

1 I actually thought the JGL would be a more traditional Batman , as in a detective type who uses his surrounding and brain to achieve his goals . Rather than the ninja Batman Nolan gave us . Not that I have a problem with it .

1 He 's still pretty damn big .

1 In the Hammer version , Peter Cushing 's Dr. Frankenstein is kind of a hero . Well , he is in the first one , kinda .

1 So he 's remaking Revenge of the Sith ?

1 robocop , terminator , predator ...

1 Short answer : yes . Long answer : yeeeeeesssssss . It 's based off of a manga which is long . Like Tolstoy long . Tolkien long . So the movie kinda goes it 's own way after a bit ( I 'm not sure as I never read the manga ) . It 's also not your usual anime , it 's definitely more mature , and less 'fantastical ' than most . The animation is still damn good despite it coming out in 1988 . Heartily recommend it .

1 Nope . Transformers is just bad .

1 Yeah . While the rest of the kids can hide their superpowers , he 's probably gon na have to be home-schooled .

1 Well , the best for me was `` Searching for Sugarman '' . You will not be disapointed . I promise ! ! ! ! Watch it right now .

1 Good for him .

1 I enjoy the hell out of the comics , and I was completely won over when one of the fights mirrored the opening of the original Ninja Gaiden . I 'm psyched for the movie , and I 'm suspending my jaded angry-nerd cynicism about comic to movie adaptations to make room for my inner-nerd-child .

1 Never thought of it that way . As a huge x-men fan , I tend to complain a lot about the movies but I do n't always think about the fact that they create a movie for eveyone to enjoy , not just the fans . What you said about Mystique makes a lot of sense

1 Scrubs season 9

1 Ho yeah !

1 I personally feel that this is bullshit . This is just making what that idiot did valid , just like all of the freaking media coverage . This is what he wanted . attention , and the fact that we are changing the way we live our lives is sad . This is what terrorism does . I know it is a cliche saying , but by doing this , the terrorist wins .

1 These days , watching one trailer will spoil everything .

1 The delivery man and package are the same , but I do n't feel that it 's a strong enough link . And saying that Simon ( and the other three members of the gang ) are n't real is simply too far fetched for me . It 's like saying `` It was all a dream . '' It trivializes the entire plot .

1 She really did n't have tween fans until she actually got the role , though . X-Men had n't been released yet , and she was pretty much only known for her Oscar nomination in Winter 's Bone at that point , a movie not exactly well-known to the tween demographic .

1 And yet here you are , down at the bottom . With the truest statement so far .

1 Ca n't have another Tommy show up or else the fans will expect him to return and then we would have to pay him more . Everyone do n't show emotion and do n't get into your character . You have one job ... ... sell toys

1 Two words : bitch please

1 I thought `` The Two Escobars '' was extremely well done , and better than many of the films I 've seen in theaters this year . Also liked `` The Best that Never Was . ''

1 Teared up .

1 It kicked ass

1 What was the sample size of statisticians ?

1 Ehh , I do n't love it . I 'm scared shirtless by women and children demons , but would certainly choke slam a woman if she were attacking , irl .

1 True , true . Remember the dummy episode ? God that one confused me for a really long time .

1 > those flying monkeys can go straight to hell . Oh they 're there alright ... waiting .

1 Just download it .

1 Your mom has n't either .

1 boons .

1 You do n't have a wife , kid .

1 12 Angry Men

1 my dad was all like `` aliens are probably super cool for them to hunt , but what is it saying about us ? ''

1 Shhhhh ! People do n't like it when you say stuff like that .

1 I knew he was going to be a great after his performance in The Wire . His transition to other roles after The Wire speaks to his talent too .

1 Has n't released in the US yet , that might contribute to the lack of attention .

1 I really enjoyed the first one . Looking forward to the next one

1 For what you 're specifically talking about , they 'll sometimes block off a small section of the stadium and film it while an actual game is happening . A fun little story about that is a man was proven innocent of murder because Curb Your Enthusiasm was shooting at a Dodgers game that he was at during the time of the crime and they caught him on camera , confirming his alibi .

1 Warner Bros. will absolutely beat it in court , if it even gets that far . There 's no way they are letting their movie be tarnished as something that `` incites violence '' and led directly to the shooting . The doctors and theatre I 'm not so sure about but I ca n't imagine anyone taking any shit from this guy . What an arse .

1 Okay , stay where you are and we 'll go score with the alien babes .

1 I sure hope so

1 Which is more intense , racism or xenophobia ?

1 Oh you 've seen it ? That 's * awesome * ! How 'd you score the `` advanced-advanced screening '' ?

1 : ( me too Well at least he died in a not-so-bad way . `` After cooking a late lasagne dinner for his assistants , Candy called his co-stars from his hotel , then went to sleep . After midnight , on March 4 , 1994 , Candy died from a heart attack . '' Seems like he was the nicest guy .

1 I saw the original Hobbit in HFR 3D and I enjoyed it more than regular 24 fps . I do n't think it 's a movie technique that should be in every film , but I do think it works well in the Hobbit because it 's going for a fantastical feel to it .

1 damn

1 fantastic list . especially excited to see where Cianfrance , Dominik , and Michod go in the future . shit , maybe all of them , actually .

1 In Contagion there is a scene where the doctor tells Matt Damon his wife has died He basically stands there in disbelief and asks `` can I speak to her ? '' as if his mind hadnt really processed the reality of it all and then he starts yelling at the doctor

1 We got an Iron Fist Netflix series that is coming up . Who can deny 13 hours of Iron Fist .

1 Yes that does make it okay because obviously people want to see good looking people in big blockbuster movies . If you think for a single second that the main reason for casting good looking people is n't about making the most money possible , then you 're just flat out wrong .

1 * Heeeyooooo *

1 The 4k blu-ray spec allows up to 100Mbps , double what current Blu-rays can do , so obviously no streaming service will compare to 4k blu-ray when it comes out . Until then people 's options for 4k are expensive players that download a very limited lineup of content or Netflix 's 15Mbps 4k streams . Edit : Why would anyone downvote this ? It 's perfectly accurate .

1 I hated it the first time i watched `` Phantom Menace '' in theaters , that did n't stop me from going two more times though .

1 Boo , I remember rewinding and rewatching this part at least 3 times with my family . Have n't done that in years .

1 I 'm kind of indifferent to his later scenes but his intro monologue is absolutely priceless . `` Chickchaw territory . ''

1 Damn , I hope I 'm that classy when I 'm that old .

1 Yeahhh , I realize that now , it was really weird though because I was reading the comments on that in another tab , came here and saw it , and immediately assumed the worst : /

1 Most people hate the occupy movement .

1 Given the three dimensionality of final work , it 's unlikely they 'll use sand or oiled sand to cast the pieces . An investiture ( think high temperature reinforced plaster ) will be cast around each piece individually and then those will be baked until the wax melts out . Then they 'll be inverted and hot bronze poured in while they 're still hot . After the filled investitures are cooled the plaster will be broken away releasing the cast bronze to be cleaned and finished .

1 Oh so wonderful ! Warms my heart .

1 This is likely the most quotable movie ever made . Almost every line is a classic .

1 Thanks for posting . I believe this film is about actor ( s ) , and so they need scenes showing how famous the fictional characters inside the film supposedly are .

1 Women of hollywood - age at your peril ...

1 How ? The Pirates movies do gangbusters at the Box Office . 2 of them made over a Billion , and a third almost made that much .

1 Three Colours Trilogy , The Dollars Trilogy .

1 That was almost 10 years ago too .

1 If so that sticks with Godzilla 's traditional role . Would be sweet . The 2nd trailer has the vaults with big doors ... so it could be that the mutos easily come from there .

1 Bro i ca n't feel ma fuckin legs . I got ta go to hoss p'tall . Make monkey drive

1 W ... .Why would you refuse to ever see the LotR trilogy ?

1 I know . If that was in then Kong Vs T-Rexes were in and the floodgates open .

1 Hollywood is built on a 1987 Sylvester Stalone film ?

1 Did you see Olympus Has Fallen ? It 's White House Down but good .

1 `` takes itself far too seriously for the talent on display . '' is a pretty major piece of it , for me .

1 So ? That 's not necessarily a bad thing .

1 Magnetoman

1 [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` Guess they did n't pick the right artifact . I wonder what it was . Some of them are more clear than others , but they might not all even have been defined and shown in the film . '' )

1 mean girls is great if you 've never seen it . its like heathers but not as badass .

1 After Uncle Rico hits Napoleon in the face with a steak and Kip says , `` That 's what I 'm talking about . ''

1 decades of being The Joker *

1 The first three films in the Jack Ryan series - * The Hunt for Red October * ( w / Alec Baldwin as Ryan ) , * Patriot Games * , and * Clear and Present Danger * ( both w / Harrison Ford as Ryan ) - are all very good .

1 A raccoon firing a futuristic assault rifle ? I will see this film

1 Tron : Legacy . The 7.1 DTS-MA track is reference quality , it sounds absolutely incredible . PQ is very good as well but the audio overshadows it .

1 Welcome to the internet , now , would you kindly give me your credit card details ? You can trust me , as I am very polite . Enjoy your stay .

1 My brother did that to the scene from Brave with the grizzly bears .

1 No , it 's a real movie . It 's released in Canada on 22 August ... ..

1 Revenge movies are always overrated . I thought Gladiator was great but mostly for the action sequences . For me , it has just enough story to drag the somewhat silly characters along to the end . Too much speechifying but it is pretty enjoyable .

1 Think of him more like an angel in terms of power / celestial hierarchy . Otherworldly being but not as powerful as the demigods or the creator of everything running around .

1 I would say this is true for the entire trilogy- if it 's on TV , I 'll watch it without hesitation .

1 man and wife or lover get into car accident , his face get disfigured and the lover dies . the man decides to live in the dream world where he can make up anything he wants . ( we do n't find out that he was living in the dream world till the end ) .

1 OH MAN , I forgot about that movie . Yes , I guess I have to put an asterisk next to my previous statement . I loved that movie ! I think what made it bearable for me was that it was very light on graphic horror . Like , if you take a scene like the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail , there 's a LOT of blood there . But it 's played for laughs so the tension is low . That 's what Tucker and Dale did very well . Some pretty grizzly stuff happens but the pacing , camera work , etc . all worked together so that a horror wimp such as myself could enjoy it . BIG HEADS UP : If someone is reading this and decides to check it out , * do not watch any previews * . They will absolutely ruin the movie for you . By all means read reviews , check it out on Rotten Tomatoes , etc . But do n't watch the trailers .

1 I 'm not a big fan of his movies , but I watched every single Rob Zombie commentary . He 's so informative and you can tell he has genuine love for his projects and that he 's a huge fan of all cinema .

1 He aint gettin it like he used to .

1 Drink your drink , go home , jerk off and that 's all you 're gon na do .

1 I would go that he does n't get overshadowed by Simmons . His performance of being fragile really elevated Simmons ' dominance . They were both equally brilliant and on different sides of emotions . What a fantastic movie this was .

1 : (

1 What is it they say ? Luck is when opportunity and preparation meet ? I think that 's it . Having a website , knowing how to quickly put up additional pages , being active on Twitter , having a portfolio ( the publisher loved my sketches , but wanted to be sure I could do `` finished art '' before talking about a book ) all that stuff helped .

1 I liked Red . It was n't stunning or anything , but I was entertained .

1 A mature adult creates acceptable boundaries between your parents and yourself if they are too controlling . Instead he ran into the wilds and committed suicide by way to total lack of preparation . Edit : also he shot a moose with a 22 which is totally un-ethical . With his lack of rifle discipline he was likely to terribly wound it and have it die a horrible painful death .

1 Yeah , and the thing is RoboCop should n't be able to jump . Like , at all .

1 Cool . I 'm happy to see they got him in there , and I do hope he has a bigger part . Also , I hope like hell the new director works out . The last couple have been so damn good it 's hard to imagine anyone creating the same atmosphere at Lin

1 u_f0kin_wot_m8 edit : hahaha

1 Along with Laputa .

1 uhhh ... yes please

1 Never really thought about it , but `` Bachelorette '' sounds like a Bond song .

1 Well , we got [ this ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ulcPQya3z7o ) out of it .

1 No he did not

1 ... .I kind of like Cube 2 : Hypercube .

1 Cauterizing a wound does n't close it . It seals off blood vessels to keep them from bleeding . So he would be able to open up the chest and stomach cavity with the light saber but it just would n't bleed as much according to movies .

1 Do n't want them ? Then post about stuff you do want to see : )

1 Not really . But when the group collectively only talks about 10 things ... then it makes it easy to appear like everything 's a circlejerk . Tldr- your definition of `` everything '' is skewed .

1 Elsa is in Norway : )

1 Me too . I mean , I did n't Google it , but I remember being confused when I first saw the trailer , wondering if it was the book adaptation or something else . It seemed so unfamiliar , seeing as they seemed to 've taken some very obvious liberties .

1 And Val only had to buy one ticket to fly in an airplane .

1 I 'm thinking it 'll start 2 hours before the end of Raid 2 and then go back into Rama 's story , but we 'll have to see .

1 I also watched this . Al Pacino did a good job ; really made you feel for him by the end of the movie and how much of a loser gangster he was which was a nice change from him being the boss like in The Godfather and Scarface .

1 I think as a joke , they should release a trailer with a ton of Jar Jar Binks in the trailer an he 's a Jedi master .

1 So it 's simultaneously so boring that you ca n't even watch the entire movie and amazing at the same time ? I was 9 when I saw TPM and thought it was amazing too then I watched it again as an adult and thought it was terrible . That does n't mean it taints my memories of light saber battles with friends .

1 vince vaugn very good prson i meet him two hers ago at birthday pastry he very nice

1 Alphas were extremely rare .

1 He did an amazing job in that movie .

1 no because i can watch it at home and also i hate people at theaters

1 * life is like a thread of George Lucas comments on reddit *

1 Thank you ! These threads are always just reddit circle jerk opinions anyways .

1 This . I hate how every movie brought up for discussion on r / movies must be either underrated or overrated .

1 > the end of Death Proof

1 He did ruin Green Lantern though .

1 It also depends on the projectionist . Some just do n't care about getting it right , they just want to get their paycheck and get out . I know , I was a projectionist ant a drive in theater , still have a hard time going to walk in movies because the focusing never seems to be done quite right .

1 ( I have not seen TDKR ) As long as Nolan is involved I would hold an interest in watching it .

1 That 's a horrible list , full of sexist generalizations .

1 Disney wants you to bring your iPad to the theater .

1 The 'televised assassination of a media personality ' could only mean Network but I had no clue who it was . Imdb reveals Tim Robbins was an uncredited assassin . Interesting .

1 I thought it was a serviceable film , it was competent and did its job . Did it wow me ? No . There was nothing spectacular about it .

1 Probably the movie I have rewatched the most . I do n't do drugs or drink much .

1 Yeah , it obviously was n't as good as the books , but I did n't think it did anything offensively wrong , and it made me happy to see a beautiful visual representation of battle school .

1 So , so , so terrible .

1 Very hard .

1 Yes . We did a survey of everyone . You 're the single person in the whole world who was against it .

1 It 's a dystopian film . The whole point is to portray a future than is uncertain thus making the ending even more poignant .

1 This is r / movies so it 's not a twist .

1 Love that ending and movie

1 Phase 1 : Buy a $ 15,000 camera stabilizer to make your movie with . Phase 2 : Add an assload of artificial camera-shake in post . Phase 3 : Profit ! ! !

1 That ... is less than two weeks .

1 Will Smith has n't bombed an action movie in more than a decade . Hit after Hit after Hit . And even with meh reviews , its still a very broad appeal movie that will sell overseas .

1 um

1 In the novel , he is emotionally and socially isolated . When he does make a connection , they change the situation . Alone was probably the wrong choice of word ...

1 `` Shit . Shit . Shit . '' -David S. Goyer

1 Because I ca n't fathom why someone would set out to make something intentionally awful . Is it a `` haha joke 's on you guys , I made it shit on purpose '' type situation ? Because that 's far worse than attempting to make something enjoyable and failing .

1 Quick someone call Turk and JD !

1 * Cocks BB Gun . * * Serious Face . *

1 I was so disappointed that they did n't do more in the GoF film with the Quidditch World Cup match . I remember reading the book for the first time and thinking , `` I ca n't wait to see how they portray this in the films . '' I know it was n't really integral plot material , and the special effects would have been very costly and time-consuming , but I really think it would have been stunning if done correctly .

1 It 's an abbreviation of the title , `` The Lego Movie . ''

1 If all reference and imagery of LEGO were removed , I highly doubt we 'd be fawning over it . However , that is n't the case and I 'll gladly let nostalgia override my cynicism this one time .

1 The wanted scene made me laugh . Other than that ... Fuck that movie .

1 It has a laughable 0 % on RT .

1 It was just ok . I certainly did n't hate it , but I wo n't be seeing it again .

1 Directors getting actors they worked with and liked for other movies is nothing new .

1 Sure did . Made me angry .

1 > Well of course it 's his opinion . The reason I corrected his comment in that way was because he said it in a way where he thought in his mind that his opinion was more correct than other peoples . I wanted him to realize that there were a lot of people who did find it funny since he was voicing his opinion in a douchey way * in my opinion * . FTFY

1 Yeah , people seem to forget it 's about 2 guys , going to work everyday and doing their job .

1 I 'm happy that he 's a bit more lax in the extended Age of Ultron trailer , i.e. when he just casually picks up Mjolnir , flips it and catches and gets a little quip out . He 's not quite so rigid it seems , as he kind of felt in the original Thor .

1 You definitely , definitely should be crazy excited : ]

1 That 's not so much angry as full on berserk mode . Titus is a fucking blood bath .

1 I 'm sorry I 'm late . I was attending the reading of a will . I had to stay until the very end when I found out that I received nothing . Broke my arm .

1 I would n't be surprised if that 's how they did their 17 minute scene in a single cut .

1 It 's an alright movie . There 's some cheese though .

1 Well no different than most people I go to work to pad my paycheck . The difference is instead of clocking in out I and other sales professionals MUST sell to make $ . And quality reps will ask many questions to their prospect to find a need that our product or service can fill .

1 You are seriously missing out on a lot of great movies .

1 Really * answer .

1 Why ca n't Corey have hair . He looks so glorious with those dark locks .

1 Just re-watched Waking Life . What a great movie to both focus on , or have going on in the background of your day .

1 why were you looking up anal beads ...

1 Glad because the movie was amazing !

1 My theater was only half full , but there was very little laughter throughout the entire movie . Of course there were laughs after the `` black jewish boyfriend '' line , but otherwise , it was pretty cringey . But I do n't even remember much comedy throughout the movie . They played it quite straight for lengths . Like , the entire sequence where the kids are training to be Kingsmen , I 'm not sure if there was a single joke for 30 minutes . So yeah ... it was kinda weird to throw in at the end ... '' Can I get a kiss ? '' `` I 'll do more than a kiss ! '' Hah ... random sex implication joke near the end of the movie , low-brow but whatever . And then she just hollers out , `` we can do it in the asshole ? '' And everybody is just sitting there like , `` yeah , we got the joke , now it 's dumb '' .

1 At least it has zero spoilers .

1 Lucky you , on both computer and 360 , I get prompts everytime I am on the browse page . And its not just FB , when I click away , it will ask me one more time to share and then lists all the major social networking sites .

1 I like Gwyneth Paltrow .

1 Personally A Bug 's Life is one of my favourite of Pixar 's , next to The Incredibles and Finding Nemo . And Toy Story . And Toy Story 2 . Dammit , they 're all good . : & lt ;

1 Quarantine was alright . They were basically carbon copies and every single shot was the same . Remember to watch Rec 2 . Rec 3 turned me off a little as it went full blown religious .

1 Just because it will be moved practically does n't mean it will look good moved practically . I 'm sure there will be some computer magic used to smooth out movements on the practical creatures . How much is up in the air but the fact that none of these pictures are filled with green screens and tennis balls is extremely relieving .

1 I 'm just excited to get December 21st out of the way , because I 'm fucking tired of the multiple 'do n't forget the world ending ! ' comments every fucking time somebody mentions 2012 .

1 I read many articles about the OBL mission including the New Yorker piece and none of that took anything away from ZDT . I thought it was more compelling than Skyfall , Django and all the summer blockbusters with exception of Looper .

1 Over half of an entire demographic is `` really low '' ? That would be about 160 million people currently in the US who have read the book . Only 126 million people voted in the 2012 Presidential election , only ~96 million US adults have a college degree , Michael Jackson 's `` Thriller '' ( the best selling record of all time ) has only sold 110 million copies since 1984 , 108 million people watched the Superbowl last year , Final Fantasy VII has sold 10 million copies worldwide , Ocarina of Time has only sold 7.6 million copies worldwide . I 'm not sure you understand how rare it is for something to have that kind of exposure .

1 Very true . The first time I saw Gone Girl , even though it was suspenseful and engaging , I felt a disconnection with the characters and what was happening onscreen . By the end of the movie you really get to know them and their darkest secrets , and it makes every other viewing somewhat more ominous . It 's like an impending sense of doom , but all you can do is sit back and watch .

1 Whoa whoa whoa . He may be a talentless shitbag .

1 Segal crossed with a younger michael douglas .

1 Worth the watch , I love anything Thomas Lennon is involved with and it 's actually pretty funny .

1 Your loss then .

1 This is the kind of movie where the lead is on the poster 4 times .

1 Good . It 's just relabeled Twilight fanfic anyway , and I vastly prefer him as Jax .

1 Glad I 'm not the only one who 's thought that .

1 Thanks . : D It took a long time to make , so I 'm happy somebody likes it . :3

1 There 's always got to be a Meryl gif . Someone got ta deliever .

1 Oscar season yall .

1 How is he NOT nominated !

1 I 'm pretty sure he meant plot errors .

1 Mike : Why 'd they get rid of the fighting ? It was the best part of the old version . Sue : I think kids were hittin ' each other or somethin ' , man . Trent : Yeah but you know what , Mike ? You can make their heads bleed in this one . Mike : Make somebody 's head bleed . Sue : No man , we 're in the playoffs .

1 Derpzilla !

1 Yeah . Fuck the mods . I for one love seeing the redundant articles that keep getting posted to this sub on a daily basis . keep em coming .

1 Wait for the unrated bluray , I believe they filmed most , if not all of the original ending ( reason for the inflated production times / cost )

1 Facking ahtabahts

1 I think they show it in the Appendices of the EE of The Two Towers . Watch them if you have n't , they 're phenomenal and well worth the hours of your time . The multiple commentaries are excellent as well .

1 You really should see the fourth one . I personally think he did a fantastic acting job , as with all the actors / actresses .

1 Prisoners .

1 He will always be this scurvy character to me .

1 > Guys like me

1 inception- definitely . that shit was brutal .

1 Let 's lower that humor to 65 % . ( great gif by the way )

1 * Sleepover

1 Which was ?

1 Could be , could be .

1 The Animatrix had 2 times the thought of the original film .

1 this is probably my favorite Hitchcock movie .

1 I would n't say unwatchable . I 've found it to still be really enjoyable after seeing it the first time .

1 That 's a fear response .

1 Agreed . I think its funny when people talk about how deep and meaningful pixar movies are then jump on Cars for being `` childish '' or `` bad '' when clearly they didnt get the deeper messages in the film . Maybe Cars hides the message better than the other films and thats why people cant see it and there for dont like it .

1 Looks like a Reliant Robin . They drove one on Top Gear . Think flips over at the drop of a hat ... for obvious reasons .

1 About 30 years ago we invented these things called VCR . They were pretty rad . They could record shows for you to watch later . Nowadays we have these things called DVR . They 're pretty similar . Aside from that , most of the cable companies have these things called websites that you can watch shows on , at any time . They call that On Demand service . Sometimes shows are actually free just by going to the site , without even having an account . The show is being shown on ABC . That 's a antenna channel .

1 I liked his idea for the Chronicle sequel . Sad we wo n't see it . He does come across as a prick , though .

1 I believe it 's his upcoming movie 47 Ronin .

1 yeah , I was underwhelmed by it .

1 Wow , What the hell happened to Iron Man

1 I would recommend The Fourth Kind

1 Babadook , dook , DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKKK ! ! ! ! ! !

1 Awesome , great mix .

1 Here 's one little hidden trivia that makes the movie that much better for me ... > The slow , gloomy , blaring trombones in the main theme of the film score are actually based on an extremely slowed down version of the fast , high pitched trumpets in the beginning of the ? dith Piaf song `` Non , je ne regrette rien , '' which is used as a plot device in the film . > Furthermore , when music is heard by someone who is currently within a dream , the music is perceived as slowed down . Thus , the main theme of the film score is almost exactly what the beginning of `` Non , je ne regrette rien '' would sound like to a dreamer . > This thematic device is brought to its logical conclusion when the song plays at the end of the credits , signaling that the audience is about to 'wake up ' from the film .

1 My theory has always been that the movie would have had a lot easier time being good if it had been rated R . The lengths it goes through to avoid showing actual violence or actual sexuality takes a lot away from the movie . If they had just gone completely balls-to-the-wall with the concept and made the movie darker , sexier , and more violent I think it would have turned out a lot better .

1 For some reason , I laughed hysterically at this comment . I 'm not even high .

1 I knew if I kept reading far enough , I 'd find similarly confused Redditors . I was still rationalising it until the scenes just spelled out a * completely * different direction .

1 I think the problem with Akira is it cuts SO much out from the mangas .

1 What a joker .

1 Though there might be actors better for the part , I can see Tom Cruise fitting into the film just fine ... as long as they do n't make him look like an action star in it ( which Del Toro wo n't ) . A little bit of weight and some good make up to make him look a little older than he is and he will be fine , because whether you like it or not , Tom Cruise is a half decent actor .

1 This poor guy on the escalator in Total Recall being used as a shield http : / youtu.be / np6NZ-EB2lY ? t=2m1s

1 Definitely was the best introduction to just exactly who we were fucking dealing with . The `` oh '' was a bit unexpected and incited a full blown `` ohhhh shit '' from me . Awesome fun action flick . I loved it !

1 One of the best crime movies out there . Check it out .

1 I 'm with you . It was a beautiful movie , but the story was just okay .

1 It was a good movie for the time as it had a descent story , acting , soundtrack . I think that Brandon Lee dying during production may have hyped it a bit but it was a good movie . Was it the best movie of the 90 's ? No , it was n't but it was good .

1 http : / i.imgur.com / c8PdQ.gif

1 Chrono Trigger .

1 The James Franco one is creepy

1 I agree , that thought also crossed my mind , though it * might * be justified if it 's used to fly out cast members to screenings , like Brent said in the video .

1 That 's a horrible suggestion , but it would be fucking hilarious

1 I like `` I want more life , fucker '' because Batty , after appealing and bargaining with Tyrell as his God , not getting what he wants and now desperate ... changes tactics and approaches Tyrell as a puny human who he can easily kill with his fingers out of anguish . The `` I want more life , father '' line is just bland and obvious . The religious undertones were already there and this just makes it heavy handed and plays to the cheap seats .

1 It was more because in the early episodes , Toby would constantly act as the voice of reason for Michael 's schemes whereas the rest of the Office just took it .

1 ... catch .

1 Throw Captain America in there . That 's what V is hiding behind the mask : a red skull

1 Honestly , if they do n't kill themselves over Batman , it 's going to be over something else .

1 He was the best thing about that microwaved menstruation .

1 Toy Story 3 .

1 His Christmas morning Scrooge is amazing . An upvote for you , good sir and not a farthing less .

1 But then he might be too close to Batman . I agree with the tone though . Some darker themes in Spiderman would work really well . When Doc Ock said `` I 'll rip the flesh from her bones '' I thought `` Fuck yeah ! That 's what a bad guy is supposed to say ! '' [ Now dig on this ] ( http : / imgur.com / HSOhe.gif ) * Edit : Darker themes in SPIDERMAN *

1 I disagree , it make her look more sober .

1 dude if a girl cared that much about a movie reference I would be impressed regardless

1 And even Spielberg himself .

1 Straight in the middle of a * The Road * reference .

1 exactly . you ca n't blame hollywood for making crappy sequels if they fill theaters with em . only way to fight crappy movies : DONT SEE THEM . never cave . be that obnoxious guy who refuses to go with idiots to see an idiotic movie . be the movie snob that you actually are , instead of paying $ 12 to see The Hangover 2

1 Double the fooling !

1 This I will agree on . Duel of the Fates is damn awesome .

1 I think this is the first time I 've laughed out loud at an upvote gif . And I ca n't even explain why .

1 Really ? The WORST movie to EVER be nominated for best picture was The Hurt Locker ?

1 If it is as good as the Prestige , I will be over the moon .

1 Seriously ? Drastically changed ? I think that 's going a bit far . Do I like the chnages ? No but the films are still fucking awesome and are still basically the same .

1 Your friend is right ; I loved the movie Forrest Gump , but the book ... the book just really sucked . It is supposed to be a comedy , but Forrest just never comes across in a sympathetic way at all . And the scenes that I assume are intended as `` funny '' did n't strike me that way . It 's one of my 2 usual examples for `` movies that are better than the book they came from '' ( The other being * Who Framed Roger Rabbit * . )

1 `` I 'm your huckleberry . ''

1 Both characters may be lying in the sand , but they are definitely not at the same beach lol . I can see some parallels between them , but the tones between the two might be complete opposites . IMO both are amazing .

1 well the cameras only held ten minutes of film at one time so he had no choice .

1 The Heartbreak Kid was pretty funny .

1 You 're at +1 . That means you at most got like two downvotes . Stop complaining about downvotes . It 's pointless and is only going to garner you more downvotes .

1 The Thin Red line .

1 You mean Escape From Tomorrow ?

1 That song was awesome but go figure a bunch of virgins dont like it . Limp Bizkit is an easy punching bag , but they were popular for a reason : they made hits . They 'll forever get my love after their collaboration with Method Man

1 she didnt know her sister was the wicked one in the beginning

1 You 're saying you believe that there 's some woman out there more attractive than Emma Watson ? Are you a guy or a girl ? I 've rarely heard this opinion from a guy . The few guys i 've known who do n't think Emma is attractive are the kinds of guys who really like huge tits .

1 It 's like a hundred kind-of-cool beginnings . I could not sit through the whole thing . When you prepare something like that -- tell a story , do n't keep starting different stories ... unless that was the assignment ? I liked what I saw but I feel like somehow I missed something .

1 License and redditstration sir . Did you know you were commenting `` whoa '' ? Please step out of the internet sir and place your hands on the desk .

1 A buff Franco could pull Gambit off amazingly . He can do the Southern accent already and he has the charm . Damn , that could be pretty sweet .

1 Kilmer 's turn in * Tombstone * is my all-time favorite performance by an actor .

1 That 's a bit of an extreme comparison .

1 That list sucks big time . To put * T3 * over the original * Terminator * is blasphemy if I 've ever seen any . Also , other films are n't remarkable at all and should n't make an Arnie top 10 list , like * Eraser * . Now , in truth * Commando * is a ridiculous pile , but I 'm willing to admit it 's classic . A movie missing : * Conan * .

1 I rewatched that a few months ago with friends after having not seen it since it was in theaters , and my god it was beyond abysmal .

1 Pretty much any action movie made before 2000 .

1 Yes , Audition was a great movie . But as far as brutal horror I find Tcm far more satisfying . Speaking of tcm ... ..Rob Zombie was a thief he stole just about every concept from tcm to make house of 1,000 corpses . Weak . I have no respect for anything he 's done .

1 Eh , he did the second Well thing because the other highborne were suffering too . He could have just chilled and leeched off his vial forever , but the new Well saved the rest .

1 I really like this movie . Some would say that it 's too slow in its pace , but I found it just perfect .

1 Maybe he thinks he 's in a movie

1 Honestly the whole x men timeline is so fucked up that Brian Singer was probably just like 'fuck it he 's gon na have metal claws '

1 Man , I love The Warriors .

1 Bob Barker was one of the greatest cameos ever . Same with the football personalities in The Longest Yard ? they could act .

1 I do n't know . He was n't really in it long enough to give an awesome performance . I mean , the little amount he did have was top notch but I do n't think it was enough for a nomination .

1 I even turned and asked my friend if we were watching the same movie

1 You do n't have to be such a dick and talk down to people . Like , ok ?

1 For a solid stretch there , he was one of my favorite actors . Especially in the sci-fi realm , which he 's not associated with as much . I love Die Hard & Pulp Fiction , but man ... within a year of each other he cranked out 12 Monkeys & Fifth Element . Then he kinda did a half-step between sci-fi and tough guy with Unbreakable , and * then * he did Sin City . The guy was in a lot of great movies that he 's not necessarily remembered by .

1 They probably used Zbrush . It 's around $ 1000-1200 if memory serves ( which in industry terms is actually not bad ) . It 's pretty much the standard for both `` quick '' concept sculpts and more polished final sculpts that you see in the movie . You could model it in a program like Max or Maya , but for organic creatures nothing beats the natural sculpting feel and speed of Zbrush . And as jojojoy says , these guys are VERY talented . Just because you have the same tool , does n't mean you 're going to get that dragon .

1 It 's cheap enough to contribute to Marvel . Torrenting everything is a douchey move . If you like something support it .

1 Back in 2002 , South Park aired an episode where the plot was about how Lucas and Spielberg were making all sorts of alterations to their films such as replacing weapons with walkie-talkies , and the word `` Wookiee '' was changed to `` hair challenged animal '' to be more politically correct . I had thought it was all just a ridiculous joke by South Park . Now it turns out it was n't . Luckily , Spielberg regrets altering E.T. , but it remains to be be seen if Lucas feels the same way .

1 Tarantino already said that he couldnt be happier with his critique , and he does not care what others think about the movie .

1 When it was realised that if you got him laid he would n't have such a negative attitude and be on the side of evil . Much like anybody , I suppose .

1 40 days and 40 nights

1 What 's your point ? It 's a science fiction movie , and the first two movies had it . Who gives a crap if they give away your position ? `` Screw Star Wars , the lightsabers are so bright , and they hum , why do n't they use real swords instead ? '' Yeesh .

1 did I see it with you ? the whole time I was just waiting for all the fucking talking to end and for * something to happen * - except for some of the middle , when I was asleep ...

1 I think of it like comparing a lightbulb to a laser . If that thing is powerful enough to evaporate water a hundred meters away through rock and presumably metal it should be powerful enough to at least penetrate human skin .

1 Justice League : But Only The Important Members .

1 Normally , I 'd agree with you , but not on this one . It 's like this ... There 's a giant pie being baked . It has over one billion slices ( dollars , if you did n't get the analogy ) . Two stars of the movies ( Thor being the huge one that has his own movies and was the single biggest star of the Avengers as per the plot ) are getting 500,000 slices each . This means just 0.05 % of the total pie per . RDJ as Iron Man earned between 50 and 80 million slices , or 5-8 % of the total pie . Now , when you have two actors making a fraction of what one actor is , this is normally okay , unless one of those actors making the fraction of RDJ is one of the MAIN CHARACTERS . You can argue that Scarlet Johansson is n't a major character , which is why I 'm understanding that they did n't pay her much , but Chris Hemsworth has a couple stand alone movies to his name now , and the entire plot of the Avengers movie was that aliens came from his universe ( they certainly are n't from Earth , where every other Avenger is from ) . You may see this as millionaires complaining , but this is more about making sure things are fair . Why should the studio get all of the profit that Chris Hemsworth and Scarlet Johansson worked to bring in ? Should n't they get to share in the pie ?

1 It 's far from a great movie , but it has the benefit of starring Rowan .

1 So it was n't just me who thought that sentence was misleading .

1 Literally shit .

1 I miss Jason Segels writing : (

1 you hated silver linings playbook did n't ya

1 One , no question imo

1 It 's not important to understand what happened in the last part of the movie in order to enjoy it . The film starred very believable struggling entrepreneurs , who stumbled on something they could not understand . They made conjectures , tried to control it , and ended up way too deep . It was a very real portrayal of what could happen to ordinary people who stumbled on time travel , and the way everything falls apart at the end illustrates this perfectly . One of my favorite scenes : The main characters are on their way to the time machines , and feel in complete control of the situation , when all of a sudden someone 's father appears , has apparently done time travel and they literally have no idea how or why . The confusion that ensues and their attempts to make sense of it was brilliant . It 's never explained why the father appears . Maybe the main characters never find out . But the answer is n't important , just the messiness of the situation .

1 Watchmen was n't underbooked . At the time of its release it set the record for the number of theaters playing an R-rated movie . The real issue is that it 's a heady , complicated three-hour adaptation of a beloved fanboy comic book . It grossed a quarter of its total earnings on the first day and more than half its earnings in the first weekend , when the Watchmen fans came out of the woodwork . Remember , this is early 2009 - people were expecting another Dark Knight and got Rorschach cleaving a dog 's head open , one character nearly raping another in the first 30 minutes and 20 minutes of blue Manhattan dong . It just was n't meant to be a mainstream comic book movie . It still holds up for what it is , but do n't blame the theaters ( who took a bath on it after opening weekend ) . ( I was dumb enough to take a girl on a date to see it . It was a disaster . )

1 Tom : Story and character have to work !

1 Ann Hathaway . Shes my future ex wife

1 `` Listen , something 's come up , and I 'm not just talking about my cock . ''

1 Wow that actually looks great either way .

1 He was a pretty bad-ass Blonde bastard . https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=-PRJnLBva3w

1 And he is right . Miniatures looked much better then this hyper-real CGI . It looks so unnaturally smooth that it just does n't feel right . With the exception of Smaug , he looks amazing .

1 I agree that a person 's movie taste will mature with time . But There are movies that does n't follow basic horror flick formula and still scare and entertain people .

1 I 'm not saying it 's good , by any means . But really , if you walked into T4 and thought that it would be a groundbreaking sci-fi movie , that 's on you . Even from the ads , it looked like it would be the same consistency of turd as the last two movies . Transformers has been a dead franchise for years . The Last Airbender , on the other hand , was a beloved children 's cartoon , and everyone hoped that would carry over to the movie .

1 * They have a cave troll . *

1 saw this movie last week its amazing .

1 And your answer is valid !

1 Here 's your GIF ! http : / i.imgur.com / 4Dk66Lr.gif _____ ^ ( Hey I 'm JiffyBot , I make GIFs out of YouTube links . Find out more ) [ ^here . ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/JiffyBot / comments / 1fvyi5 / rjiffybot_information_directory / )

1 Oh man , you 're right . My brain actually completely erased the memory of that scene . I think they tried to really convey how obnoxious our imagination sometimes is , but they got really carried away , if I ever catch myself daydreaming about being a 3-foot 100 year old baby , I 'm checking myself into a mental health clinic .

1 So underrated .

1 He was good but let 's not get crazy

1 [ It 's the most common superpower . ] ( http : / tvtropes.org / pmwiki / pmwiki.php / Main / MostCommonSuperPower )

1 Nah , just TDK itself . And that 's only due to Ledgers outstanding performance . People still talk about that movie , even though a good sum of the people who was TDKR have probably never even thought of it since it was released last year . To put it objectively , TDK > Avengers , Avengers > TDKR .

1 How many pages did you find before Slenderman got you ?

1 Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side , kid .

1 Saruman and Galadriel were at the White Council which occurs in the middle of the Hobbit . That 's where Gandalf disappears to .

1 Do n't change your argument , my three year old brother is more entertained by Sesame street than the Simpsons , does n't necessarily mean that Sesame Street is better than the Simpson .

1 Madam , and thank you : ) Up until this point , I was having a wonderful time hanging out with all of you and talking about the Golden Globes . I do n't know what I did to piss people off , but it 's Reddit , I guess .

1 I 'm sure his reaction will be Aladeen

1 They may have a superficially similar setting but that 's just about the end of their similarities .

1 So you 're complaining that someone pointed out that this casting call is racist , not complaining that someone is accusing it of racism . Well , I guess that gives you the moral highground ?

1 Depends on the horror - if it 's a really good film , perhaps alone , but if you 're watching something for a laugh and a bit of fun , and the film probably is n't that staggering ( like the Paranormal Activity movies ) , then it 's infinitely better with people . Half the enjoyment is laughing at your friends jumping at the scary bits .

1 That 's a pretty original joke .

1 That 's okay buddy . Your valiance has earned you my upvote . Ocean 's Eleven is a great movie .

1 I would also like to see that .

1 They should call it the fantastic fail , because that 's exactly what it 's going to be . I hope it 's so spectacularly bad that fox gives up and finally loses the rights for all time .

1 Tangled was orignally called Rapunzel Unbraided and then Rapunzel . Disney wanted to tone down the princess asscoisation in advertising to get boys to want to see the film and to emphasize that Rapunzel was n't the only main character .

1 Go read .

1 Always did like Starscream in Armada .

1 They were looking for directors who were not huge names but had a passion for story in film . Raimi was probably chosen because they felt his previous films has a strong reliance on good story and themes of the story / genre , as well as Raimi being a huge fan of comics / cartoons His movies are often cheesy , almost as if an homage to cheesy movies of 50s-60s , and that fits perfectly with one ( of many ) adaptations of Spider-Man

1 It 's a camrip , everything looks pale green .

1 You are watching a movie about a crashing airplane while being on an airplane ? Not bad ?

1 Tatum was my favorite part of 22 . I did n't think it was anywhere near as funny as the first though .

1 This is brilliant .

1 Well shit man there were two or more villains in that movie . I thought it was about MC Hammer at first but that dude does n't make jazz music so I did n't know what the fuck the reference was about .

1 wrong , both are , they both used the phone . Get it together .

1 He probably watches rom-coms .

1 Yeah really . Pretty much the best kinda of typecasting there is .

1 I was about to say the same thing . As far as I 'm concerned , both of their careers went to shit after the 80s .

1 It 's young adult fiction for the wonder kid crowd -- whimsical , exuberant , and nauseatingly naive .

1 Yeah , the marketing campaigns for Nolan 's Batman series have been very good . Plus , they wrapped shooting a few months ago , so it is n't being transported to another shoot location .

1 They 're not implying anything outside of the realms of the film .

1 Exactly - there are basically two gods fighting each other , and people complain that there was too much destruction ? Seriously ? What the hell did they expect ?

1 I use to be a good editor . I stopped caring when final cut stopped

1 I 'm okay with it so that it builds more hype and fills the seats !

1 Ooh what a hip iconoclast you are

1 Then stay out of the thread that 's full of spoilers !

1 ~~What ? ~~ Never mind , I just found the new score system on Playitforward , I did n't realize that they count each game in a Bundle , that 's why the '6 ' confused me . If it interests you , I now use Steamgifts.com and already gifted a game there and plan on doing a PiF for Amnesia come Halloween ( [ Case in point ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / vQ4JR.png ) )

1 It 's not just the editing . I remember thinking how awful a lot of the production design , and shot composition was during Dance of Reality ( think Dog Show ) . And I just think he 's going for a very specific and strange kind of shiftiness , at least that 's what I took from it . I did n't really have a problem with the editing or directing in DOR ( that final pull out shot was incredible ) , but I would n't really call any of those side technical details great .

1 That 's still 34 bucks , partner .

1 quit raging you asshole

1 Jewel Staite is something else . So is Morena Baccarin

1 The Abyss Titanic

1 / shudder

1 To be fair it 's just a response to people nitpicking a plot in a movie where it 's really not that important I like to imagine a redditor on movies reading threads and see 's someone nitpicking and goes `` yes ! ! pedantry ! my time to shine ! ''

1 There is n't a whole lot to `` get . '' Evil wins out in the end .

1 Well technically he did n't direct Nightmare , he just came up with the characters and wrote it and produced it , but none the less you make a very valid point .

1 I want to see Natalie Portman dressed in her exact same wardrobe from Leon .

1 And also with the prisoners

1 I appreciate that . I hope you think it 's okay at least !

1 How awesome did the [ Paramount ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=otPyEsObI1M ) lead in used to be ?

1 His son is in Russia , he went to visit his son , shit goes down .

1 It 's Cowboys & Aliens . Are you in the US ? Not sure if it was reversed internationally but I doubt it . You are wrong .

1 My first thought was , `` this will be 10 minutes of Tom Cruise clips '' .

1 IF a 3rd was ever made again . I hope Digital Domain would get to do the fx again . They 've gone through some rough times since making Ender 's Game , but they did such a good job on the 2nd one that they deserve to get 3rd .

1 The book ending is even more incomplete .

1 Holy shit ... my life is complete . Can I put this on a CV ?

1 Pretty sure there was in The Idiots too , not first scene though .

1 I knew that I 've seen the gesture before ! I 'm a big TZ fan , should have remembered . Thanks !

1 Calling something satire does n't automatically excuse it from being called shit .

1 Yoko Ono ?

1 Well the first day of New York Comic Con is October 11 ... Who knows

1 Latest one is awesome and was a good return to the franchise 's roots . Really hope there 's a sequel .

1 Pretty much this + Good Will Hunting .

1 but that leap of faith was just to continue living out his weird , fetishized artist fantasy through them . it really was n't as selfless as he wanted everyone to believe . if he had n't done that , he 'd just have to go back to the `` normal life '' he loathed so much .

1 I 'm okay with this

1 so ... u just love sequels then lol

1 It 's definitely not Enemy at the Gates !

1 Let her have all the things .

1 Probably still not even close to Bill Gates .

1 I thought it had no more nor less substance than Drive . Just communicated in a different way . I liked both movies .

1 to capitalize further on the humor , realize that his remains were blasted from a canon .

1 too far

1 PUT IT ON NAO ! ! !

1 Yeah , go figure . This week , of all things , somebody mentioned the character Enzo Matrix from the 1990s TV show Reboot . Just last weekend I was at an anime convention ? cosplaying Enzo Matrix from Reboot .

1 We are all now several IQ points lower for having read that .

1 Because pre internet , thats why

1 The same actress playing a prostitute and being helpless in one way or another .

1 YES ! ! ! Only has made a few movies , but each one has been great .

1 He also wrote the screenplay for the unmade Halo film , which I hear was very good .

1 Yea , its real deep man .

1 Watchmen uses it , too .

1 I find Jaden quite annoying in interviews , especially the recent spate of interviews with him and Will .

1 > It 's a Hollywood remake of a Spanish take on an idea David Lynch did twenty times better years before . I 'm curious , what Lynch film are you talking about ?

1 Just watched it last night and yeah I sort of agree . I heard a lot of hype about it and was a little underwhelmed . It did n't really resonate with me in any way . Just sort of `` oh ok , now i 've seen it '' . I thought the performances were pretty good , there was just not enough substance to back up the style it was clearly going for . The music was great though , loved the throwback combo of the music and some of 80 's editing and cinematography . Just something missing I guess .

1 He is usually the one off camera hitting Bruce Campbell with branches and other such things . They good friends so I dont think its a problem . He 's also the one that hits Tobey Maguire on the head with a bag in Spider-Man .

1 My heroes .

1 John Powell 's score for How to Train Your Dragon is phenomenal , I could n't be more pleased that it was recognized .

1 I did n't even bother to read any of the comment beyond that . Instant upvote .

1 Then you 're blind as it has been reposted a billion times in every subreddit including this one . There 's at least 3 postings in this sub 's new queue right now . How about you check before submitting ?

1 Thanks , will do ! I did n't even know that existed : )

1 Actually I really enjoyed the 3rd boom while I always struggle with the 2nd . The 4th book on it 's own is amazing but I 'm always annoyed at how much it delays the greater story .

1 1.21 Jiggawatts ? ( I consider one and twenty one to be their own separate numbers )

1 SPOILER ( i think ? )

1 It is .

1 Please tell us more about the facts you know .

1 Pretty messed up flick . Definitely stuck to the sides of my brain for a few days after watching . It 's highly beautiful and highly disturbing .

1 Joker set out to prove that he is just ahead of the curve . That anyone will turn out like him when the chips are down . Dent went mad , but the whole thing with the boats disproved the Joker . So ... the actual truth of the matter is inconclusive at best . The Jokers plan failed , because he did not set out to tarnish the Batman .

1 The book is amazing . Go for it .

1 Of course they will need you to move out while checking out your interior . And then they will clear out the interior for you .

1 So * you 're * sayin ' that Streep 's character was kinda Prada her ...

1 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me , you little bitch ? I ? ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the top school of anger & profanity , and I 've been involved in numerous secret raids on Mr. Rogers , and I have over 300 confirmed curses on twitter . I am trained in slurs and I ? m the top swearer in the entire country . You are nothing to me but just another Will Smith . I will judge your opinions with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth , mark my fucking words . You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet ? Think again , fucker . As we speak I am contacting my secret network of hitmen across Fucking , Austria , and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm , maggot . The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life . You ? re fucking dead , kid . I can be anywhere , anytime , and I can outswear you in over seven hundred ways , and that ? s just with my bare hands . Not only am I extensively trained in classic curses such as `` damn '' , but I have access to the entire arsenal of nonsensical curses and I will use them to their full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the earth , you little shit . If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ? clever ? comment was about to bring down upon you , maybe you would have held your fucking tongue . But you could n't , you did n't , and now you ? re paying the price , you goddamn idiot . I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it . You ? re fucking dead , kiddo .

1 Sliding down your throat ?

1 That was more opinion than anything . 1 . The consensus has been that the human eye sees the equivalent of 60FPS , not 40 2 . The slow frame rates are n't the suspension of belief ( if that were true than theme park rides would be rather boring . ) The reason it looks weird is because everything we see now is half that . We are n't used to it since we 've been stuck at 24fps for a century .

1 block to block . nice touch .

1 Lies . Halloween 3 is awesome ! Tom Atkins is a superhero who 's only weakness is suspension of disbelief !

1 She 's a product of All That . Oh the '90s . : )

1 Here 's your coat .

1 Jonah gave the note to the Feds .

1 Marvel wants full control on their movies . Sony would be difficult to work with .

1 I suppose if you do n't consider getting justice for people who were sexually exploited as children a worth cause , then I can see how it would sound that way to you .

1 They mention clearly that Labor Day was limited released in the last week of 2013 , showing that they obviously were going for a limited release for oscar contention ( implying they thought they were Oscar bate )

1 My guilty pleasure

1 holy shit

1 that RomCom with Captain Kirk ... ..

1 Haha seriously no one read OPs post at all . Go back.. Read it again .

1 True to the character .

1 I mean giant robot dinosaurs ... I am going to be entertained no matter what .

1 holy shit , I did n't know those actually existed . I always thought they were were just the movies mock version of Converse . I really need to get a pair of these now .

1 It can be confusing , as a lot of times , the film 's distributor is not necessarily the studio that funded / produced the film . Buena Vista is owned / operated by Disney , so might as well be the same thing .

1 Well he 's in the new Star Wars . That should help .

1 ( A wild source appeared since your comment )

1 Yeah , when I saw the first trailer I thought Ninja and Yolandi were barely in it , but now this last trailer makes it look like they 're almost in it as much as Chappie ! ? I 'm excited either way .

1 Jealousy .

1 He did . All the cast really sang

1 OH MY GOD !

1 Came here to say this . Streep 's performance was not bad by any means , but Viola Davis ' performance was just too good . Also , I think I may be suffering from a bit of Streep-fatigue , but that may just be me .

1 To be fair , his character was Irish in the book .

1 They put so much effort into the design of the `` background '' jaegers and did n't really use them much . Then they sort of just ended up being cannon fodder .

1 Also applies to Alice in Wonderland .

1 I thought the same , was n't there a scene where he cuts himself a hole in the floor ? There was so much potential for non-fight lightsaber stuff .

1 well it 's not purposefully hilarious , but manages to be for how ridiculously over the top it is . I suppose it 's worth a watch for the overall WTF-ness exhibited in it ( though I 'm pissed that the Baroness did n't have the cool accent )

1 He was the bomb , yo .

1 Great speech ... I really enjoy this illustrated version : https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=LCsvJe3dGVk

1 Agree with the second point - His female characters are like a male fantasy and as far away from reality as possible . Buffy shows strength by lifting 200lbs or something . They are about super hero strength and one liners not much depth . Then again most of his characters are . Tropes / One liners . But his work is more or less for fun . So it is okay as long as he is not considered some savior for women in movies .

1 Peyote force ghost !

1 Dude that was me too ! ! ! My parents always say that I * was * Luke Skywalker when I was 4 . Gimmie that lightsaber and away I went .

1 That was totally ridiculous

1 I do n't think it is a factor or weakness . It is more like someone who spent their whole life eating real cheese , and then one day someone gave them a Kraft Single and called it cheese . Yeah , it does things cheese does , but you can tell the difference as soon as you put it in your mouth .

1 Film editor here . As far as keeping everything in from the book goes , it 's simply impossible . As a general rule of thumb , 1 page = 1 min screen time . Now this is a script page , not a novel page . A script page usually contains half or less of the information in a novel page . So a 500 page novel is not going to all make it into a movie . But more importantly , novels can weave a story in an entirely different manner than can be translated to the screen . I do n't understand how even laymen can not grasp this . What works as a written word does not usually translate to fit cinematic formulas . Authors of novels are at much greater liberty to digress from the action for example , whereas you do that in a two-hour film for half an hour , your audience will be saying wtf very quickly . You can not fit an entire novel into a movie or even three movies without losing something , even if it is at least for artistic or functional purposes . * This is why movies are made from screenplays and not novels . *

1 Neither of those are contrasting , you just named songs you like from movies .

1 These leaked photos are terrible for films . It 's easy to call a photo like this shit when it 's taken by some turd with a potato camera . The only lens that matters is the one shooting the film .

1 So many laurels even trees look at that poster and say 'Damn girl , lose som a dem branches ! '

1 I agree . I used to watch it all the time on Comedy Central and there was usually only one or two good skits and those were condensed versions of the show .

1 This is my favorite movie of all time . Whenever I feel down about my life I watch this and remember that things are what you make of them .

1 I do n't think Ford and Oldman wanted people to know they were in it

1 The cake scene in Lady Vengeance is n't about pretending nothing happened it 's meant to be about the fact that for the parents can now starting living normally again and are starting to get over get over there children 's deaths . At least this is what I think I have n't seen the movie for a few months so correct me if I 'm wrong but I 'm pretty sure this is what Chan-wook Park was going for in this scene .

1 ..brethren ?

1 This is pretty awesome . Good for them !

1 Also , Terminator ( the second one ) .

1 I was really disappointed he was n't the actual guy , so much so I can only think it had to be a fake-out . He 's too perfect not to play that character .

1 DC The New Frontier , which is * awesome *

1 I went to a premiere with a Q & A opportunity where I learned some interesting things about the film . The actors went into the first day of shooting without a script or any specific knowledge of what would happen in the film . The dialogue and actions of the characters were improvised and driven loosely by notes describing the motivations of the characters and things that they should be talking about . The film was shot in sequence so the actors explored the characters and plot in a state of confusion that parallels the position of the viewer . I thought the experiment was a success and produced a really nice mood for a thriller movie .

1 It 's funny how you can win Best Picture without being nominated for Best Director .

1 No thats called The Raid

1 Never

1 Yes . We win , but it 's shown as a bleak , empty victory , and the question you 're left with at the end of the movie is , was it worth it ? Was catching bin Laden worth ten years of compromised morals , giving up our ideals , and becoming paranoid obsessives like the main character ?

1 Ann : I think it 's gon na rain . Graham : It is raining . Ann : Yeah .

1 Shit , you 're right . This just turned serious !

1 Robocop .

1 I would watch that show but it would probably emphasize the fact of how little sex I 'm getting and make me want to cry .

1 Episode I one for me , maybe its a nostalgia thing ...

1 I think she had been gone for some time at that point .

1 ... to sound almost like Bane again .

1 Walked down there at lunch time . It was so eerie , people just standing around looking at a bench . No one was talking or doing anything . Just standing .

1 If your computer / console is capable of running the game at 60+ fps , turn that s # & t off , is what I always say . If the game runs at lower than 60fps , having motion blur might help it not look as choppy , but enabling it actually lowers FPS due to needing more processing power to perform ...

1 yeah , i never meant to deny that . the joke i was trying to make from the beginning was something along the lines of `` the flash could never lose , because of x / y extreme events , '' like no matter what they made Quicksilver it would n't be possible kind of thing . i agree about your last two sentences too , i look forward to seeing him on screen .

1 Honestly , there were some really great parts in ROTS , but once someone starts talking the quality goes way down ...

1 My personal favorite part was when they said they were capturing humans to discover their `` weaknesses '' Oh so besides slashing , stabbing , biting , blowing up an entire field of cattle was n't working well enough ?

1 [ http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=a_fwz62LoP8 ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=a_fwz62LoP8 )

1 The movie with James Spader and Maggie Gylenhall `` The Secretary '' is just a better `` R '' rated movie of the `` GREY '' ... ..way better and more visuals ...

1 It was kinda * supposed * to be anti-climatic..

1 He had a valid point . Putting him in stasis would have prevented the embryo from hatching . I do n't see how that was funny .

1 It 's Mothra

1 Comicon footage that everyone has seen ...

1 They 're in purgatory .

1 The goal here is to bring more people to watch Star Wars , not Avengers or Ant Man . So Avengers is the best choice since a lot of people will see it , people who should be interested in Star Wars .

1 No , but I like that this one is . See also : http : / io9.com / 5931046 / why-remakes-are-one-of-our-greatest-achievements-as-a-civilization

1 `` Innocent until proven guilty '' is a legal principle , not a moral one . I 'm not suggesting those accused of sexual assault should not get a trial . But outside of a court , in deciding what we believe , all we can do is make the best decision we can given the information , because we do n't have the luxury of a professional investigation , sworn testimony and police evidence . And given how rare false accusations are , the fact that she made these allegations as a child and maintains their truth today , I am very much inclined to believe her .

1 ive completely forgot about how fucking awesome minority report was . going to watch it now , thanks

1 * chicken burrito *

1 quiet , all seeing , all observing

1 I agree . You can look at ParaNorman 's opening weekend compared to Brave and Madagascar 3 for an example of what happens to a animated feature that 's not mass-appeal . ParaNorman opening weekend : $ 14 mil Madagascar 3 opening weekend : $ 60 mil Brave opening weekend : $ 66 mil I thought ParaNorman had a fantastic story , was really entertaining , and was gorgeous too look at . Easily able to compete with Brave . So why 'd it do so bad opening weekend ? Probably because some older audiences assumed animated = family / children 's movie and some parents assumed zombies = too scary for children . It 'll be interesting to see if Laika makes a profit from ParaNorman ( box office mojo does n't have the info for it 's production costs ) .

1 Produced by Ben Folds too .

1 They handled the Pinbacker thing with too heavy a hand . The rest of the movie was excellent . If they 'd not taken a right turn into horror movie territory , it would have worked much better .

1 Theaters around me had a showing almost every * minute * and all were selling out , I had to check three theaters before I finally found tickets for an 8:30 that was n't sold out and sold out minutes after getting my tickets

1 I 've never heard of a dining theater or taking dmt to watch a film . What a weird story . Enjoyable though

1 I wish all directors would put as much thought into their stories as he does . I recently re-watched Primer and although it is very obviously a low budget film and Carruth 's costar is n't a great actor , the story is great . Shane Carruth is someone who , in my opinion , understands cinema . He understands that it is a special place where anything can happen , so he makes movies where the impossible is a reality . But he also understands that the audience must have a connection to the film , so he uses those incredible circumstances to tell a relevant story that can apply to everyone .

1 > props to Nolan . Heh . Props .

1 Maybe that the adult and children were more-or-less 'forced ' together , the adults started out hating the kids , but in the end loved the kids .

1 I 'm pretty sure GDT is planning a sequel , they did n't destroy the whole alien planet , I 'm assuming . Those aliens would be mighty pissed , I think they can find another way to earth if they can genetically engineer those kaiju .

1 I geeked as soon as I heard that . I 've been waiting for that to be put into a trailer for years .

1 Yes , as the article mentions , Howard the Duck and Superman IV both of which bombed .

1 The guy has been shit on the entire movie , and he finally aquires the means to just beat the fuck out of everyone . I found it very satisfying , in a primal way .

1 you can see the speech in his outter breast coat pocket the entire time

1 AND THE OTHER ONE TOO

1 Do n't forget he 's also MFCEO of K-Swiss . http : / m.youtube.com / index ? desktop_uri= % 2F & gl=US # / watch ? v=XI_9Yxr0blo

1 They probably did n't want to alter the only working Tiger in the world . But , I agree . It should have been camoed .

1 * Ahem * I think SolarAquarion meant to say * TETSUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO *

1 Your comment just now made me realize that pit was Nolan 's version of the Lazarus Pit . * WHOOSH *

1 yeah ?

1 And I 'm wet ... damnit .

1 If you think being a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle is about being discrete and not noticeable , than you 've seen less of the tv show than Michael Bay ( at least , according to the billions of comments Redditors make ) .

1 Clearly , he understood it -- and addressed the reasons that he thinks it fails . If you can defend Oblivion 's `` originality , '' why not do so instead of getting pissy ?

1 I honestly only know the plot of `` Taming of the Shrew '' due to this movie . I ended up seeing an interpretive dance version of Taming of the Shrew ( not knowing that before I went ) and would catch myself saying `` Ok , what was happening in 10 Things I Hate About You at this point ? ''

1 Well in Tijuana , they paint their donkeys to looks like zebras .

1 Pardon ? what is wrong with rape and murder ?

1 A few more for good measure : * Office Space * Waking Life Saving Private Ryan ( Always have to sit and watch the whole thing when it 's on tnt ) Spirited Away SLC Punk Dumb & Dumber Harold & Kumar Grandma 's Boy Friday

1 I 've seen people rate and write reviews on movies they have n't seen using only their speculations .

1 `` As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster . ''

1 I heard he wrote the entire 3rd edition .

1 This is n't really `` leaked '' , it 's an official release from the studio . Marvel releases too many clips in my opinion , weird that they 're already doing so for Ant-Man . Honestly , this looks pretty good . Camera work seems a little bland and less visually stunning than what Edgar Wright would have done , but the pacing in this scene is really sharp . Corey Stoll delivered a lame line really well . I like the tone . I could see Rudd becoming Marvel 's next RDJ if the rest of Ant-Man is like this . Cool beans .

1 I can see Catch me if you can , Wolf and the Gatsby , but i get very different vibes from Django .

1 Agreed . Everything this guy acts in ( minus Even Stevens ) is cancer .

1 `` Realism '' or `` Plot Holes '' .

1 lol

1 Also `` You Know My Name '' by Chris Cornell from Casino Royale . After that opening and song I was sold that the movie was going to be awesome .

1 So you 're saying you do n't want to see [ JW spoilers ] ( # s `` the old park ruins , wild raptors and Pratt 's raptors , I-Rex wrecking havoc , and what will happen to it , motherfucking REXY ? '' )

1 I really wanted to like it . But I agree with most critics . `` Even at nearly three hours long , this ponderous , talky and emotionally distant biopic fails to illuminate Alexander 's life . '' http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Alexander_ ( film ) # Criticism_by_film_critics

1 It obeys the laws of physics as laid down in the comic universe . It 'd be magic to * us * but not to someone like Emil Hamilton . And the laws of physics and the rules of biology that apply in the DC universe would have a muscly Kryptonian stronger than a skinny one ; before things like Kryptonite or solar over-exposure are taken into account . Edit : To further clarify , Wonder Woman 's strength is Magic . Superman 's is biology .

1 You mean those old stone troll computer generated images ?

1 Teenagers in basements ca n't create Richard Parker or the Hulk .

1 I think that he 'll play a small role in Guardians of the Galaxy then he 'll be the main villain in Avengers 3

1 It was John Hurt in Snowpiercer , not Ian McKellen .

1 I demand the goat be sacrificed if you win

1 Well , The Dark Phoenix saga is effectively ruined thanks to Brett Ratner .

1 Depends on who is writing him .

1 Brave

1 He got about halfway , but not out of Ontario .

1 They way I see it is no movie will ever be perfect , so if no movie can get 10 / 10 then it may as well be the `` out of 9 '' scale . Which is silly of course , so why not just make it `` out of ten '' and rate an appropriate amount as 10 . In fact I 've just decided from now on my personal rating scale goes up to 11 as I have lots that I consider 10s . So 11 is the perfect movie

1 Yeah , if he was n't 16 at the time .

1 Drive was a compelling film . We find fascinating characters that are in touch with their own power . Also , it builds an empathic connection when a character is really good at whatever they do .

1 Personally , I feel that American Hustle was more of a poor man 's Goodfellas .

1 The amount of 'Internet Sensations ' in newsreports which are infact just youtube vids with 10,000 views and 60 % dislikes .

1 He only killed Zod . Zod 's army is in the Phantom Zone .

1 It 's about two fugitives kidnapping a family and forcing them to sneak them across the border . That 's all you need to know .

1 It 's more likely than you think

1 I think she 's supposed to be some sort of clairvoyant and does n't wear one for whatever reason , maybe it fucks with her powers .

1 Unstoppable , The Taking of Pelham 123 , Deja Vu , Man on Fire , Crimson Tide That 's all 5 if I 'm right .

1 They were n't prepared in Jurassic Park and it served the mix of wonder and fear , see ?

1 The music , the scenery , the acting . A perfect first date scene .

1 You shut your mouth

1 MONSTERS 2 : STRAIGHT THUGGIN ' tagline : Got these monster ; they mean muggin .

1 In the Extremis case only the underlayer is stored in his bones , no armor or weapons just the connections . The actual armor still has to go on which he admittedly does by thinking . ( Using his ability to interface with technology to use vectored repulsor flight to move the pieces in place ) In Bleeding Edge the whole armor is some sort of nano-bio-tech deal and all of it is stored in his bones . It 's more of a hard fluid with no actual armor parts .

1 I 'd die either way so probably The Hunger Games so I could live like a king before I go .

1 Yeah I know its really unimportant in the movie , but Im still interested in what it could have been

1 Does n't Drive also open with a long take ?

1 He 's got a little treat for ya all right ...

1 That 's Vibranium . An asteroid of it hit in Wakanda .

1 Agreed . It brings a nostalgic tear to my eye . They do n't make them like that any more .

1 Memento ?

1 The last samurai was not a character in the film , much less the one played by Tom Cruise . The plural of samurai is samurai . The title refers to the group of samurai Cruise 's character lived with . They all die in the battle , they were the last samurai .

1 `` my '' Yeah whether or not you like it you 're a part of the circlejerk .

1 you and all your descendents are now cursed

1 Cathcart Towers Hotel ? Cathcart Towers Hotel ! Man that scene .

1 I recognize the situation , but for me it was Pirates of the Caribbean .

1 This is incredibly creepy .

1 My friend and I always quote * ' ... the word `` snapshot '' was originally a hunting term ... . ' * from one hour photo . we thought that character was Robin 's creepiest moment . and somehow , that was funny to us .

1 That dog-thing still creeps me every-time . Soooo creepy and organic . I hope they either do the best CGI I 've ever seen or try to keep some practical effects in the remake .

1 Confirmed . He even spelled it out for us .

1 I can see the formula , but after having read the book ... this guy 's life is amazing .

1 [ Obligatory ] ( http : / www.keanuisimmortal.com / )

1 It would need a really compelling script for the original cast to get involved . Morglurt Freeman wo n't just sign onto any trashy film .

1 ? ?

1 I highly recommend it . I thought its take on things was beautiful and made me feel like a kid again . The trailers did not do it justice , it made it look like an awful mesh but it really does work out nicely .

1 It does n't sound like much of this stuff really adds a whole bunch to the movie . My guess is that it was recognized as such and trimmed from the American version .

1 No man , I said `` hey Blinkin ''

1 Ah , OJ Simpson . What an actor . I wonder what he 's up to these days .

1 Redditor for 7 minutes .

1 YES

1 That depends on a lot of things , really ... some kids , some movies , it all depends . Think about horror movies and the difference between thrillers at PG-13 and horror at R . I guess it 's just complicated .

1 Holy crap , I just realized that .

1 And Joaquin Phoenix . And Robert Redford . And I 'm sure I 'm missing names .

1 The scene about the retarded kids ? I bet that was improv by Hill because you could see Leo about to just laugh his ass off towards the end of the scene . Amazing scene though .

1 Why ? They never hide the fact that he 's rich as fuck . Look at they way they shop around for pricey houses several times throughout the show .

1 It 's not a long movie , it 's only 98 minutes .

1 i was a kid and i couldnt sleep after that . some years later down the road theres a trailer for a new exorcist film ( i forget the name , sometime in the 2000 's ) and the commercial flashed that face quick . needless to say I ran out of the room as quickly as I could

1 Perfection

1 That movie was so close to being amazing . All the elements were there , just could n't make them fit together .

1 Based on a book written by Carl Sagan .

1 Thank you

1 Gregory . Fucking . Peck .

1 I hate that argument , that women go to movies with strong female characters ... No they go watch interesting movies that seemingly have strong lead characters , even when the roster of the Guardians is male dominated ( which is why I 'd like to see Mantis in the next film )

1 It 's linear unless you change stuff and you make a copy of yourself

1 1979 Capt America begs to differ .

1 AND SOME SKITTLES

1 Saved for future reading !

1 Probably was a friend of Howard Stark 's , tried to recruit him in the founding of SHIELD , probably did that for a while and then just gave it up around the 1980s or so . Saw what happened in NY and wish he could come out of retirement , but I 'm sure something bad happened to him that remind him of why he could n't .

1 * m'lady *

1 It 's possible to have both . People have done creative and imaginative things with public domain characters before . Zorro , the Greek and Norse gods , Robin Hood , Sherlock Holmes , Dracula , Lupin , Frankenstein 's Monster , Sleepy Hollow , Wizard of Oz , Hunchback of Notre Dame , Count of Monte Cristo , King Kong , Jekyll / Hyde , Cthulhu , etc , etc , etc . Franchises tend to be the same creative voices using the same characters within a singular continuity . It becomes stagnant . The way authors can still write original characters as tehy always have , but they also become more free to give a new spin on familiar characters we know and love . If I want to write a story with Sinbad is lost and stranded , later finding a jinn offering to help but who Sinbad suspects might be Satan , and Sinbad has to struggle to get back to his crew without accepting the jinn 's help or antagonizing him too much for fear of beingmurdered , I should be free to do so . ... That actually does n't sound half-bad .

1 I did n't know a single thing about the plot before I watched it and man am I glad . The film went in a totally different direction than I thought it would . It was a lot of fun . Would highly recommend .

1 I liked Grudge Match ...

1 Okay , my friend . It 's off to the next life for you . I guarantee you , you wo n't be lonely .

1 Peeta Parker

1 He was the perfect balance of tech , lady 's man , action , and gimmick .

1 To the cloud !

1 Top row , sixth from the right , for people who are wondering .

1 You may want to look at the movie Short Circuit . Johnny No.5 !

1 Any movie with a doorframe decapitation ... ish is a winner in my book .

1 Which is why I 'm worried about The Dark Knight Rises ...

1 Yes , Earth was doing poorly at the time of the discovery of mass effect tech .

1 Add to that shitting on Reddit 's rules by running articles that reveal people 's identities on Reddit despite their wishes .

1 Basically , that the aliens in Signs are no more a threat to earth than a mouse is a threat to your existence as a human being . The aliens are vermin that were unknowingly carried over when actual intelligent life visited earth .

1 Ironically in the books none of the characters display any emotion at all . Even though the entire book is narrated by Katniss ' mind she never once contemplates how shitty things have gotten for her . She just goes on to the next thing she has to do . EDIT : I should stop this whole `` Trusting autocomplete '' thing . Cat piss - > katniss .

1 The Truman Show , while technically it was a set .

1 You 've got a point there . I enjoyed Skyfall , a lot , I just think it 's unfair that it received such harsh criticism from some . It was a lot of fun and it looked absolutely amazing . Oh well , to each their own , I guess .

1 Out of curiosity , how old are you ?

1 2 years after age of ultron . Do n't worry

1 Not a fan of that idea .

1 It 's cause she is in everyone 's fantasy so if that counts as a movie than she is a DAMN good actor .

1 I feel like people who make this comment do n't have sisters . At least I hope they do n't .

1 hahaha not to be mean but how are you on r / movies ? ?

1 It goes for 2 and 1 / 2 hours . I really ca n't be arsed .

1 Probably the best example for OP 's criteria A

1 * Elephant * by Gus van Sant . It 's thematically related to Columbine , but fictional . And it 's quite brilliant , his best movie I would say .

1 > Jai Courtney of * A Good Day To Die Hard * fame That 's pushing it .

1 Thanks for reading my post completely before commenting . It makes you appear very well informed and like you 're contributing to the discussion .

1 Blair Witch , I believe .

1 interesting . I could see him getting inspired by the `` fear '' it created . using fear against those who prey on the fearful . batman begins was so solid .

1 Alright , fixed it up , my bad . Cocaine and THEN heroin .

1 I believe so . Also , the new * Conan * movie in development is going to be a direct sequel to the 1982 * Conan the Barbarian * film . It 's going to completely disregard * Conan the Destroyer * as well as the 2011 reboot starring Jason Mamoa .

1 Not Keanu Reeves please .

1 Have you seen perks of being a wallflower ? Logan was great in that movie ! ! !

1 I 'm old enough to get them and I thought it was a bit much .

1 An IT Manager from Ohio ca n't take it anymore . He begins killing those with mundane tech questions . Sounds like the plot to a comedy-horror to me .

1 And the asshole in front of you stands during the whole thing ... or the people stop dead in their tracks in the aisles for 5 minutes . Watching Lord of the Rings : Return of the King was probably the most excruciating example of that ... as it seemed to have a dozen `` endings '' each one feeling like `` the end '' . There were people sitting on the stairs , etc ... slowly realizing that there were 15-20 minutes of movie left to watch .

1 He was asked . I think he 's allowed to state is opinion on the issue when he 's asked .

1 Casablanca

1 [ 73 % ] ( http : / www.rottentomatoes.com / m / falling_down / ) , though . It 's actually one of Joel Schumacher 's better movies . A lot of people like it , some just are n't sure if it 's intentionally racist or how successful it is at being critical of D-Fens .

1 What 's funny is that Barbie did get a pretty prominent role in TS3 . Wonder what she had to do for that role ...

1 Jobs was a daughter hating super villain .

1 I like that name but it kind of does n't fit the actual film . I do n't know why but it sounds like a straight-to-DVD action film to me whereas this was supposed to be a major blockbuster . Edge of Tomorrow was also really generic , at least Live . Die . Repeat . is a sort of fitting name for the film even if it 's not great on its own .

1 shh

1 You have the Rockets ( they 're cool , right ? ) and ? a famous saying about having problems .

1 Reading `` Power Glove '' in the title and I instantly remembered The Wizard . That 's my favorite part of the whole movie `` It 's so bad . '' I 'm very happy they put it in this video .

1 Leo .

1 You cant blame a Shakespearian actor for comparing things to Shakespeare ...

1 i tried to enjoy it for what it was . still the worst movie i have seen in a while

1 What 's wrong with saving the day by sewing ?

1 I cried the first time I saw him dip that shoe : (

1 What an idiot .

1 > If you are making a submission about a specific movie or actor , please name them in your title ! ! That means no submissions with titles like `` This movie ! '' Submissions like this may be deleted .

1 Was n't comparing the two .

1 So you 're telling me Tobias STILL has n't gotten the rights yet ?

1 this is actually in my top 5 favorite movies , and no one ever understands ! It 's like they got inside my head and found out exactly what i think is hilarious and made a movie out of it . sidenote , the `` cool beans '' part is the only thing anyone remembers about it which is n't even close to the funniest part

1 Ron Rash is awesome . He represents the upstate SC / Appalachia so well . One Foot in Eden is one of my favorite books .

1 What did n't make sense ? The plot was relatively straight forward .

1 Yeah , that 's really an underrated film . After Hours is great , too .

1 I watched it on Netflix and forgot there was a US edit and was thrown off when the `` itchy trigga finga niggaz '' track was replaced .

1 Dane Deehan is going to be a powerhouse .

1 Who 's to say that the Joker did n't do anything ? Sure we never hear about it , but he could have given an important speech to the guests of the fundraiser . Or given his spiel on chaos and how it does n't favor one over the other , grabbed an automatic , and sprayed bullets into the crowd . I mean , when the girlfriend of the DA is thrown out a window , no one panics ; but if someone shoots into a crowd then everyone loses their minds ! Surely , if he has time to escape the tower before the cops show up , he also has time for other things before he jets . It 's just lame to be left with nothing more affirmative from the writers than , `` he just left i guess '' .

1 The body count is massive . Higher than Kick Ass I 'd wager . If you liked Kick Ass in any way shape or form , there 's no chance you wo n't like Kingsmen . The fights are very reminiscent of the Hit Girl fights , again , so much so that it really feels like a better Kick Ass sequel .

1 Firenze is doing yoga .

1 Cringeworthy is the new hilarious . Stop overreacting .

1 After the events of 70 's in DoFP .

1 Oh Joshua Lyman . Best Deputy Chief of Staff the White House never had .

1 They look off because you are used to the turtles having nice looking cute faces .

1 I was thinking the same thing . I mean , surely they could have found any old Mediterranean-looking pier for the last one ? I always assumed CGI would be more expensive and time-consuming than just transporting the actors and equipment to a real-life set .

1 I have to go return some tapes

1 I would n't call this a terrible movie . It was pretty well received

1 It 's harder at a regular cinema because you have to tilt your head and hold it that way the whole time , but laying down you just rest your head in a tilted position . Laying down is an improvement .

1 To pump you up !

1 Why does anyone do any job they are descent at but could take or leave ?

1 Picking * back * up ? How ? And * back * to where ?

1 * Great cast . * Great premise . * Based off a very good comic . * [ Somehow completely ignores the elephant in the room despite the fact that the comic was based completely around this comparison . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / 2PsGL19.jpg ) * Took itself too seriously .

1 * You know who . *

1 Although to be fair , both Gone Girl and Paper Moon have the same score on IMDb

1 If you put something off for a decade you lose the rights to cry foul on spoilers .

1 No .

1 Why ? It 's not like she would have fooled any of the locals into thinking she was one . She dressed with whatever made her comfortable , I guess .

1 Never heard of it so it does n't exist , sorry bro .

1 amazing movie

1 That really is some classic Pitt . Those hand movements .

1 Shutter Island was probably the easiest for me . It was just a really predictable plot . I knew as soon as the setting was introduced . And people I know really love that movie , never has made sense to me .

1 You cocky cock ! You 'll pay for your crimes against humanity !

1 Yeah , we know .

1 He 's old

1 I 'm going to have to agree with you on the whole Blade > The Crow . But you 're treading on dangerous ground . Many a 90s goth got their eyeliner cherry popped by The Crow .

1 I ca n't remember the last time I rooted so hard for someone to win at something . Such great characters IRL .

1 Prisoners was great . One of those movies I had to watch a 2nd time

1 Also the part where batman fucking kills people , and detonates a fucking bomb .

1 I think the first has a hell of a lot of work put into it , enough not to write it off like the other two . Though frankly , it 's just as thin , trading surface level visuals in place of actual heart and emotion .

1 Yeah , they went for the bad ass look . Good changes in my opinion !

1 I 'd certainly argue that it 's more fantasy than science fiction . But it 's not unusual for the genres to overlap . I think the goal of a work of fantasy is to provide `` escape , '' whereas the goal of science fiction is to either extrapolate into the future or use science and technology to analyze society and humanity at present . Fantasy has its head in the clouds ( away from Earth and in a galaxy far , far away ) while science fiction remains grounded and ultimately interested in this world . That being said , Star Trek is most certainly not pure science fiction . Few works are .

1 I see a profound connection between those two films . - JO

1 I 'm just gon na assume that every person who has ever watched Strange Wilderness and enjoyed it is not the kind of person to go online and write movie reviews . I enjoyed it , and I did n't write a review .

1 [ Bull Durham ] ( http : / youtu.be / DzX_K9pX3X0 ) ! Certainly not the `` greatest '' sports movie , but definitely my favorite .

1 [ Nooice ! ] ( http : / i.minus.com / ixCd9wDKPafka.gif )

1 Seriously , its the best thing pixar has done forever . Those toys are god damn massive money makers and that means more money for more movies . Sure its was a shit movie from an adult movie buffs perspective , but not from a childs .

1 I watched Killing Them Softly with low expectations . The intro was eh which made me think this was going to be a bad movie but then it built up to be this awesome film that I 'd watch over and over again because of the story . I walked out of the theater completely stunned at how Brad Pitt portrayed as a hitman . Nailed that role .

1 And the character was such a man that no one can be named Atticus now for the fear of not living up to him .

1 In the same boat , dude .

1 the . best . ever .

1 The Wire

1 `` Variety confirms that Johnson is on board to write and direct Episode VIII . ''

1 It 's an implied sex scene because they did n't show it . It ca n't be an actual sex scene because it 's not an actual scene .

1 it does n't matter

1 Yes . Yes it was .

1 You got me . I left the theater not interested in learning more about the guardians universe , characters , etc . Its not a bad movie by any means but I do n't understand all the praise it is getting .

1 t2 for sure .

1 Winnie the Pooh

1 What a crappy article , it does n't say a thing about what these new rules actually are . Just that film makers are affected .

1 If the movie is awesome , which it is , yes .

1 http : / i.imgur.com / YKBv6Ic.jpg I saw that at Venice Beach , LA . I didnt realize this was a huge tourist thing .

1 `` I 've been on /r/movies for over a year now . This is the first I am seeing of this . ''

1 I agree . I just thought , as others have pointed out , that it 's eerily similar how Jackson is making many of the same blunders Lucas and Co did with their prequel trilogy , and graphics is a part of that . Since we have better tech to make CGI more easily now than 10 years ago when the * Star Wars * prequels came out it is a more frequently made mistake to make everything comp-generated .

1 Amazing !

1 I work in 3D every day . I 've got a pretty decent understanding of whats cgi and whats not .

1 World War Z is a pretty decent movie if you take it by itself , though . Definitely not a `` going-down-in-flames , totally-panned-by-critics bomb '' as you imply .

1 This may be a bit of a lost cause but a pro-tip when watching the classic movies : -Remember the time when they were made and compare them to their contemporaries not to newer films . Chances are the newer films stole the shots and plot devices from the very film you are poo-pooing

1 > Natalie Portman I can never forgive you for this , Christopher Nolan .

1 Darjeeling is probably my second favorite of his films right behind The Life Aquatic .

1 I think this [ video ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=8b276bsDiQ0 ) just about sums it up .

1 I think OP was referencing the [ Zoolander meme ] ( http : / hotmeme.net / media / i / c / 4 / t2i-adviceanimals-lately.jpg ) .

1 Bradley Cooper is supposedly working on a screen adaptation .

1 John Noble had a sizable role as Denethor , the steward of Gondor in The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King ( and a small role in the special extended edition of The Two Towers ) . He is also Australian .

1 This are indeed

1 Mazes and Monsters !

1 I would say that is a fair criticism . I just did n't like all the product placement at the very end when the kid goes home . I thought it was even a bit much and I check my brain at the door of most movies .

1 I mean , this thread has over 100 comments right now . At least 25 different people commenting on this thread alone . Not everyone 's gon na agree on the same things .

1 Eh , I did n't mind him . Logan Lerman 's a pretty decent actor , and I found it kind of funny how he went from this moral , almost pacifist guy to `` fucking Nazis ! ''

1 Interesting , Drive improved for me on second viewing .

1 I mean , I definitely agree with the overall sentiment you 've expressed here -- there 's way too much in the way of GGI environments in the Hobbit movies , whereas the LOTR films felt tactile and tangible largely due to the extensive use of location shooting , * BUT * this might not be the best example to point that out , since \^this is * literally * the set used for `` The Hobbit '' films . During LOTR the Hobbiton set was built as a temporary filming location , but when they re-built it for The `` Hobbit '' movies they built the town as permanent structures , and it 's now a local attraction that tourists can visit . Overall though , yea , for sure .

1 Why is that ? Been a while since I 've seen it . I 'm also a big fan of 'escape from civilization ' films .

1 The article says she 's filmed `` The Last 5 Years '' AND `` Into the Woods . '' Both of which are ... .MUSICALS !

1 Skrillex . Barf . Although honestly I think perhaps they wo n't use Daft Punk . Tron : Uprising uses soundalikes of the Daft Punk soundtrack which work kind of well .

1 Howard Shore 's * Lord of the Rings * and * Hobbit * soundtracks .

1 I guess he 's a big gundam fan . There 's a video somewhere with him touring the museum in Japan and geeking out over the life size one . ( also , compare Coyote Tango to a guncannon . )

1 Mah Nigga .

1 A Scanner Darkly is incredible

1 This pretty much sums it up . Consumers are n't going to abandon Netflix and utilize a worse service , they 're going to keep Netflix and 'illegally ' download the shows unavailable to them . Not a fuck will be given , and rightly so . Maybe one day these companies will realize that taking advantage of new , convenient technology works a lot better than fighting against it tooth and nail . Also , I do n't think they realize that consumers take note of shit like this and are less inclined to support companies who are willing to fuck their audience over as a means to make more money .

1 Eh ... I liked Ex Machina better . I liked It Follows a lot though .

1 Yeah , he being a result of an earlier experiment would 've made it into another movie entirely . However , having another `` brother conflict '' could be the reason they did n't go that way .

1 Seeing the transition from a dark campfire with a small band of dwarves to a chaotic , mud splatterd Moria and then seeing Azog : * Whoa * .

1 No that 's Xanatos .

1 Chris Evans is surprisingly a very good actor , he just takes shit roles . Ever see Sunshine ? He was excellent in it .

1 Primal Fear is so fucking good . Ed Norton threw down in that movie and he was so young it 's insane .

1 About four paragraphs in I realized it was just fanboy rambling , which is totally fine . But when it 's passed off as journalism and it 's that lengthy it could n't keep my attention . Shit the same stuff is better said here and in /r/fantheories

1 Messa the original Sam , yousa bombad clone !

1 Black Widow had very little character development in her appearance in Iron Man 2 , most of the other characters had a built in pathos from their previous movie . Black Widow did n't so her pathos was written in to The Avengers itself . She was still stronger than most female characters on film .

1 I agree . I 'm surprised this sentiment is so far down . I 'm surprised most people find these things funny ...

1 Ever see Brothers Solomon ? Will Forte and Will Arnette are brothers trying to have a child . Hilarious . Will Forte should be in more things .

1 As others have said , PoA was a dramatic turn from the other books . There was actual peril afoot that had long-standing consequences and it introduced other pivotal characters like the Marauders . The arc became infinitely more complex with the time turner storyline and there was the first few tastes of real potential for death outside of the confines of the school , where the earlier two finales took place . It 's not my most favorite book now , having read the rest of them , but it was for a long time because it just was the moment where shit got real and Harry was n't a baby dealing with it anymore .

1 All humans are mammals , but not all mammals are humans .

1 ZING

1 Maybe he literally planned on visiting him next fall ?

1 I wanted someone to mention this . If I remember correctly from reading when it happened , Morgan was a stranded / abandoned wild calf that was taken in and nursed back to health . When it came time to release her , she was deem unfit / unlikely to survive on the wild due to being deaf ( again , if I 'm remembering correctly ) and possibly other medical problems . So , no one caught her with the intention of putting her in an aquarium , at first . I have n't watched the movie yet , so I make no claim at being 100 % correct , nor am I saying that they do n't address that themselves .

1 I met Wes Studi and I told him that I loved him in Mystery Men . He told me that it was one of the most fun movies to shoot and that Ben Stiller and the rest of the cast had him laughing his ass off the whole time .

1 She had the hispanic surgically removed after * Dark Angel *

1 Wait- he boned Tom Brady 's wife ?

1 Indeed , I agree , this is precisely the point that I was trying to make .

1 Now Adam Sandler just hogs all of them for himself .

1 `` I 'm presently walking down the stairs ''

1 Mystique hates mutant experimentation . She 'd NEVER allow that to happen .

1 A friend of mine told me a story about his grandad going to see Blazing Saddles . He was a hard working Irish Catholic who enjoyed westerns the odd weekend . friends mom and siblings told him about the new western out this week and that it 's supposed to be really authentic and well acclaimed , they really built it up as the next Good Bad and the Ugly , epic western . So Grandad walks down to the cinema , buys a ticket , and returns 45 mins later `` Jesus , that was the worst film I 've ever seen , shockin ' language and carryon , there was this black fella goofin around etc. '' . They asked him at which point he walked out , it was the part where they were all farting around the campfire with the beans that crossed his red line . Whenever I see that scene I always smile and picture my friends outraged grandfather storming out of a brownish old 70s lookin ' auditorium in absolute disgust .

1 For those who are interested , the song is [ These Days ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=J1N8GtDkYfQ ) by Nico .

1 Well the idea is that they are n't Thor , Iron Man , or Captain America . These are criminals who normally would n't give a damn . And of course ego is at play here .

1 > The KKK stand very strong politically on race relations , but that does n't mean they go out and hug every black guy on the streets . What the fuck are you saying ... ?

1 There we go now we 're not putting doctor who above star wars

1 It would be ice to see him .

1 He was great in Ai n't Them Bodies Saints .

1 I too am confused , but I do n't think many people have heard the HTTYD soundtrack , probably because they have n't seen the movie . Either way , it 's a crime that Powell 's work on HTTYD is n't more recognized . His score is half of what made HTTYD & HTTYD 2 such superb films .

1 But that movie is so crappy compared to the original series .

1 Ummm ... Thor 's Asgardian ...

1 I 'm going to pretend I 'm not crazy excited that someone asked for Greek film recommendations , and act normal ... .. Classics : `` Miss Director '' , `` Yellow Gloves '' , `` Crazy Crazy Family '' , `` Iparxei Kai Filotimo '' , `` Stella '' , `` Never on a Sunday '' , `` The Counterfeit Coin '' , `` Aunt From Chicago '' . ( I used to have run a website where people could watch all of them with English subtitles . I had subtitled them in six languages to spread the word ( while making absolutely no profit ) , but it was of course shut down due to copyright issues . I have no idea whether there 's the possibility of watching them now anywhere subtitled ... I check around every now and again , but with no luck . But have a look , I promise you they 're worth it ! ) Modern : `` Rembetiko '' , `` Loaf and Camouflage '' , `` Brides '' , `` A Touch of Spice '' , `` A Woman 's Way '' . ( You can find them with English subtitles ) . Theo Angelopoulos : ( He deserves a category of his own , as he 's the ultimate genius . Very slow and dreamy direction , definitely not for everyone , but I believe he 's worth your time . http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0000766 / ) All his films can be found with subtitles , but I strongly recommend `` Ulysses ' Gaze '' , `` The Travelling Players '' and `` Eternity and a Day '' . I 'm so glad you asked !

1 Yeah , there 's literally no one hopping on Cameron 's dick here .

1 And I love it . Plus , Christoph shows some great physical acting chops in that minute or so .

1 Dude ...

1 Back to The Future Trilogy

1 Do n't worry dude , I get it .

1 What a weird combination .

1 Me too ! `` NO ! MINE ! MINE ! MINE ! ''

1 The perfect Christmas movie .

1 nice article

1 I think it goes deeper than that , you should talk to a doctor .

1 You completely missed the point . He 's not upset because it 's green . He 's upset because he has to act alongside faces on sticks rather than actual people .

1 Martyrs is up there for me as well ! I regretted watching the film as soon as those people showed up at the house

1 Sight gags intended to be seen * are n't * `` Easter Eggs . '' They 're just sight gags .

1 The person trying to get him to do an AMA should propose it as something a bunch of celebrities have been doing to market themselves .

1 This is a perfectly valid strategy . We have the beer and lawn chairs .

1 If the justification for that ban is that sex is too dangerous yes . I 'm not saying it 's a biting satire or anything . If anything the movie is comically hyperbolic .

1 LOL . There 's a HUGE difference between `` Not being a big fan of old ( talking 30s and 40s ) movies '' and `` Only watching from 2000 onward '' . I 'm not the biggest fan of 30s and 40s cinema , I find it too slow-paced and not as refined as the medium wound up being later on . But to think there 's a huge difference between movies now and movies from , say 1985-onward and only watching stuff from the past 14 years is moronic , and I * personally * would n't date someone that close-minded .

1 You 're telling me !

1 Aaaaaaaaaand I need to watch Tomb Raider again .

1 are you really poking holes in the logic of invisibility cloaks ?

1 I remember hearing from somewhere that when they tried to make sure they had the Soyuz capsule 100 % accurate , the engineers would just keep saying `` There 's no window there . '' and the props people were just like `` Yeah , but this is prettier . Anyway , what else needs improvement ? '' `` There 's no window there . ''

1 I think you 're right . Everyone tells me to avoid jar jar and number 1 , but I still enjoy them despite his presence . I will do the original order , starting later this afternoon . Good times ahead ! Now the complicated bit ... deciding my movie snacks !

1 > a retarded mash up of Power Rangers and Transformers You say that like it does n't sound AWESOME .

1 Rug . Not carpet . You may need to watch it again .

1 In comic book Kick Ass 1 , she gets super pissed at Kick Ass for faking being gay , and she takes pictures of her giving her bf blowjobs and sends them to Kick Ass and she hates him forever and ever . So she was probably not in Kick Ass 2 very much since her character was so drastically different . In the comic Kick Ass 2 she gets raped and her dad is killed by the motherfucker . They probably figured that was way too graphic for a summer movie so they just left her character out entirely .

1 Wow my favourite film is X why has n't anybody mentioned X

1 So I dub thee

1 So those were screams of passion ... I did n't think of it that way before .

1 I need to start doing this

1 Yeah its a tragedy . Phillip Seymour Hoffman is definitely one of favorite actors but this provides a great opportunity of much needed comic relief for Mockingjay , which is pretty dark and intense . They could replace all of Plutarch 's lines with comments about dessert and hot pockets , whenever the audience is overwhelmed .

1 It 's a pretty fantastically produced piece of shit .

1 Those Cornetto ones are awesome !

1 Sleeper was going to be my suggestion as well . Holy cow that movie is funny .

1 Why else would the famous want to talk to the common folk ?

1 no

1 Yea . And puff daddy , green day , and jamiroquia .

1 I could only think of that uhh ... * one * GIF when he made that joke .

1 [ Well their happy was too loud ] ( http : / imgur.com / jWxv3 )

1 Nah , the ending is shit anyways . All they had to do was change the 150,000 to 40,000 or even 20,000 and boom , it makes a lot of sense .

1 Merci

1 The last sentence is a direct quote from Superbad * . * a Sony film from 2007

1 I hear they are filing suit against people who walked out of their film too .

1 Maybe someone was just trying to spoil the end of the movie .

1 But the thing is , it 's not biblically inaccurate . Practically everything that 's in the real story is there . The problem is the real story is super short , so there 's tons of room for the movie to fill in the missing pieces with their own interpretation of how the story went . People are just comparing it to their own interpretations and not realizing that a lot of what those interpretations consist of does n't exist at all in the real story .

1 I liked Legacy as well . I think they needed another 30 seconds to flesh out a pretty abrupt ending . I liked how they made Bourne / Cross a different breed . I also agree they got an awesome cast . You can tell Gilroy really worked hard to get the right people for the right parts . Norton especially you can tell he hounded down . And it shows because Renner , Weisz , and Norton are outstanding .

1 Good Will Hunting 2 : Hunting Season

1 You pussy .

1 And these are not the hammers

1 Not counting his numerous shorts , I 'll say Spike Jonze .

1 ETs nota tooma !

1 Do n't worry scro ! There are plenty of tards out there livin ' really kick ass lives .

1 I far preferred it to the other trilogy , even to the extent that it was my favourite superhero movie of the year ( possibly tied with Chronicle ) . The leads filled the roles so well , and it just looked and felt so much better .

1 Likely , but I did not even think about it the first time through .

1 I always get asked this question , and I never know how to answer it anymore ! I say `` get a second job and if you 're totally obsessed with movies , which I '' m sure you are , find a free outlet and just write as much as you can , hoping you 'll be the one person in the world who is discovered by a paying outlet . '' The cream still rises to the top !

1 To be fair , it 's hard to pull off that style of Irish accent . Even Liam Neeson said so himself .

1 Use the save button next time , no more comments for saving purposes !

1 I agree , but I think the way to do it is to set up jump scares that do n't happen . Here 's a comment I made earlier . `` See the thing about jump scares is that they are only suppose to happen twice . Once at the beginning and once at the end . The point of the first one is to put the audience on edge . Showing them that anything can pop out at any minute . What makes this effective is that by not having a jump scare again , you put the audience in suspense of something that wo n't happen again . That 's why the jump scare is genius . You make them think it can happen at anytime but do n't . The point of the second and final jump scare is for the payoff . Now that the audience has been waiting the entire time for the next jump scare , they let their guard down because it 's been like an hour or so . That 's when you let loose the second and final jump scare . That 's how jump scares are suppose to work , but people instead decide to make that the scary part and put them in every 5-10 minutes . ''

1 They planned five seasons originally and the material that ended up in season 2 was supposed to be spread across seasons 2 and 3 . When they found out they would not get another season , they tried to fit more into season 2 .

1 That part was cut out in the German release .

1 Like aliens chilling with us while we play video games .

1 I do n't think that 's the way it works with his children . In his dreams about his memories , he explained that the main reason he looks away when his children look around is because he only wants to see them in reality , because he does n't want to spoil his vision of his children in a dream . Damn , this movie has gotten my mind twisted thinking about the possibilities ...

1 the word is underexposed

1 This is a very good response , I agree with you on all points . They took all the cool parts of Ender 's Game , that would be flashy on film , and then told a story around that . To me it was Ender 's Game without the soul that made it worth reading .

1 whishaw was very good , humorous and self-aware , smart dialogue with craig and generally a fresh take on the character .

1 That movie already exists ; it 's called Robot Jox .

1 I was definitely thinking prequel the entire time last night . I 'd love to see John Wick working in that underworld , a movie based on the `` impossible task '' he was given to get out and watch him basically put Viggo into power .

1 Ha cha cha cha !

1 Aladdin 's actually saying `` Nice kitty ... ( whispering ) * Take off and go * `` to the tiger .

1 The first two movies earned 99m and 150m respectively , on top of budgets of 66m and 85m . Pacific Rim earned 411m on a 180m budget . The money speaks for itself .

1 * Fricken * lasers and * fricken * sharks . Get it right .

1 It will tie-in to the Avengers franchise though . Ant-man might show up in Avengers 2 and set up the character so audiences will be familiarised with the character before his own movie . I agree it will be cool because Edgar & Joe are a great team and Edgar 's an awesome director .

1 It 's basically * Mud * 's darker , more violent older brother . But it 's still worth watching . Cage and Sheridan are both very good , and it does offer a different tone to a similar story .

1 When you think about it , he kind of looks like who Anakin from * Phantom Menace * would grow up to be instead of Hayden . His features match better .

1 For those interested , this is Neeraj Kabi , and the film he lost weight for is * Ship of Theseus * , a beautiful philosophical drama released last year , and it was screened at TIFF . [ Here 's ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=p5xt0cKasDw ) the trailer .

1 Remember Leroy Jenkins .

1 Not to mention the amazing score !

1 I really do hope there is a final cut , with an extra 30 min or so on it of deleted scenes . Blade Runner is another example of `` What did I just watch , did i like it , yes I did ''

1 Spanking the Nazi monkey never felt so good .

1 As an Indian whose seen a great deal of older Indian films , I 'm grateful that a man like Scorsese recognizes the great film and culture in India . There are some great films that people have n't seen com india

1 I 'm guessing it 's a reference to Charlize Theron 's charactor in Fury Road , Imperator Furiosa .

1 Not THE Ring , and not ImmortalS . Big difference .

1 A WHAT ! ?

1 Same . This movie gave me nightmares about my mom dying . And then , a few years later , my mom died for real , which only amplified the profound feelings of loss that scene stirs up . Rough stuff for a kid .

1 The Sandra Bullock effect ( i.e . The Blind Side ) .

1 Harrison Ford did a lot of films after Star Wars ... A little known film called `` Indiana Jones ! ''

1 They have it on Wikipedia , but the only reference to that is comic-con 2006 ... A lot can change in 7 years .

1 That , and the FUCKING 30 MINUTES OF MANDATORY ADVERTISING before you even reach the DVD menu . I 'm no fan at all of pirates , but holy shit I have no sympathy left for the production companies that pull that crap . I will happily pay for the content I watch ... just give me the damn content that I paid for ! Fortunately , NetFlix streaming does just that , so let 's hope that selection continues to grow .

1 > but I never understood why Omar and his wife made fun of the religious guy for being a misogynist . It 's , like , are n't they actively supporting a movement geared around the most fundamentalist interpretations of Islam ? It 's highlighting the difference between extremist and devout . Not all extremists are devout ( e.g. 9 / 11 bombers were seen attending strip clubs I hear ) and not all devout are extremists ( e.g . The pope does n't go around bombing abortion clinics ) .

1 I mean , there is no real DEEP meaning that you could pick out really . Just a great movie showing the bond between two cops , and how much they meant to each other . The final scene showed just how much the other cop meant to Jake Gyllenhaal .

1 Holy crap I totally forgot about this film ! This scene is awesome !

1 lol `` tit nipples ''

1 I agree . And you can argue they play it for laughs once or twice . Like how Krushchev 's rise to power is secondary to Biff 's in the headlines . That 's pretty funny .

1 To be fair , he 's not an asshole . He sat through it the entire movie even though it continued to bother him . An asshole would have turned around and said : `` HEY DARTH VADER ! Do a favour to everyone you love and die already ! ''

1 http : / i.imgur.com / zJXH3Ey.gif

1 In this situation it would have to be Bourne . James Bond does NOT have a good track record of blending in , but it 's one of Bourne 's specialties . Just assassinating someone ? Bourne snipes Bond in Cairo the day after he finds out about the contract . Like jngrow says , Bourne 's an assassin , Bond 's a spy . If they had to infiltrate an organization or sleep with a girl it would be Bond . Of course , in the real world , we know they would team up .

1 sometimes i feel that some people do n't actually watch the film or have horrible memories .

1 Reservoir Dogs , Pulp Fiction , Seven , The Big Lebowski , Jurassic Park , The Truman Show , Fight Club , The Sixth Sense , Ravenous , Fargo , Gattaca , Saving Private Ryan , Silence of the Lambs , Goodfellas , Casino , Event Horizon , Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , Toy Story , Toy Story 2 , The Matrix , Blair Witch Project , Misery , Shawshank Redemption , Apollo 13 , Boogie Nights and Terminator 2 . And that 's it .

1 Let 's hope it 's handled a lot less clunkily than Pines .

1 you 're gon na love it , it was fuckin aewsome

1 That was the only thing I liked about * The Darjeeling Limited * .

1 That 's why I 'm very approving of the National Film Archive . They do n't induct a film until it 's at least ten years old which is a good marker for whether it 's stood the test of time .

1 I had high hopes for Ultimate Cap being portrayed as a man from the forties suffering from the culture shock of skipping sixty years of history and changing mores ; including watching his discomfort with the changed attitudes about race , gender , sexuality , and proper behaviour . ( There were some hints of this early on ) Instead I got the double-anachronism of a time displaced super soldier making disparaging remarks based on a stereotype * that did n't exist when he was frozen * .

1 Not really into sci-fi but will give it a go !

1 You stupid stupid idiot . What grade you were in when you saw Ep . 2 was really crucial to the post you made . I bet you do n't even major in STEM .

1 Shut the Fuck Up Donnie !

1 I want to listen but I just ca n't , I have to hear it for the first time in the film . So very tempting ...

1 Probably . MPAA has pretty strict guidelines . [ One example ] ( http : / www.rowthree.com / 2008 / 02 / 18 / us-indiana-jones-trailer-censored / ) being that you ca n't have guns pointed at another character .

1 do people know about them and use them ? This seems like pretty bad ass technology for the few who would like it . I 'm curious if they could grow a market for people who do n't speak english here and could watch a flick with everyone else with their native language being subtitled .

1 S - And he obviously has to like , use the whip to smoke weed , dude .

1 An * official * MCU Spider-Man ? Yes , yes it does . Considering the horrible job Sony has been doing so far ... two out of five ai n't that bad I suppose . I need this .

1 But the way he shoots that bunch of shit is what sets him apart . The guy 's considered an auteur by other filmmakers , even if most of his films are bad .

1 I was about that age and yes that book was my introduction to the existence of the word 'philosopher ' . Even now I think of that book when I hear that word .

1 Ca n't be that easy putting together a list of 100 facts from famous movies and have none of them be recognizable by someone . There actually was a surprising number of facts there that I did n't know ( unlike most of these lists I see ) , so I enjoyed it .

1 Dude , Yaphet Kotto and Harry Belafonte . If you do n't know who they are , look them up . Yaphet is in one of my favorite films of all time : Midnight Run . He 's fucking brilliant . As for Belafonte , his music was a huge part of my childhood . Three black actors on the posters is n't great for 17 movies , but it 's unfortunately all too accurate . Hollywood was very whitewashed then , and still is to a large degree .

1 I took away two things from this movie . 1 . Matt Damon is a jerk 2 . Matt Damon ca n't park for shit !

1 My favorite thing about Seven is that they did n't place it in a city . It could take place anywhere and I think that really helps make it seem timeless . You ca n't point at it and say `` Well that 's what New York was like in the 90 's . ''

1 Birdman

1 In driving miss daisy 3d it 's like you 're right there in the back seat with Jessica Tandy .

1 I always liked Rob Zombie 's cereal in House of 1000 Corpses - `` Agatha Crispies . ''

1 Big Night . That movie is just fantastic .

1 Thank you . Spider-Man and Wolverine are major Marvel characters . They are not major Avengers .

1 Do n't you mean beep 'em ?

1 Those are the same bricks they 've had forever and a day . They just used lots of them to get the hill look .

1 That does n't mean such , Marvel sign contracts with the actors to make sure they CAN use them , it does n't mean they have to fulfil the contract .

1 Fair use has nothing to do with if you 're making money or not .

1 What bothered me was that there was no sense of danger and going outside did n't mean instant death . First of all , if it was winter in Antarctica , nighttime should have been blizzard conditions , not windy southern Canada weather . Show the audience that you HAVE to use the ropes to get from camp to camp - like the 1982 version did . Without that , there is no danger when going outside . Secondly , when the building is on fire , you A ) Need to put it out , or B ) Get the fuck out . It felt like the actors were on a green screen and the camp on fire was put in later . They 're having a conversation , going into another room , looking around , and the fire is still blazing .

1 I expected one of the best movies of all-time , judging by the hype . I can agree that it was very well-done . But I just did n't like it too much .

1 never noticed those things really .

1 That 's not counting his films about the Blue-Footed Booby revenge / origins story and the Bedouin in late 19th century searching for the lost treasure of Agnew

1 Earlier today I read an interview with the guy who wrote the screenplay ( his name eludes me right now ) . He had the perfect response to those who feel the movie is glorifying the behavior of JB and other Wall Street types and an explanation on the essence of the story . Jordan Belfort is a charismatic , charming guy that has the ability to pull people in . He basically embodies the saying `` selling ice to an Eskimo '' . Leonardo does a fantastic job portraying that charm which ultimately pulls you , the viewer , in as well . So you find yourself laughing and having fun with him and his cohorts for the 2.5 hours only to realize at the end that you too have been duped by Jordan Belfort . He sold you make belief just like he did with the people he ripped off , only to have the facade completely crumble at the end to reveal all the depraved ugliness . That to me is essentially the brilliance of the movie .

1 I think the ending was debatable . Where are they taking Teddy to at the end ? To be lobotomized in the lighthouse ? The same lighthouse he broke into where no lobotomies were taking place , thereby proving his own insanity ? The `` twist '' was irritatingly predictable but the film is enjoyable anyway . There 's a lot there to like .

1 I always thought Elysium was a movie that should have just been a video game . Something about main characters in mechanized body armor just screams Video Game not Cinema to me .

1 I think the astronauts look great . They 're wearing these enormous suits that do constrict a lot of movement , and they 're also strapped into machinery . I 've watched a lot of astronaut documentaries and they 've all looked like that . I ca n't account for all the disaster footage , but that 's what they look like when repairing shuttles and telescopes . Additionally , I 'm not actually sure if its all CGI . They could actually be in costume and its all green screen . I 've read about how for many scenes , they put Bullock into a harness and moved the camera around her .

1 He left acting to raise his kids after his wife died . Very admirable .

1 I do n't care what anyone says , my all time favorite animated movie after I saw it , and I 'm extremely excited about the upcoming one .

1 It 's what my fingers did when I made the face , I dunno ask them .

1 That is actually the exact reason why a lot of songs are sped up .

1 Absolutely . Frank Booth , anyone ?

1 It 's not like he did n't have album titles that played on his name . It 's not any less contrived than naming the movie after any of his albums . Speaking of which , contrived ? It 's the title of a movie . We 're talking about something that is explicitly about the marketing and selling of the film , of course it 's contrived . Do you hold Hollywood to higher standards than that ? : P

1 Hearts of Darkness is a documentary about the production of Apocalypse Now . It 's an incredible film , that some say is an even better film then its subject . http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0102015 /

1 I do n't wan na say I 've seen The Dark Knight over a hundred times ... but I really do believe in Harvey Dent at this point .

1 Gekko does what 's best for Gekko . I think to an extent , he was trying to groom Bud , perhaps to one day take over or just have another person feeding him information . However , given the choice with his own freedom or Buds , Gekko will choose himself .

1 I 'm Sicilian . My father was the world heavy-weight champion of Sicilian liars .

1 How were those not realistic ? They used measurements from the actual mountain . The first stuntman to do a `` fall '' for the film broke three ribs and punctured his lung .

1 Clicked and closed ... have to stay strong .

1 Challenging & thoughtful , a look at the human condition versus the idea of the divine , there 's several ways to interpret it . I thought it was bold to depict Jesus as one who learns lessons that some would take for granted that he need not learn . A Scorsese movie that gets little attention , but it 's one of my favorites by him .

1 And when Captain America shows his list we get Steve Irwin and Skippy the Bush Kangaroo . Good to see skippy get the recognition he deserves

1 I feared that this would be silly only to be blown away by just how much heart they squeezed into this beautiful little film . I 've been recommending it to others only to find that they have similar reservations . I find myself insisting that people look past the surface and give it a try . So far , everyone who has watched it has been as impressed as I was .

1 Topless bikini ninjas . German ones .

1 And [ Paranorman . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=7mjlAItuw3s )

1 There is nothing wrong with the acting in that movie . Keanu was born to play a washed up athlete , turned FBI agent , turned surfer .

1 The 3rd one imo is by far the worst . I liked the first 2 but 3 is too low budget and they go into a lot of backstory that ruins a lot of good mystery stuff that made the first 2 so scary .

1 It looked `` cheap '' to me at first . Only when I realized it looked like that for a reason did I start to accept it , and then come to love it . I think it also puts more emphasis on the actors . They stand out more , like actors on a stage . And when you pay attention to these actors , you see some great stuff . Kevin McKidd in particular transfixed me .

1 But I mean , he 's right , there 's kind of no way around this . Unless we wait until black people are seen as completely equal in every way to white people in society , which , err , do n't hold your breath .

1 The Terminator ( 1984 ) . Arnie says this about Sarah Connor , just after plucking his synthetic eye out .

1 And what something would that be ?

1 The Exorcism of Emily Rose , Fallen , Demons ( 1985 ) , Hellraiser , Prince of Darkness , Stigmata , Possession ( 1981 ) . These are all pretty good examples I think of different types of demon movies .

1 I still like it well enough , but it could definitely benefit from being remade . But only , * only * if they use the same Queen soundtrack .

1 The talent in editing comes in timing . So the fact that the timing with the dissolves during the pans came out perfect when it could have been a total fuck up is like a combined talent between the editor and the director . So many things could have gone wrong with the editing though and the fact that it worked so well is remarkable . VFX most likely handled the shots where Michael Keaton was flying around . I imagine he was in a green screen room and wired from the ceiling or whatever . VFX team would have to work with the editor ( at least I think they do ) and composite in the outside footage and frame by frame remove the wiring or any noticeable rigging . Kind of a pain in the ass , but that 's what they 're paid for .

1 Puft *

1 I would love that . Just the thought of a parody scene in which there is an obscene amount ( literally thousands ) of over the top CGI ships in a fight with the Eagle 5 and they 're pushing them off the windshield with windshield wipers , would sell me a ticket .

1 Do n't worry . Marvel Comics agrees with you , that 's why it crashes almost constantly .

1 Europa Report was a pleasant surprise . It 's one of those rare sci-fi movies that really has its heart in the right place . It 's not exactly great , but definitely worth checking out .

1 Oh , god .

1 I had the same reaction . I will gladly pay $ 15 to watch a movie that 's got monkeys w / guns .

1 It 's actually less than three hours long , and I think that it would have been easier to understand if it was a bit longer .

1 I heard the cancer came back to his leg , but didnt think it was life threatening , wow this is sad news .

1 Does nobody get this joke ? Also , it 's a great movie .

1 Also towards the end of the movie when he rams his car full speed into another car then gets out . His headlights are sill in tact and there is no damage to the car . Fucking entertaining movie though .

1 and you get to eat six meals a day

1 The second she showed the device and how it worked , I knew it would kill one of them in the end . I assumed it would be the brother , since she brought him there and the predictable tragedy would be for her obsession to be the cause of her own brother 's death . But the way it worked out was probably better , with him in the cop car once again heading to an institution and nobody believing him . I thought it was a slightly above average horror film . Genuinely creepy at parts . I think with the core concept of the mirror they could 've done a lot more with it . I thought the questionable reality parts were great , while the straight-forward glowy white ghosts parts were pretty run of the mill .

1 One of the things I loved about * Malcolm in the Middle * was that Lois was n't just another hot actress opposite average over weight actor . [ Jane Kaczmarek ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0434223 / ) is still very looking , but she looked the part of a mother of 4 boys who worked a crappy job . -- - ( The thing I loved even more about * Malcolm * was that Hal was n't just another cliche incompetent idiot husband & dad . He was often an idiot , in delightfully humorous ways , but he was very much a competent parent & spouse , something so lacking in nearly every other sitcom . )

1 [ JFK ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0102138 / ? ref_=fn_al_tt_1 )

1 Good . I fucking hate Superman as an invincible red and blue Boy Scout . It 's so incredibly boring . This looks like an interesting take .

1 Uh ... humor ? You either get it or you do n't , I guess .

1 I was n't too big a fan of it to be honest .

1 When you get flop after flop from multiple `` A-Listers . '' Johnny Depp sure makes a convincing argument lately .

1 Damn there 's too many options . Goslings a god that has surpassed a trilogy .

1 And today is the day OP learned about this piece of trivia . There * probably * was a day when you learned about it too since I assume no one is born with this knowledge .

1 The smartest move of his career . It would have been his `` Showgirls '' and he would have ended up like what 's her name .

1 Barkhad Abdi as Mowgli . * `` Look at me ! * I am king of the jungle now . ''

1 He does n't fit the animation style or tone of the other characters . Scratt at least looked like he belonged in that universe .

1 Hanging with the weasel ... n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n

1 > I dont get why people dont jump over other movies where a group of people have to fight / kill and the winner gets freedom . It was only the world 's dominant form of adjudication for centuries . Rather than confirming their cultural knowledge , people who say Hunger Games is a ripoff of Battle Royale call it into question .

1 It is the marketing group probably and not the filmmaker . Check out the film , it is great .

1 Hot Fuzz !

1 in character as a recognisable personage from a historical period - it 's different , but your point is fair .

1 She actually is an executive producer , among others . I do n't think it 's often actor centrism as much as it is just a common way of relating someone 's involvement in a film , not necessarily that it 's `` their '' film . And she 's the one in the poster , so using her name seems quite relevant in this case .

1 This is n't the Taken movie , I think you 're confused it with [ this movie ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=uIABZEg61ik ) . My friend was one of the `` lucky '' ones to watch that movie . He says its basically the same story except that it takes place in Switzerland and his girlfriend is kidnapped . You just ca n't stop laughing when my friend explains the movie . When bollywood Neeson calls the bad guy and tells that famous dialogue , the bad guy tells `` Good Lake '' !

1 Time . You have a lot of it .

1 Oregon is probably my favorite location I 've ever shot in . In fact , I would probably shoot EVERYTHING there if they would raise the ceiling on the tax incentives ! There are so many varied architectural styles and amazing locations and fantastic talent . It 's a * great * place to work . I do n't want to give away the locations that we 've chosen for the Librarians in season 1 , but I think you 'll see amazing places that you 've never seen in any season of LEVERAGE . That 's how deep the well goes as far as locations there .

1 Is it supposed to be British ? Game of Thrones is n't actually the real world , it 's another world , I figured it would n't really matter if was a mixed accent .

1 This . First thing that came to mind when I read the title of the thread

1 They have entertainment value , just not at all in the serious , dramatic way they were intended . The whole sequence is awkward and it just comes off as feeling like it 's trying to one-up the opening the TDK , which then just gets you thinking about how good that scene was . TDK was a much stronger intro , and if we are talking about a scene `` standing on its own '' it certainly does , since it feels like it could be out of a legit heist movie , and is n't just part of a Batman movie . For you .

1 God dammit ! Why did you have to go and point that out for ? !

1 This would be cool , but [ unless Scott was being hypothetical in his comment here ] ( http : / www.hollywoodreporter.com / news / ridley-scott-michael-fassbender-noomi-206321 ) , I do n't hold out much hope for the movie making sense in a director 's cut . Re : reddat0r , the reason why the plot is convoluted is because Damon Lindelof is involved : )

1 I believe they explain it away by saying that the corporations that ruined the world built everything to basically automate , meaning there was n't any real innovation , just replication , but how far back the transition was made is a question worth pondering .

1 I was just thinking this too . I do n't know if I 've ever heard a woman narrator announcing names and such . Although , to be honest most trailers take the character narration approach anyway , now , for dramatic effect .

1 This point is strongly evidenced when he put There Will Be Blood on the list solely because it 's `` just so good . '' Fuck , why did n't The Godfather turn up on this list , since he 's gon na go by * that * logic .

1 Very underrated movie .

1 And then you are no better then they are . Someone would only do this because of a diseased mind . There may be no helping them and they should defiantly never be part of society again ; But torture is evil .

1 1st guy darting across came shockingly close to getting hit as well

1 RDJ only had one film this year . While Hanks and DiCaprio had more than one movie this year , they did n't do as well as The Rock 's big budget films such as Fast 6 , Pain and Gain , and G.I . Joe

1 No , reddit has never been good about social statistics . Ever .

1 Sucked so much .

1 Oddly enough , he behaves neither like a real hero nor like a real human being .

1 More likely he breaks Bruce Wayne 's back and JGL takes over . I still think Marion Cotillard is playing Talia al Ghul and that Bruce is getting his shit healed in the film 's equivalent of the lazarus pit .

1 Also features some of the best acting chemistry you will ever see

1 Yea but LOL TRANSFORMERS SUCKS ALL HATE ON TRANSFORMERS MUST BE UPVOTED LOL R / MOVIES HIVEMIND

1 I hope it does . The last one was well received and did good money both at the box office and on home video . It was n't the biggest hit in the world , but it was certainly successful , and I ca n't imagine a studio not wanting to jump in for a third .

1 There 's only two things you need to know about this film : A : It 's directed by Alejandro Gonz ? lez I ? ? rritu ; the same man who directed Amores Perros , 21 Grams and Babel . B : It stars Javier Bardem ; understand.. friend-o ?

1 Jonah Hill in * Moneyball * was also a good performance .

1 Exactly why I ended up disliking IM3 . The Winter Soldier stays relatively serious throughout the entire thing ( thank goodness ) . Throws one-liners and periodical light comedic relief moments every now and then ( balanced very well though ) . There are a lot more scenes with 'heart ' rather than cringeworthy attempts at comedy .

1 > does n't he still have Nathan 's keycard ? I 'm pretty certain that Ana used it to exit the building and kept it . > he rewrote the doors , but what about the phone in that room ? The phone is locked to Nathan 's card . That was in the dialog . If I wanted to waste time , I 'd draw a map of the house and determine what he had access to . As long as he has water , I think his survival is guaranteed . You are right to point out the door rewrite - he could try to trigger the generator offline and get doors to open without Nathan 's keycard . At this point he does n't have to worry about being destructive , getting in trouble . Nathan is dead and it looks like the robots went crazy . Both Ana and him are now famous : )

1 True , Joker is somewhat of a caricature . But there are people out there with given enough time and make-up come pretty darn close . I suspect Jared 's interpretation will be impressive on its own right however . He 's a top-notch craftsman , so it 'll be interesting to see how his rendition turns out .

1 Maybe then it would actually have won an Oscar . : (

1 No worries . Sorry you missed out - this time . The next one I buy , I 'll PM you and give you first dibs . : ) EDIT : Haha , I was so confused . I meant to reply to Wimachtendink 's comment . Cheers !

1 well that 's absurd . you do n't think mozart , beethoven , tchaikovsky , vivaldi , bach , brahms , stravinsky , wagner , haydn , debussy , berlioz , mahler , strauss , liszt , puccini , rachmaninoff , etc ... were n't absolute geniuses because they did n't live in your generation ? or because they were n't part of your generation 's pop culture ? maybe when you 'll get older you 'll appreciate things for what they are , as opposed to what people around you think they are .

1 For me , its a shitty interpretation of thor combined with my opinion that they are telling the wrong stories in the thor movies .

1 Yeah , Jet 's fate in A : TLA was obscenely ambiguous .

1 yeah , this is n't forshadowing so much as it is symbolism .

1 Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena completely compensated for the comical bad guys , movie was all about that chemistry between those two characters

1 Cause it 's a great movie

1 The ridiculous trailers for that move made it a sure post in this thread . I do n't know whether the `` goofy hijinks '' trailer hurt it , or helped pull in a larger audience who would n't have been sold on the darkly hilarious , ruminative journey that it actually is .

1 I wish people would let the Nolan Batman universe go . Let it stand on it 's own without having the actors in those roles again . Like the rumor that Liam Neeson was going to play Ra 's Al Ghul in Arrow or how Josph Gordon Levitt was going to play Nightwing in a spin-off or part of the next Batman movie or have him play Batman . Nolan made his movies now let someone else make theirs with other actors and different portrayals .

1 I like that Building Trilogy . All three movies I 'd have zero problem watching in a row .

1 I actually liked this movie as a whole sure there were problems , but I enjoyed it . And while I agree with you about beauty , I think the definition of `` fairest '' in this movie reached beyond beauty and into the `` snow white has an aura about her which is meant by destiny to lead '' and the queen does n't want to lose that . hence the conflict .

1 What movie ?

1 The movie is really not that hard to follow . It 's complex , but it 's not really confusing .

1 People are speculating based on the trailer . That does n't seem unreasonable . By the time we see it we 'll already have spent our 12 bucks on it

1 watching this reminds me of how great a communicator Peter Jackson is . he has brilliant ideas and presents them but still has time for his actors to voice their thoughts . it 's awesome watching him work .

1 They just had two Hitchcock movies come out . One of the dudes played Capote also . That guy just keeps getting screwed .

1 One EPIC film score to rule them all

1 I saw it tooo ! I swear there was the face scar - for an after credits scene like that it seems too much of a coincidence for it to just be an extra - what with the appearance of Trask on the television , Magneto and Charles Xavier crammed into 2 minuites

1 This just made me sad . I saw it two nights ago and it was incredible and now it 's closed .

1 You seem to be confused . This is n't the Expandables 3 . This * is * going to kick ass , even with a PG-13 rating .

1 Steve Buscemi is his name .

1 Umm , maybe you should read the synopsis or watch the trailer again , because your misgivings are based on a misunderstanding . The ISS is n't destroyed in the film . The astronauts are left adrift after their shuttle is damaged / destroyed during a spacewalk . They are trying to reach the ISS .

1 Don : we still get very emotional when we watch the movie . Roy : we really try to bring emotion to the films . Chris : the best Disney films of the past were not afraid of emotion . We screened to a comic con audience last night and the reception so positive and it meant so much to us .

1 I dunno why , but ... I trust you .

1 > Yes it does a nice job of capturing the early 2000s but is that really the point of a film ? What sort of message is that delivering besides producing high feelings of nostalgia ? The point of most of Linklater 's films ( the ones that he wrote , at least ) is that * there is no point * . His films are chronicles of life and what happens in life over a certain period of time ( one day [ * Dazed and Confused * ] , twelve years [ * Boyhood * ] , eighteen years and possibly counting [ the Before series ] ) . Life is n't defined by massive , dramatic events that only happen in the movies .

1 No . It 's a comedy . A black comedy , but definitely a comedy .

1 His dad did n't make slot machines , and I kinda think that 's his point .

1 I imagine a ( cynical ) Venn diagram of `` collectors '' vs `` people who buy worthless junk '' has some pretty serious overlap . However , if it 's worth it to someone to collect it , it 's not worthless by definition .

1 I do n't think he 's trying to -preach- his view , he just finds this kind of narrative compelling and decided to tell this story . The fact that he 's a bad writer is just the reason he could n't make that story very compelling .

1 You have n't even seen the film . I doubt that it 's going to be better than 2001 , but wait until you see it before you call it `` a nice-looking film about people floating in space without any philosophical implications or themes '' because you might just be wrong . I thought Children of Men was going to be a gritty Fifth Element , and it ended up being much more than that .

1 Script page . Script pages are supposed to be about a minute each , at least for spec scripts .

1 In Batman Begins , Wayne talks about how he needs to become a symbol . `` As a man I 'm flesh and blood . I can be ignored ; I can be destroyed , but as a symbol , as a symbol I can be incorruptible , I can be * everlasting * . '' ( emphasis added ) In TDKR , when Blake asks about the mask , Wayne says that part of it was `` * Batman * could be anyone . '' Not `` a hero , '' not `` the Dark Knight . '' Batman could be anyone . If Blake decides to take up a different `` hero '' identity , it defeats the purpose of the Batman symbol , and the point of the film series . It really bothers me that people are so hung up on the comic canon that they ca n't let these movies be something different . It cheapens the story , and it encapsulates why comic fans have been fed the same crap for almost a century . They do n't want something new .

1 Do n't you mean `` just Bing that shit '' ?

1 Very much the same feel it seems . In your face dark comedy .

1 I do n't know how it went so under the radar . It was directed by Ron Howard , starred an A-list celebrity , and was liked by critics and fans . Maybe it 's because it did n't come out during oscar season , which is more in the fall .

1 Best micro-review I 've read about the movie .

1 They occur periodically up to shoot date . For the projects I have been in We will do a sit down read after all of the principal cast has been chosen and then another one a week or two out of shooting with the whole Group as a legitimate rehearsal .

1 So you 're drunk and high on E , and the only thing that 's entertaining you is me ? I 'm honored and slightly concerned about your life choices .

1 They are the original props from Scott Pilgrim . One of her friends was a prop person on the set .

1 Sorry but I do n't exactly see how we as a society are becoming less violent . We totally are n't becoming a more civilized society . We may like to pretend that we are more civilized than lets say the Ancient Romans for example , but at the end of the day we enjoy violent spectacles just as much as they did . We 're still a bunch of dirty apes who like to fuck and be assholes to each other .

1 Character development ? What about the fact that the Man of Steel universe is clearly VERY different from the Dark Knight films ? We need a new Batman for this universe , not the same Batman ignoring all the history with the previous films .

1 > Why the hate ? Because it was an * objectively bad movie . * I believed that a knight guarded the holy grail for 800 years , and I believed that a shaman could rip out a man 's still-beating heart , and I believed that the arc held the power of god . I believed those things because I had no choice - the characters , the story and the filmmaking skill swept me up . The fourth film committed the worst possible sin : it gave Indy nothing to do . Our hero was thrust into a situation he had no personal interest in , then ordered to go from point A to point B by Russian soldiers , mentally damaged friends and ( finally ) a crystal skull . His encyclopedic knowledge of ancient cultures ? Wasted . His physical skill and endurance ? Used in the only the most generic ways . Did you notice how often he just stood around while other people took charge or performed crucial actions ? I 'm not saying he had to do * everything , * but it would have been nice if he 'd been useful more than twice . I signed on for * INDIANA JONES ( and the crystal skull ) * , not * CRYSTALL SKULLS ( with special guest Indiana Jones . ) * Why did he want the skull , anyway ? Because some Russian soldiers wanted it too ? Because these soldiers might find some kind of power in the lost city ? What power , exactly ? It was never made clear . The fact that they kept danging the threat of harming Indy 's loved ones to motivate him makes it obvious how little Indy cared about what the Russians were up to . And the villain . Ugh . The Nazis are a hard act to follow , but a Russian soldier who * may or may not * have been psychic does n't exactly make me shake in my boots . Am I really supposed to believe that she was Indy 's equal ? Why , because she has a sword ? And because she * might * be psychic ? Why not just make her full-on psychic ? She could predict Indy 's moves , get into his thoughts . That would 've been exciting . And what was * her * goal , exactly ? Was she ordered to find the lost city by her superiors , like the Nazis in the first film ? Did she fear their wrath if she failed ? Or was this a more personal mission , one that she had faith in even if the higher-ups did n't ? We need to know this stuff or we wo n't know how far she 's willing to go to succeed . For all we knew , she was minutes away from saying `` fuck it '' and heading back to the mother land . ( I know I was . ) As for the fridge scene - I actually liked this scene for one simple reason : watching him try to escape from the atomic blast was the * only time in the film * where a ) I knew exactly what was at stake for his character and b ) I got to see him escape using nothing but his wits . The scene worked , even if it was dumb as a rock . As for Mutt : > He was n't the most interesting of characters , but there was n't anything overly bad about him . Do you really think that 's good enough for an Indiana Jones movie ? WE LOVE THESE FILMS BECAUSE WE LOVE THE CHARACTERS . Adding a character as bland as Mutt is an insult to the audience .

1 You 're exactly right if you are talking as an ISP . This is their biggest fear . This is why we are seeing more bandwidth caps and the same speeds from years ago . The easier it is to get your entertainment online , the less people will be paying for a cable box . Their control over the connections is going to cripple progress of faster speeds , cloud storage , high definition content , digital distribution of games , movies.. etc . This graph showing Netflix as the most traffic shows this * is * the direction we are going in , and ISP 's will do everything they can to get in the way .

1 early on it was still pretty good , but yea .

1 Yeah ! Do you know how many 13 year olds have licked my junk ? !

1 Charlie Hunnam is a pretty boring actor in general . His accent is also really jumbled and confusing , all the time .

1 > You 're the reason these films are being made , and it pisses me off that you do n't care . God forbid people can like other things than you and that their view which honestly is as valuable as yours create billions in the film industry .

1 I 'm a Catholic whore , currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black Jewish boyfriend who works at a military abortion clinic . Hail Satan , and have a lovely afternoon madam .

1 You sound like a good parent . Have an upvote sir / ma'am ( most likely , sir ) .

1 He was 10X more menacing in the trailers than in the final version .

1 There were some scenes in BV that hit waaaaaaaaay too close to home .

1 I thought it looked better than the first one .

1 I like this stabilized version of the Millenium Falcon scene in the new Star Wars trailer . No unnecessary spinning around to make it look more flashy . http : / i.imgur.com / Y3bpy1p.gif

1 > I thought it should 've been Boyhood . I 'm okay with Birdman winning , but I thought Boyhood was slightly better Haha it 's so refreshing to hear them talked about like that !

1 Wolf of Wall Street

1 I grew up not far from Chicago . The Blues Brothers and Ferris Bueller 's Day Off were / are mainstays of my movie watching .

1 Thanks for the info I had no idea the movie had relatives .

1 Yeah I felt like I was the only person who did n't like it . I did n't have a problem with the story apart from it being called `` Mad Max '' when the story is n't even a little bit about him . He 's just along for the ride and kills some people . I thought while the action was great , it was boring because it was essentially the same scene every time : A bunch of cars attack the truck while driving in the desert . If the film was 30-45 minutes shorter I would n't have been so bored and might have enjoyed it more .

1 I 'm not really sure ... I found it quite interesting . : )

1 The funniest trivia about the book was when it was read by a US congressman who sat on a US Navy subcommittee . Since Tom Clancy used a lot of realism in his novel , the congressman assumed that the Soviets actually had a very quiet `` caterpillar drive '' , but for some reason , he had never been briefed on it . So he had an aide call the Pentagon and ask what was going on . The first several naval officers had no idea what the aide was talking about , until finally a junior officer , who had read the novel , chimed in .

1 ITT : People being downvoted for answering the question

1 i could n't agree more .

1 Wait , you 're sure Spielberg did n't temporarily time travel Lincoln 's ass out of there and film the thing ?

1 I 'm hearing that this may be a hoax http : / www.cinemablend.com / new / UPDATE-Star-Trek-Darkness-Trailer-Appearing-Any-Time-Soon-33610.html

1 It seems about right according to Wikipedia : http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Beorn # Appearances

1 These are awesome . Hope he does Kubrick next !

1 I 'm a pretty euphoric guy in general

1 does n't mean you should over-generalize every adaption as `` bad '' . There are plenty of bad ones but there are some very excellent ones .

1 [ You , the Living ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0445336 / reference ) for the mastery of wide shot composition . [ Three Colors : Red ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0111495 / reference ) for the mastery of motif and symbolism through color .

[ The Conformist ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0065571 / reference ) for the mastery of dynamism .

1 JJ Abrams has been pretty good with trailers though , I 'd say . Him and Chris Nolan .

1 No , Mad Max had a strong plot . But it was SIMPLE . It was n't more than it needed to be for the ACTION part of the film to work . That is proper action movie making .

1 Well alright then ...

1 Rule 34 , Pookie . Personally , the only one that ever put a shiver in me was the [ Pregnant Batman ] ( http : / www.ruedelachouette.org / wp-content / uploads / files / 2010 / 11 / superman-with-pregnant-batman.jpg ) pic that gets a lot of mileage on /r/WTF subs , though there is some harsh shit of a chokey / snuffy nature that seems a little ... aggro for my liking . But honestly , my main complaint with the genre on a whole is how aggressively sexual the subtext often is , and how little it 's recognized . It just feeds into that whole , `` Dominator=good / male , Receptive partner=bad / weak '' trope that 's been played out since the beginning of time , and * every * culture seems to feed it , nurture it , yet there 's * no * shortage of receptive partners , and even the Alphas among us get ... curious about the nature of the beast . It 's a bullshit disingenuous thinking that I feel we need to move beyond as a whole , maybe evolve past . But it 's funny , whenever I put up anything mildly homoerotic , almost entirely as a goof , there 's always a vocal minority of `` EEEEEWers '' that get a spectacularly bad reaction to it , and I see , `` Glad * I * stopped reading as soon as I realized * what was up ! * `` Oh , you rumbled me , you clever , masculine fellow . Well done .

1 Just set it in 20XX . Worked for Mega Man .

1 Worse than Rachel ?

1 Is it hailed as a 'great ' film ? I thought it was really entertaining and unique , but 'good ' at best . Its best quality is that all of the characters are shitheads , but they are all linear and effected by their own shithead behavior . Clive Owen 's character is the only one I found remotely interesting . In the end nothing really changes . Again entertaining and beautiful - not a great film .

1 Oh man , good for him ! I hope he gets more roles after that . He was absolutely excellent in ST12

1 already classic

1 I was being sarcastic . I would have said Jar Jar Binks , but he does n't fit in between ESB and RotJ .

1 he said * bad * movies

1 Word bitch . Phantoms like a mother fucker !

1 I LOVE malick . I know it polarizes people , some love , some hate his films . I for one LOVE them

1 You can discuss while tagging spoilers .

1 So sad ; this dude made my childhood awesome with Clash of the Titans , Jason and the Argonauts and the 7th voyage of Sinbad . RIP Mr. Harryhausen .

1 People do things in that movie that make no sense - just to further the story . Watch Prometheus and then watch Alien , make your own mind up .

1 `` Did you get a gun ? I did n't get a gun ? ''

1 ^underrated post

1 Seriously . They 're talking like , `` Oh , woe are we , gone are the days when TRU TALENT existed ... '' as though making a matte painting is any less labor-intensive than recreating the same scene in pure ( or hybrid ) CGI . Talent has n't evaporated with the introduction of computer generated imagery , it has simply changed forms .

1 Did you use the slider ? You can slide to see the full pictures of the actors both in and out of make-up .

1 You seem upset . I was simply asking if you 'd read the book .

1 but for real ... it 's great !

1 Sandler is . He was great in Punch-Drunk Love and is doing a Jason Reitman movie soon .

1 Same here . Total crapfests .

1 I love that you 're being downvoted for specifically saying that she is a good actor but that you do n't like her anyway . Screw you for having an opinion . But I 'm on the same page , I 've just never really been fond of her overall . She has some great individual performances but certainly not a career full .

1 I was expecting him to be a villain all the way through pacific rim . I was actually surprised that he did n't take a darker turn .

1 LEAVE TEAM FORTRESS OUT OF THIS !

1 Look I 'm not arguing this is some grand injustice that will destroy the fabric of society but then neither is Piracy . Piracy is something that is prominent in Australia but could also be fixed very easily . When the distributors want to do that piracy will decrease here , until then they will lose money on our shores . This is n't a justification this is the reality . Think of it this way , the past two weeks all you 've heard about if you 've been on the internet is North Korea and The Interview . How it has been pulled , how no one will see it anymore . Suddenly you find out that its become available for download on youtube and google . You 're interested , and up until this point you have been in the same conversation as everyone else , you 've kept up to speed , so you go to download it but then see you are region locked and ca n't pay for it . Now you could wait however long Sony would like to make you wait for an arbitrary release stagnation , or you could just download a high quality copy off one of the many torrent sites that are available right now . Why not ? It would be easy to go and download it , and you do n't have to wait to join the global conversation about it . Do you think people really care that a giant conglomerate like Sony wo n't get their $ 6 because Sony decided to stagger the release of their movie ? Of course not , people do n't give a shit about piracy , it 's just a thing they do because it 's a more convenient option .

1 Silver Screen Fiend ? It 's great

1 I do n't think there should ever be a Space Jam without Michael .

1 Yeah . I had this problem too . I loved the movie up until the part where they enter the mountain , where I felt it really lost gusto . Also that weird overly cheesy romance with Tauriel .

1 That 's not the point . . not at all .

1 Definitely , if only for the Christopher Walken Performance . He did One and Two . The sequels are * meh * , but I loved the concept and mythology . A remake is definitely in order .

1 Honestly did n't notice . But i 'd cry in front of this man just to have him tell me my love is real lol

1 Yep . The chicken .

1 100 times easier ? No . Earlier ? Yes .

1 Turn that frown upside down ! : )

1 I took a chance and redboxed it . Was definitely a great surprise .

1 Doubtful , but ya never know . Django was co-produced by Columbia . I 'm thinking anything with a co-production or shared distribution rights * might not * make the cut . So things like Rambo , Django and Basterds could be a no go , while things like The Master , Killing them Softly , and Fruitvale Station could be yes . Going through the list of whats already streaming theres evidence to support this . They already offer stuff thats specifically WCO like : The Artist , The Company Men , Kings Speech and so on .

1 Guy Fawkes

1 It 's not purely the Human Project ( the movement in the film to discover a cure for the elonged infertility ) that makes it sci-fi . The very premise that `` women have stopped having children inexplicably '' is a very plausible one , making it a perfect science fiction candidate . Sci-fi is n't so much about `` future '' and moreso about imaginary events that could be plausible in our current universe and knowledge of science . The opposite of this is fantasy , which relies on magic and the supernatural .

1 that 's a weirdly good description of what I just experienced .

1 Yeah , it 's not 2015 yet . Fuck you .

1 Thank you . I 've already had to tell my fb friends to stop freaking out from a page that does n't even link any actual announcement sources and linked them to that exact same article . It was a rumor after recent mass layoffs at Ghibli but they are n't shutting down .

1 Haha , there is a slight difference between defecating in a box and spending a large portion of your life dedicated to making a film but I see your point . I am a fan , and am probably far more willing to accept the more out there ideas from him because of this . But I see nothing wrong with that either , I enjoy his work . If you really do n't like the idea , why not just not see it ? Also , if Clerks 3 is a movie and Clerks 5 is shit in a box , then I really wan na know what happens with Clerks 4 ...

1 Why not ? It 's already a pretty shaky plot .

1 That 's so mean .

1 I think you 're being a little harsh . I like the outfit , its better than all those stereotypical costumes with plastic pecs and tight pants . But that 's just me . I 'm still excited for the movie . : D

1 Thanks ! I have a bad habit of losing batteries so I ended up smoking after 3 months of only vaping . Got a couple new ones the other day . I missed my sweet , sweet e-juice waayyy more when I was smoking than I miss smoking when I 'm vaping . Haha .

1 Wait , what ? Ride along ? Over 100 million ? I mean I think Kevin Hart is funny ( even though he 's just a shorter version of the 90s Chris Tucker ) and Ice Cube is pretty decent at acting considering his fame came from being a gangster rapper straight outta Compton but I would have never guessed it made 100 million

1 If you knew it was going to suck then why did you waste your money on it ? I hate this logic so much . Nothing form the trailers or interviews indicated it was going to be any different .

1 I dunno ; guy never tells me anything .

1 No , no , that was Water Ship Down you are talking about.. I felt brain raped after seeing that film as a child ...

1 I never said he did n't bulk up for the part , but he 's obviously wearing molded rubber . Just look at the chest and abs .

1 Referring , of course , to the erection that the thought of JP4 is giving me .

1 Edge of Tomorrow was actually based off a novel or manga . All you need is kill iirc . Still a very good movie . Chef and Nightcrawler were other insanely good original movies that relatively few people saw .

1 Oh man , if only he had said that ! !

1 2 Star Wars novels but i get your point . Also , it wasnt his choice to off Chewie . There was what , 6 authors in all in the series ? They discussed with Lucas how it was gon na go and all broke up the series . Yeah , Salvatore got the Chewie book but i thought he handled it really well , the death was majestic and if chewie had died in a ship or being shot , i would have been really really annoyed . Getting killed by having a planet thrown on you whilst saving Anakin Skywalker ? Amazing death .

1 How does it feel to crash a website ?

1 It 's a book series by Richelle Mead , the books were very serious and actually pretty good ... pretty much the opposite of how this movie is looking

1 That 's what we call `` an opinion ''

1 Wife and I .

1 I consider this a great film .

1 Wrong pacing , he needed it broken up more . Still , I liked DeathProof for it 's twist on violence against women in horror films . That , and as lingfoo said it 's got a great payoff . I liked Death Proof but honestly do n't find Resevoir Dogs to be that great . Both good films but my favorite scene he 's done - the opening of Inglorious Basterds and the stress / dialogue , best stuff he 's ever done imo .

1 `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? '' was the first thing that came to mind , but I do n't know if that qualifies under your criteria seeing as how it 's animated characters interacting with live-action environments and actors . But still , one of my favorite movies and one of the most unique movies ever made , and it still holds up very well , visually and story-wise .

1 Very well thought out . I actually agree . Well done .

1 He answered your question by revealing it to be disingenuous . You claimed that American films do n't show American injustices . He responded by giving examples of American entertainment media that DO show torture and abuse . You 're also grasping at minutia to stick with your point , which is rather pathetic . `` Yeah you mentioned torture BUT you did n't mention sexual assault so I 'm still right ! '' You ever stop to think that maybe , * if * you 're right , it has to deal with American media censorship and morality standards , or some other reason outside of your fragile little cocoon of causes ? I disagree that VICE fills any void , since it 's not a major player in modern American media , and it is also often gonzo journalism . However , it does support the idea that many American media voices depict and focus on the injustices you talk about .

1 op is talking about editing not ending .

1 Please be real .

1 Wrong pic .

1 I hate when the sex-scenes are so prolonged that you just know they put it in to create awkward situations for familys trying to watch a simple action flick . Sources : My childhood .

1 I 'm somehow interested in seeing Sigourney Weaver wasted , but I do n't think we 're talking about the same thing .

1 His outfit will be made by Nike in the movie and they will take multiple shots featuring the logo . Like Chevy in Transformers .

1 They arent twins . They are two of around 25 Wolf kids .

1 you mean the Fourth wall . Movies break the 3rd wall all the time . And yeah . Return of the Jedi is the most ruined of the special editions . With the Cantina area stuff in A New Hope ruined the most . ( Han shooting second , the whole awful scene with Jabba )

1 Yup it ? s kinda sad that they spoil the interal battles and the climax .

1 These guys are both awesome !

1 `` They did n't even acknowledge it . '' I lost it !

1 Works for me on mobile

1 It is slow , but that 's what makes the ending so much more rewarding ! Also , nice to know there is a fellow Seven Psychopaths fan out there ! However , i think that movie is a bit more of a commentary on film , rather than a movie itself . But i 'm just babbling , i enjoyed the shit out of it either way .

1 > Uh no . That 's the point . People have the right to be fucking selfish . That 's my point : they totally do n't . We as a society invest in them by giving them education and security from criminals and protecting their liberties , providing their primary needs if they ca n't fulfil them themselves , and allowing them access to the limited resources of this earth . They * have * to give back . It 's also our moral duty to help people in need . Not just as individuals , because then millions would not be helped , but as a society , and for that we need money of those who would n't give money themselves . If we would allow the rich to keep their money , then those who would n't give would outcompete those that would . By market principles , generous people would be selected against : the free market rewards assholes and punishes empathy and random illness . > there is no such thing as `` too big to fail '' in capitalism There is : market panics are possible , economic systems can collapse , and tens of millions of people can lose their job if a corporation , bloated by the lack of restrictions on capitalism ( because monopoly or oligopoly is many times more profitable than polypoly ) , becomes so massive that their collapse damages the economy . > folks on both sides of the aisle The American electoral system is a travesty . An insult in the face of democracy . Where you see a reasonable argument , I see a great mountain of puss . > you think our current financial predicament is a result of capitalism Without capitalism the global economy would be too different for me to predict . The current crisis , relying on banks , could n't have occurred by definition , so I guess I do think that , but that was n't what my reasoning behind that comment was . I was n't arguing for the abolishment of capitalism - I support the idea of sociopolitical experimentation but again that is n't the point - but merely for the heavy regulation of it ( by competent governments . The American government as an institution has to be rebuilt from the ground up ) as well as socialism in general . > I see what you 're saying about a transparent system . If you really believe that then you should be against any sort of government involvement at all , because in that corner things are just getting more and more opaque . Like a brick wall . In my country , the current level of opacity makes a socialist state more reliable than a capitalist one . In an ideal world I would choose a socialist transparent world , but when faced between an opaqueish but competent socialist government and the free market ( with all it 's black hole-level transparency and it 's organic molecular cloud level of obfuscation ) , I 'll choose the socialism every time .

1 I have some bad news

1 Regardless of my opinion on your opinion , it would be pretty much impossible to build the cg sets shown in this breakdown ; the massive underground hangar is ridiculous to even think about building and the glass bubble thing would have to have an digital skyline no matter what , plus it would be incredibly dangerous and difficult to film stunts that high off the floor . tl ; dr : I disagree .

1 Jeffery Dean Morgan looks like Robert Downey Jr . 's dad . Javier Bardem ( Chigur from No Country for Old Men ) and Jeffery Dean Morgan are the ones who really look similar . I call the former Brown Sugar and the latter White Sugar .

1 I 'm pretty sure people would complain if they announced Hawkeye was to be a `` huge part '' in the next film . People without superpowers in a superhero movie are pretty boring .

1 you must not have seen The Guest . I watched it last week and it is great visually .

1 I hope so . Surely that 's what the Avengers 'universe ' of movies should be , different directors trying different things to put their marks on different characters . Captain America / Thor felt a little samey and by-the-numbers .

1 very good !

1 Here 's our request ... And dedication .

1 First time seeing a FunnyOrDie skit thats 78:55 ... .

1 Half of reddit hate Cloud Atlas , the other half like it . I 'm in the latter category .

1 YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS ?

1 The point I want to make is that I do n't blame Shyalamaladingdong for Jaden 's performance . I think that he can get great performances out of his actors . Avatard and The Crappening were exceptions , but he did an admirable job specifically in terms of the performances in Smith Family Robinson . I 'm not saying it was good , just as good as it ever was going to be regardless of the director .

1 Yeah the movie would have been fine if it ended with him performing his vampire musical .

1 The Warriors .

1 Well Colbert always called him Li'l Kim .

1 > There is just no tension or effective buildup , stuff just happens . You realize there was like half an hour or more of movie building up to this scene , right ? You literally just saw the end result of the 'buildup ' .

1 Cubase 7 for the music , premiere pro for the video

1 Honestly , he could reprise his own role if they rebooted Dune .

1 Dat ice .

1 If you 'd watch the video , you would see that he has an Israeli lawyer who is helping him sue Cohen . `` For lots and lots of money '' .

1 do n't do drugs kids .

1 It..it.. was.. su..su..surely.. one of..of the ... the best ... best.. spe..speeches in.. in.. film .

1 WHATS IN THE BOOOOOOX ! ?

1 I ca n't do it

1 If this is true , and it 's in front of the camera , then it 's probably a role in CA3 or Dr . Strange as I doubt they 'd start filming in Spring 2015 on a film for mid-to-late 2017 . Because Dr . Strange is a new character , they 'd probably focus on him exclusively . So CA3 would actually make sense , especially since we saw Maria Hill joining Stark Industries at the end of CA2 . A Hawkeye movie also is n't out of the question .

1 Some of these could so easily be used in Bojack Horseman

1 It 's sort of a good step into the art house genre , because at it 's heart it 's an action film , but they way it 's told is through art house techniques . If you can make it through Drive , they should then move onto some more of Refn 's films like Bronson and Only God Forgives , which are a wee bit more art house .

1 This reminded me of the scene in `` Waiting for Guffman '' where the guy auditioning does the `` You f * k my wife ? '' dialogue in front of all of his judges . : - )

1 That scene is in the movie , but with only one targeting laser . You can actually see that the other were added to amp up the trailer . They interact with Adrien Brody 's skin very differently than the one that was actually intented to be there .

1 The trailer was a woman singing .

1 YEAH ! Glad to see them doing these shorts .

1 I agree . And further hats of to all filmmakers that take the time and trouble to put a decent ending on a film . There are so many films that are great rewarding cinematic experiences but which have flat predictable endings , like the production ran out of steam and so they run the credits . True artists are going to craft an ending just as worthy as the other parts of the film and It ? s narrative . Hats off to those that make a good ending !

1 Eh ... except they had specific powers and dominions that synergized with their appearance , name , etc. , very much like the Greco-roman ( edit : or Norse ) pantheon . There 's a lot of christian influence in Tolkien 's mythos but it 's not christian allegory .

1 At the time it was , no question . The bar has since been raised again and again and again . ( the dark knight , the first iron man , and avengers all raised the stakes of what could be done in a superhero movie , albeit in different ways )

1 All films are capable of using surround sound effects , and often do . The majority of film soundtracks are multi-layered , mixed and balanced masters that incorporate some directional audio effects , that probably go unnoticed due to the density of sounds your being subjected to . Your position in the cinema , amount of onscreen action and the level set by the cinema will all effect the success . I have n't seen it yet , but the fact Gravity is set in space probably means they would have incorporated the silence of space as a feature of the soundtrack , which would amplify the other sounds your hearing , including surround effects .

1 This unfinished scene did n't look like a finished scene , and I will blame this exclusively on better framerates !

1 No , `` The Score '' is n't a remake of `` Thief '' . They are both heist films , but are fairly different in character . In my opinion `` Thief '' is the better film , but they are both worth watching if you like the genre .

1 Orci , Kurtzman and Lindelof are nowhere near this .

1 As a Mississippian , allow me to say ... .Watch your mouth boy .

1 He 's still a damn good Bond , he just was given three movies that were n't as good as his first and on some occasions were downright terrible . But IMO his performance as 007 remained consistently of a high quality , though many will argue that even Brosnan seemed pretty tired of it all by * Die Another Day * .

1 Do n't know yet . There 's [ an official website ] ( http : / whatwedointheshadows.com / ) that will hopefully post the news .

1 So let 's make a spectacle about it

1 Just like Cuba

1 Ah yes , the good old , `` I have AWD , I do n't need to drive carefully in the winter ! ''

1 The second film is basically a remake with a higher budget .

1 I agree . I was somehow prepared for a rape scene , which still shocked me , but that goddamn extinguisher scene ... and the arm . Oh my fucking shit . To this day is , it 's shittiest I 've felt after leaving a movie theater .

1 Watch [ Inside Llewyn Davis ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt2042568 / ? ref_=nv_sr_1 ) for both Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver

1 I 'd say it would be around 16 where I live . Thanks for answering !

1 SHOW ME THE MONAY !

1 Thank you ! We just had our four year anniversary . And for a dude that never thought he 'd get hitched , it was the best decision I ever made . Though admittedly I do n't make many good ones . I 'll definitely give that documentary a watch . Chris 's story and Krakauer 's book were certainly things that weighed heavy on my mind on a daily basis . He never compromised himself , which is as rare and commendable a trait as one could hope for . RIP Chris . : (

1 oh yea that TIL that got to the front page ... i always tell ppl about that and they think im just fucking with them

1 [ That 's the credit from Moonlighting 's `` Taming of the Shrew '' episode . ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0651043 / ? ref_=ttqt_qt_tt ) I wonder if it was a play on the popular Letterman character Larry `` Bud '' Melman ? 1986 episode , that seems like it would have been timely . It sounds like a Herman Melville `` Billy Budd '' reference to me , but that 's highly unlikely .

1 Reported for advertising .

1 Right ! There are a lot of absurd things in that movie . I really wanted to like it too .

1 I get the whole `` give WW a love interest '' type thing , but I do n't agree with it . We 've officially passed up the milestone where we do super hero movies with women in them that suck . The only time we 've tried was with Elektra , and that was completely awful ( to be fair the character in general is awful , not just the movie ) . We just need one single female superhero that can prove they are a badass who can stand on their own two feet without having to be arm candy for a different hero , just one . It might as well be the most famous female super hero that 's ever existed . And let 's be honest ; in reality , she would have never had any interest in a male character anyways . She lives was raised on an island with other half naked women that celebrated a roman theme and praised strength / competition above all else . Not saying they should play a same-sex angle with her either , just keep it neutral and keep it out of the same love-death-trap they 've put every other attempted hero in . I mean look at Black Widow , aside from the fact that she 's smoking hot , they could n't do a movie with her as a main character without her being `` emotionally attached '' to someone ( `` I owe Hawkeye soooo much , boo boo hoo hoo~ '' ) Green Lanterns casting was fine . Ryan Reynolds is still an ideal candidate for future Green Lanterns . They were even ambitious enough to go after such a major evil dude in the first movie , very nice . The writing was terrible though , and the lead in to a Sinestro sequel was simply forced . You could tell they only did it because thats what Marvel does . Dr. Manhattan , as cool as he was , could not have been the main character of a movie at all . He had to be part of a team because he is CGI , and people do n't like seeing a pure CGI `` main character '' . It reaches Uncanny Valley quickly , and then you see the box office numbers announce the death of the concept . If we need a JLA movie with love interest , let it be Aquaman and his queen , or Black Canary and someone else . Hell I 'd settle for a Titan movie with the Starfire & Robin angle ( loved the cartoon , was n't as taken with the newer incarnations of Titan comics that have been released since ) .

1 but its critically well-recieved ... so no

1 The first interstellar poster is really neat . The movie comes out in about 2 months and we still have n't seen any official new posters . There 's so much potential to have nice posters for the film .

1 They 're all photoshopped in .

1 It has a couple of moments that were good , like the moment i got up and went to the kitchen for a drink . Man , I was thirsty .

1 I can guarantee you that every photo in the feature is photoshopped . Not a single one of their PR people would let an un-photoshopped photo out .

1 It 's a classic !

1 MINT flick , re-watched it last night..least preachy Spike Lee joint , absolutely love it !

1 > It appears that Jesper Christensen , who played Mr. White in QOS and CR , has signed on to be in Spectre . Oh , thank god . I would never forgive them if they just dropped that thread entirely . QUANTUM and Mr. White was one of the great things CR and QoS had going for them and I was disappointed when it was n't addressed in Skyfall .

1 He 's even the same character in the new NWA movie !

1 This is because the Swedish legal system files every instance of sexual assault as a separate record , so if a husband rapes his wife every night for a year before she finally goes to the police that is filed as 365 cases of rape in Sweden whereas in most countries it would be one ( and in some 0 as it is legals to rape your wife in certain countries ) . Comparisons of statistics do n't take this and other factors , such as a broader definition of what rape is and generally a better system for decreasing the number of unreported cases ( including women being more likely to report in the first place ) , into account which falsely inflates the statistics .

1 So you have a sense of humor and a highly appropriate username

1 Pretty much the entire Snatch soundtrack . I loved the use of The Stranglers , The Specials , and 10CC as well .

1 No , he wants to see the part where he 's ... detoxing , I guess is the right word .

1 This completely . I thought Avatar was amazing and a beautiful film to watch . Sure , the story was n't that great , but it really was n't that bad either . I 'll never understand the anger of some folks on the Internet .

1 Yeah , I stopped seeing that movie .

1 I disagree . It is n't nearly as bad as this review implies

1 Is Cargo set before or after Argo ? I tried to watch the trilogy in release order but it did n't make much sense to me . The other two do n't follow on from Fargo very well .

1 I personally love the ending of the film , despite it 's abrupt change in tone . I think it 's one of the few times in the history of film in which the sentiments of the common man are allowed to be expressed so clearly and directly . I also feel that if there was ever a time for sincerity and sermon , it would be at the start of WWII .

1 from the comments LOL - `` shyamalamalama is a shitbender . ''

1 Find your animality ! ! !

1 ( Think hes talking about the one with the hat )

1 Animal House is a classic piece of humor . It should never be remade .

1 This video ca n't be played with my current set up .

1 This is the first list I 've seen that included Inception . That really deserves to be on here

1 http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=bpVXpCNFOSg Edit : I see I 'm not the first to post that link in this thread . That 's kind of awesome .

1 They are also children . Folks miss the teenage part .

1 The quality of the footage was so high that I noticed that Bane and Pavel are dummies when they blow the cockpit of the plane around them and it falls .

1 I 'd forgotten about that speech . My go-to thought with that movie is when Goodman beats up a bunch of ninjas and then calls them `` non-jas ''

1 Just thinking about the kind of force required to do that to a person makes me shudder .

1 I respect your opinion , but it 's stupid .

1 And the office and Breaking Bad

1 You mean the only freaking blurry part in the all damn trailer ? : )

1 The Green Mile

1 They were over budget and had to cut somewhere . Kept the nipples but scrimped on the capes and script .

1 So basically , a middle finger to fans of the original .

1 It was a prankumentary . Watch the film , `` I 'm Still Here '' . Casey Affleck made it with Joaquin Phoenix , since they both found it hilarious to stay in this crazy , turned -- undeniably awful -- rapper , on drugs all the time man .

1 Yer a little messed up are n't you kid ?

1 This . His entire story is a long coming-of-age story .

1 Is it the plot , acting , or the singing ? I thought it was better than expected .

1 Makes you think of what we 'll be seeing one day . To go from movies in black and white to interstellar .

1 ABC is network tv and would have a wider audience

1 The slow pace , the lack of dialogue , the fact that it 's just showing things happening with no context then jumping ahead after . The fact that it ends with a big climax , and the landscape .

1 Thanks . I 'm glad you can adjust your scores , because with 100 different ratings to give a movie , it 's hard to hit the nail on the head on your first go . I like the site !

1 Ed Wood reference

1 ? _ ? You have been sent West .

1 * Century * ? I do n't know about that ...

1 He has a speaking role in Machete Kills .

1 He 's internet famous for AVGN , yet this is the video of his I see most often in the wild

1 his username is 'madeupmoviefact '

1 I was sold the second I saw [ Darren Aronofsky ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0004716 / ) was directing .

1 Amazon.co.uk : Blu-Ray / DVD Combo : * ? 12.97 * DVD : * ? 10.00 * From personal experience , Apple HD Movies are always more expensive than their physical counterparts .

1 Exactly . Whether the decisions they made were right or wrong is of course up for debate , but the crew that worked on these movies is SUUUPER knowledgeable and I doubt any redditor here has really mentioned something ( `` They could 've easily just ... . '' ) that the crew had n't discussed .

1 chaaaaapstick

1 You 're crazy

1 its like watching Sam Raimi try to eat a footlong sub without swallowing

1 Work for penis *

1 oh here , have my upvote

1 * 25th hour * is easily one of Spike Lee 's best movies . behind * Do The Right Thing * , of course .

1 Going for the topical choice I see

1 Calm down , calm down .

1 No , it plays when Optimus Prime has his Big Damn Heroes moment and rolls in to kick some major decpeticon ass . Granted , he dies in the final boss fight of that battle , but everything leading up to that is awesome , he 's just straight up running fools over .

1 It 's miss instead of love ... but yeah Also interesting to look at that song now that Ben Affleck got his shit together and is a huge name director

1 I personally enjoyed Spirited Away more , but to each their own .

1 When I first saw the Star Trek trailer , I was so pissed it showed the name of the guy Benedict Cumberbatch was playing [ ] ( # s `` because I thought for sure it was going to end up being Khan , and because now the surprise of who he was was ruined . Thank fucking goodness they did that because I was even more surprised . '' )

1 G.I Joe : Retaliation

1 Yes .

1 I also thought his whole pedo scandal was discrete marketing haha

1 not at all . just bored

1 Especially noticeable now that I 'm an adult and occasionally rewatch older flicks from when I was 9 or 10 . As much as I wish Eliza Dushku went to high school with me ( e.g. the New Guy ) , there 's no way ... : (

1 Nothing , you say ? What about ... . TWO Bill Bixbys ?

1 Thank you : )

1 Seriously ? Come on , the guy just died .

1 Do n't worry , he 's bright and acts older than he is .

1 Fads do n't last 13 year unaffected .

1 Nolan said that he added the eight year time difference to give Batman 's sacrifice meaning ; that is , during these eight years , Gotham has come to find peace . I do n't think this speculation has much bearing in light of the prologue .

1 I 'm certainly not a doctor and I do n't know everything . I just know the facts available to me and can use reason to piece together what likely happened .

1 > I see a lot of people saying he does n't get the credit he deserves I guess you could argue that the average moviegoer has no idea the effort guys like this go to for the simplest of scenes .

1 > The Tree of Life Had to walk out of that one . Did it ever get ... less boring ?

1 I could n't finish it , nice job .

1 > Hollywood is ~~silently~~ blatantly taking all my money this year . FTFY

1 I could think of plenty of ideas that would be worse . This is n't even comparable .

1 Mulholland Drive is one the easier and more accessible films in my opinion . Despite it 's weird surreal moments , it does tell a cohesive story .

1 Ugh . You know they 'll just serve to teach the ice princess science lady how to value human life . And perhaps how to love .

1 Heh .

1 There is always some putz that says they knew what the ending was going to be .

1 No , it 's still mostly kids , you 're just 30 now so you do n't know that .

1 Blade Runner 's soundtrack is an excellent compliment to its visuals . It was also inventive and futuristic , and highly effective .

1 There are a lot of smaller ones mixed in too . One that I did n't notice until watching them all in order is Stanley 's Pizza . It 's what 's written on the box of the `` east coast '' pizza that Stane brings over to Tony 's place after the board meeting -- then ends up being the same restaurant that Banner 's friend owns in Incredible Hulk .

1 I ca n't believe we Melvined death !

1 Believe what you will , I do n't give a shit . I 'm not used to trust a source like IMDB blindly . For example , this http : / lotr.wikia.com / wiki / The_Hobbit : _The_Battle_of_the_Five_Armies states that it runs 156 minutes . And which resource to trust ?

1 Marc Webb was affected by just as much Sony bullshit as Raimi was . Difference is , Raimi was a much larger figure whilst Webb was more of a yes man for Sony , although I do think if they did n't meddle he would 've made some great Spidey films .

1 How Interstellar Got Her Groove Back

1 Looks like a Lumia !

1 Where do I sign up ?

1 Mmh no sorry , worst movie for me goes to TDKR . It was nonsense all the way . So disappointing , after the previous title .

1 More like `` I did n't see Interstellar and have no strong feelings one way or another '' , * amirite * ? Guys ? G ... guys ?

1 We saved ~~Boston~~ John Connor !

1 Technically , you did not misquote . You did everything by the book . Good job . But you still handpicked the quote to sacrifice accuracy for brevity . I 'm not saying you changed the meaning , but it 's not what he tweeted . The only words from the original quote are `` black community '' and `` wo n't approve '' .

1 Oooh Cigarette Burns is IMO one of his best works , amazing atmosphere , great story and acting . Ok , you made me watch this again like right fucking now .

1 God that would have sucked .

1 That 's Cuntster , a cunt that cunts about like he 's King Cunt of Cunt mountain . The cuntiest cunt to ever cunt , now with 15 % more cunt ! Use as directed .

1 why does it matter if it revolves around his height if its in the vain of bad santa it may be about a man struggling with identity and most likely self-depreciating humor will ensue . hes not playing a leprechaun hes playing a man who tells people hes a leprechaun . any role he take will involve him being a dwarf

1 25 year old women who gets far too emotionally invested in anything to do with Avatar ... I cried watching the recent episode of Legend of Korra , just seeing Aang be all Avatary again . I got so nostalgic . I love the Gaang : ' (

1 Upvote for honesty regarding your terrible opinions .

1 The end of the TV series was just a small portion of the Mangas story . The movie series seems to aim to sum it all up a bit quicker . But even the manga is yet to be finished , the sole guy ( I forget his name ) really takes his time on it . As for the movies [ only the Golden Age has been covered ] ( https : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Berserk : _The_Golden_Age_Arc ) , basically three films that encompass ' a touch more than the old TV series . I do n't know if the name of next `` Age '' has been revealed , and I ca n't remember what it would have been called in the Manga . What I do know , is that they are working on it ; how far they go ... well that 's money talk .

1 You taste like sunshine dust !

1 The character in Inception is n't afraid of water .

1 If you have ever lived in Idaho , it captures that experience pretty well -- a reason I found it charming

1 To be fair , he * was * some seriously hot shit . Some of the hottest shit . Molten shit . Maybe it 's because I never really bought the Red Ranger as a real leader . Is it the actor 's fault ? The writers ? Who knows . I was also one of those kids who thought Cyclops was an asshole . Maybe that 's just a pattern for me , but I obviously was n't the only one .

1 So which comment is the 1994 indie gem `` The Interstellar ( 1994 ) '' ? ( Hint : it 's this one )

1 I disliked the Artist as well . I thought the second act was incredibly poorly paced , and it basically had the same climax twice in a row .

1 That movie was really the moment where I went , `` Holy shit , who is this guy ? '' He acts circles around Crowe and Bale .

1 Well , Variety is a film industry rag . This is pretty much what they are going to write about and how they are going to do it .

1 The Coca Cola scene in `` The Road '' really made me think of how delicious coke must be if you have n't tasted anything good and sweet in years..

1 Someone else already pointed out it 's Scott Park : http : / scottpark.carbonmade.com

1 Nice try ... Church of Scientology .

1 crack is a hell of a drug

1 They are amazing films . Few dollors more has the best climax that I have seen in any movie .

1 Do people really forget West Side Story is Romeo and Juliet ? I think basically everyone knows that . Excellent choice , though .

1 True , it 's a [ terrifying thought ] ( http : / img0.svcdn.lasvegas.com / v2 / cache / lasvegas / 473287236EC53A54FF84DCF5174F7D77.jpg ) .

1 God was that movie awful .

1 He 's not a bad actor . He played a good Peter Parker but his Spider-Man was n't great at all .

1 * triggered *

1 It 's as solidly crafted and meaningful as * All The President 's Men * . Fuck Sorkinland dialogue . This is how you attack real subjects with some muscular and emotional language . Mann 's co-writer , Eric `` Benjamin Button '' Roth , tends to suck sap when he works with other directors ; but in this movie he was right on point .

1 Lucas syndrome . Amazing until he had free reign .

1 I 'm sorry this upset you . Please do n't let that joke affect you or make you feel 'wrong ' in any way . In less than a decade , trans people will be just as accepted and celebrated in popular culture as gay people are today : ) You are just 'right ' , I promise .

1 nah , just stuff from the lotr appendicies .

1 It got a lot of credit for being effective on a low budget. , though . Unfortunately , this started a trend in horror movies of intentionally using a low budget and not really focusing on making a good movie .

1 Excellent ! I never knew she had such nice breasts .

1 it 's the ghost from three men and a baby

1 Re-editing Star Wars ? They 'd * never * do that .

1 What are some satire films you would recommend ?

1 This generation 's Sidney Poitier is Neil Patrick Harris .

1 Fascist .

1 Wilderness Explorer . ( Pixar 's much too smart to endorse the Boy Scouts , although they used a real ice cream shop for where they went for ice cream afterwards . )

1 `` It 's true , this cast has no penis ''

1 Was * Kings of Summer * popular among that age bracket , though ? I do n't know the stats , but I ca n't help but feel it 's more of an artsy movie that only frequent film goers would really jump all over .

1 The soundtrack for this movie is just killer , but John Legend 's is the best .

1 [ Imgur ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / rK4nLfe.jpg )

1 And yet you still found time to comment .

1 Wait , he has wheels ? I thought he has some kinda magic jetpack thing .

1 Yeah , rape 's hilarious : /

1 I like Efman 's response , but did n't feel like he went far enough . Any medium that permits creative expression has the potential to be art . Ebert 's declaration is very provocative . Perhaps one is never too old to morph into a shock jock .

1 I have a strong suspicion you 're not [ SintyGypsy ] ( http : / sintygypsy.deviantart.com / )

1 I can hear the kids in the cafeteria now ... `` dick , dick , dick ''

1 Saw the original , and this Hollywood version . My take , the original is a compelling story . The remake tries to make the story more ... ... . US friendly . This is unfortunate , the original works for two reasons . 1 . I have no idea how Korean society work , so this may be what happens day to day . My day to day does not include what is woven in the story . But I know the US , and this is a stretch . 2 . There is no Tropes , nothing has any resonance with me . The remake , it 's redone for what the production company KNOWS we want . Which is always wrong , producers see movies as a business , not as art . ( Always an exception ) Unfortunately , that puts it into a American frame which I grew up in . So no , that 's not possible for me do loose myself in disbelief . This is the main problem with remakes of Asian films to the American market . The disbelief of another culture gets removed . Lets take horror . A. Japan , shit is happening off screen , you react to the characters reactions . The hook is , my mind creates what is off stage . B. Korea . This is interesting . Here is the Horror , the antagonist , the monster . RUUUUUUUUNNNNNN ! ! ! ! See the Host . Korea puts the horror in front of you , and your are now one of the hunted . American horror . Can we add more blood . Anyone , more blood . Old boy . In the Korean version , you are running for your life , get me home . In the American version ... ... ... . How much action / blood do we need ?

1 Bardem looks like the best thing in it . Sean Penn is a cunt and not a box office draw so I predict a flop .

1 Referencing something does not make you smart .

1 You 're right on that one

1 The Kingdom was Americanized schlock about terrorism in the Middle East that capitalized on the zeitgeist at the time . About the only thing it had going for it was intense action sequences .

1 Hit it again .

1 Because the distributors , the Weinstein company , and any international distributors , do n't work for free . Anyone who actually wants to see it will see it , via HBO or elsewhere .

1 He really brings Cap to life . That character could just be so corny and terrible in the wrong hands . Evans fucking exudes badassness while being sincere , funny , a bit clueless , and heroic

1 I hope his Batman voice is n't as gruff as Bale 's . I really hope they can master that properly .

1 The soundtrack as well .

1 Every time I watch Boogie Nights , I still ca n't believe it 's only his second movie .

1 Whattt . Rush Hour is awesome . Go finish it !

1 Norman Bates : Yelp and Reddit should be SHUT DOWN ! ! ! !

1 No it 's not lazy . One boss ca n't do the job of every single one of his employees . It 's literally impossible . Delegation is essential .

1 You 're that guy who yells at parents for letting their 6 year old girl run around without a shirt on , are n't you ?

1 I wonder who the first 14 were ... .

1 You had no point . You compared random trivia about the comedians to their gender , which is easily discernible in comparison . The height thing is relevant I suppose , but it 's hard to judge that when they 're alone on the stage . And his joke sailed right by yours .

1 Ironically the movie actually seemed to encourage kids to invent new things with the LEGOs they already have , rather than go buy sets that tell you what to do .

1 Prometheus .

1 Imagine they did that , they took the budget if one of these crap fests and gave it to say 3 indie filmmakers , along with 10 days of Liam Neeson each . What would come out of that could be so interesting , something that was art , not just a shoddy cash grab .

1 Let 's not attack Snyder for always being drab . * 300 * is not drab at all .

1 Heat is probably the most realistic gun-fight action scene off the top of my head .

1 Bless you . I did n't know this was a thing .

1 Reynolds was great as Wade Wilson . He is perfect for that role .

1 They were panoramic shots made by the artists in the real NYC , the silver balls were dropped into places they have been made .

1 slut

1 Which one was stunning ? And which one was clever ? They were all pretty literal ... and bad .

1 They also kidnapped it twice

1 To each their own . I did n't find anything to be worth my time . I 'm all for pushing boundaries , I 'm all for showing things in art that nobody has ever shown before , but this came off like someone being shocking just for the sake of shocking someone.That 's empty . Shock me . Disgust me . But have something behind it that makes me glad I saw your film .

1 Say hello to your mother Earth for me .

1 Has anyone ever said that it was bad ? If no , then it ca n't be underrated .

1 That 's not that bad , I think . You got ta downshift for turns and then upshift again after .

1 I agree but for different reasons . The general consensus before the movie premiered was that it would n't be as good as TDK ( without anyone seeing it ) and most people went in the theater thinking that . You have that thought in your mind the entire movie and after the end , most people ( general consensus ) are going to say it was n't as good as TDK . I guess what I 'm saying is that not many people are going to give it a chance without any preconceived notations .

1 Not that it 's even comparable to the motion capture in these movies , but that makeup in the Tim Burton film still blows me away . I was always really impressed by it . Film is n't great but the apes looked terrific .

1 Yes ! ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=BHyl-_CMykU )

1 I was almost so happy to finally start using a legal service . Fucking god damn it , yarg matey ! TO THE SHIP !

1 Truth ! That piece has come on a songza classical station before and it was just too creepy ( thinking of the movie ) .

1 Love this movie . Very memorable characters and great performances from non-actors . Morris Day was hilarious and 'stole ' all of his scenes , like Jack Nicholson in Batman ( he 's not the lead but you wish he was ) . Also , pay attention to the brilliant technical proficiency on display in the way Purple Rain is edited . It crosses the line between narrative film and concert movie seamlessly and influenced the way live performances were covered and cut for years afterwards .

1 Great series , would recommend to everyone . I would n't necessarily call him good at the start of the series . Sort of goes from lawful neutral / evil to chaotic evil .

1 Yeah he is , that 's why I put `` Not the Cab Ride '' in parentheses . I did n't forget it .

1 Are you okay ?

1 My cousin and I said `` Show 's ovah , '' to each other for years after watching this .

1 Good one ! I do n't know that such a realistic choking scene has ever been so gratifying .

1 I 'm so happy he is in so many movies these days , I absolutely love him !

1 How old are you , child ?

1 I know ... I 'm saying it 's the same in the American version . `` Unfortunately fragment with dildo in the American version was not so cool as in the original , so there was nothing to cut ''

1 > `` Kind of early on , Joaquin let me know that actually his shoulder ? I think from birth , he has kind of a messy shoulder .

1 This is my problem too . I ca n't see being that invested in watching an 1.5+ hour movie featuring Black Widow . I like her in the same type of role as she was featured in Cap 2 . Frankly I hope they continue that model where they have a main character then feature a side character along with it .

1 The sound effects and the slinky bullet trails were the cherry on top . Very cool .

1 Abu

1 Also , * Dark City *

1 > I doubt it 's the worst as from the trailers it appeared competently made with decent effects . One could say that about most any film made in Hollywood by a major studio these days . Everything is very paint by numbers , fill in the blank generic crap . Sturgeon 's Law ( 90 % of everything is shit ) is definitely not wrong about movies and never has been . I remember the Rifftrax gang saying in an interview that Twilight was a competently made movie by people who knew what they were doing but even Lionsgate was aware it was a steaming pile of horseshit . There was jut a lot of money in that horseshit . You so rarely see a Manos type film these days because that sort of stuff goes directly to YouTube and gets ten views . Only very rarely these days does a Birdemic come out that is n't self aware parody . The days of the drive-in and mom and pop video store rentals are long gone so I 'd argue there is a lot less experimentation making its way into the commercial world .

1 I guess . I have no idea about the book-version of the character , but the movie Bourne gets , what , two girls ? In the course of three movies ? And I think he only does one of them , and they 're clearly in an actual relationship . James Bond has sex with an average of three to four women per movie . And there 's been 23 movies . You do the math .

1 Do n't all of the really great villains have superb swagger , though ?

1 The Good Dinosaur ? s original director , Bob Peterson , was removed from the project in August , 2013 . A month later , the film was pushed back from its original release date of May 30 , 2014 , to Nov . 25 , 2015 . Since then , the story has been `` carved up and portioned out '' to `` a team of people including Pixar Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter , Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich , Brave director Mark Andrews and the film ? s original co-director , Peter Sohn . '' ( Source : http : / www.latimes.com / entertainment / movies / moviesnow / la-et-mn-pixar-good-dinosaur-pushed-to-2015-20130918,0,1607398.story ) Honestly , I think we 'll hear about another delay or two before the film is finally released . : (

1 Because Rosebud was what he was holding when he was a child and was sent to live with that rich guy - the precise moment his life changed . It represented the destruction of his innocence .

1 Both were in the the biggest blockbusters of '10 and '12 , that 's * A LOT * of damn credit .

1 True BUT Whedon is the reason everyone is going to be coming back to see Avengers 2 . If the first one blew everyone might stick around for their favorite movie in the series but the emotional investment in seeing the characters team up again would be wildly deflated .

1 I concur . The book is also amazing .

1 Thboring ? That is a * horrible * made up word , and I refuse to read the link just because of it .

1 Amazon on demand is close .

1 Aubrey Plaza in a lot of things really .

1 Say what you will about Memevember , but we got two pre 1960 's movies to the front page of reddit with that tactic . And if you ask me that 's kind of cool .

1 I think I may love you for this .

1 He was talking with us here yesterday .

1 Jeeves and Wooster 'n all : D

1 That could probably pass as Zooey 's Russian stunt double though , maybe that 's who Seth Rogan meant lol .

1 or purposely satirical .

1 `` Hey ! Hitler did n't get turned into Hamburger Helper ! ''

1 `` Here 's some perfume samples ... wait , do we have a full size one ? '' That is the reaction of someone who is genuinely caring to the core .

1 You could even have make a double bill with Requiem for a dream , if you really want to lift your spirits .

1 My deepest apologies . whalesteak is just such a popular name , and people of course apply it to their male and female children , and well , I did my best . Please do n't swim over here and kill me or nothin .

1 A while back a redditor posted this this to /r/atheism ( from memory ) : > I am no professional quote maker but here goes > '' In this moment , I am euphoric . Not because of any phony god 's blessing , but because I am enlightened by my own intelligence . '' He got a lot of negative attention for that because of his presumptuous tone . It soon became a meme . So now the term `` euphoric '' is used to poke fun at the cliches in Reddit , especially when it 's a direct appeal to Reddit 's base made to look like an unpopular opinion . Or someone can be called `` euphoric '' if they are attempting to seem intellectual but instead come off as shallow and pedantic ( DAE reference ) . Popular jokes include anything that involves : Bill Nye , Carl Sagan , Neil Degrasse Tyson , Keanu Reeves , Breaking Bad , fedoras , etc ... Edit : dumb phone , wording

1 > Just saw Batman Begins again

1 I do n't like your comment , you used the letter `` w '' twice . I will however upvote it in exactly 6 minutes and 44 seconds .

1 Also - it is the first edition and Disneys first major project with this . So I think it looks mind blowing now and I ca n't wait to see them fix any of the issues and quirks now that they 've finished Frozen .

1 > And yet , just because the priggish Mr. Farber criticizes a movie in the movie ( and , implicitly , the one we 're watching as well ) for its endlessly belabored exposition , a lazy reliance on flat clich ? s , and for forcing characters to go around spewing their innermost thoughts in pedestrian dialog , that does n't pardon `` Lady in the Water '' for blatantly committing every one of these amateurish blunders . On a deeper level ( something Shyamalan 's characters like to talk about , even though he has n't bothered to create one for them , or us ) , Mr. Farber also epitomizes the movie 's oppressive strategy of self-reflexive `` comic relief '' -- an approach that only highlights Shyamalan 's disastrous failure of nerve . Because ( the critic said ) it 's precisely the writer-director 's refusal to commit to his own material that sinks the whole picture . http : / www.rogerebert.com / reviews / lady-in-the-water-2006 `` He can not possibly have written a movie this stupid ...

1 Tom Hanks mentions typewriters .

1 Tarantino makes some great use of music . For me , it 's * Kill Bill * that really does it since it matches the action so well .

1 All they had to do was combine Event horizon with a dash of Aliens and Starship Troopers . But they failed and made it RESIDENT EVIL IN SPACE ! !

1 Go to the theaters alone . Get over that taboo that 's making you miss out on movies because your friends do n't think it 's cool . I mean . You would n't be missing much by not seeing Jupiter Ascending in theaters , but what if next time they do n't want to see a movie that supposed to be good ?

1 Both completely different films but both a masterpiece IMO .

1 I agree but still like Denzel a lot , I think a lot of mainstream actors are successful because overall they 're consistently like able and / or interesting and comfortable in front of a camera . True actors are few and far between on screen in Hollywood .

1 28 Fortnights Later ( Nothing like wedging in a pre-sequel to soak up as much money as possible )

1 and The Dilemma

1 Do n't forget about Atonement , which is n't 100 % about romance , but it 's mostly about it .

1 Frog-DNA can easily be used as an explanation .

1 Everywhere .

1 I 'd download the movie only to see the 15 second section where Sarah Silverman is naked to fap . If you know what I mean .

1 Looks interesting . Too bad ... as someone who 's highly susceptible to motion sickness , I ca n't really enjoy it .

1 I think that other guy hit his nuts .

1 I thought the sexual tension between Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson leapt off the screen

1 Did you see that Eastwood movie where he was cantankerous ?

1 As much as I 'd love a Metroid movie , Samus has never been given enough personality . Unless you count Other M which I hope no Metroid fan would do . Master Chief has a bit more to to work with . Especially his relationship with Cortana .

1 The movie is called `` This Film is Not Yet Rated '' and it 's definitely worth a watch . I also watched it on Netflix but I think it got taken off .

1 This is Reddit , where the downvote button replaces intelligent debate . what did you expect .

1 Forget to take your meds today ?

1 To be fair , Peter Parker is a skinny kid who 's into photography and science . That was basically his defining feature before he was bit by a spider .

1 ssssshhh , he prefers [ Figwit ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Figwit ) .

1 Have you seen the re-scored version , that is fucking hard to take .

1 I 'm pretty sure the main reason Ryan Reynolds is the main choice by many to portray Deadpool is because Deadpool once stated he looks like Ryan Reynolds . Well , Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei .

1 Yeah , that 's what I meant . : ) That `` The Boy Who Lived '' always makes you think of `` Oh , I get it , he should have died against Voldemort as a baby but lived . '' But if he died and she kept the title , then it becomes much more poignant : `` The boy who lived [ for a short while ] . '' Ah , wasted potential . But haha , me too , just scrolling through this discussion is filling me with ideas and debate stuff for this wonderful story !

1 I actually really liked that movie and the terrible reviews make me sad . I thought it was interesting how it changed genre partway through the movie . I was a teenager when I first saw it though and have n't watched it again in quite a while . I should give it another watch and see if i still feel the same .

1 I also really enjoyed the first robbery scene from the car 's perspective

1 I do n't believe you .

1 hahah what ? !

1 There 's no way Inception or Interstellar would have been made unless The Dark Knight Trilogy was successful . Whatever WB offered Affleck , I bet it 's pretty good .

1 You seem to be missing some dots . Here , let me help you : L ? t den r ? tte komma in . : )

1 All of his videos are extremely informative .

1 Actually I 'd argue they 're both about the emptiness and placement of modern man in society . Just to be clear : does n't mean I do n't love FIGHT CLUB too . I do . Its hugely entertaining and smartly made . It does n't have to be hugely deep to be worthwhile .

1 Some of us already are . \ # illuminati

1 Anyone who thinks we did n't evolve from apes should watch that video .

1 That 's my point . Bad wording I guess .

1 Would have been better as an X-Files episode .

1 Chaos Theory .

1 You 're trolling so hard . So so hard . No valid points . If you actually watched the movies you 'd see you learn amazing lessons from it . Not gon na try to explain to you . Go back into your hole troll lol .

1 DEFCON 1000000- Super-Ultra-Mega Peace . No weapons exist anywhere in the universe and all neighboring dimensions and nobody is harboring any violent feelings against anyone or anything else .

1 `` GALVATRON . '' `` HAIL GALVATRON ! ''

1 This comment makes me sad . : (

1 I saw Bronson recently . Amazing work . Great soundtrack .

1 Math is a bitch .

1 Fuck it , why not .

1 Yeah , I know what you mean , although it 's essentially implied that the struggle of fighting Destoroyah leads to Godzilla 's death / hastens the meltdown . Which is like a roundabout way of him `` killing '' Godzilla , I suppose .

1 Best : 1 . Grand Budapest Hotel ( The first Wes Anderson movie that I absolutely loved ) 2 . Captain America : The Winter Soldier ( Probably my favorite Marvel movie so far ) 3 . Under the Skin ( There 's simply nothing else like it out in theaters right now ) 4 . The Lego Movie ( I 'm less enamored with this one than everyone else , but it 's still a funny and wildly entertaining ride nonetheless ) 5 . Noah ( An intriguing , if messy , take on a story that 's been done a million times before ) Worst : 1 . 300 : Rise of an Empire ( The original , while dumb and cheesy as hell , was entertaining and visually stunning enough to warrant a recommendation . The sequel , except for Eva Green 's completely insane performance , has none of that . It even looks terrible . ) 2 . A Winter 's Tale ( It only avoids being # 1 because it 's so unique and interestingly awful . ) 3 . Need for Speed ( Complete miscasting of the lead role . Aaron Paul is a damn good actor , but an action star he is not . ) 4 . Pompeii ( It 's just Titanic but with a volcano instead of an iceberg ) 5 . Transcendence ( I 'm not mad at this movie , I 'm just disappointed ) Edit : reasons

1 Personally , I think it 's the best and most ambitious of the three .

1 I 'm still amazed that he actually got paid for that .

1 [ 1988 The Blob ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / The_Blob_\ ( 1988_film\ ) )

1 Nah , I get it in this case . Most HP fans adore the 3rd movie , which was the first to really deviate from the books iirc . Cuaron made it more visually exciting and action packed without altering the characters ' motivations and personalities . He left in the stuff that the readers loved , took out boring stuff no one cared about , and added cool stuff that enhanced the story . Yates ' changes did nothing to add to / shorten / simplify / enhance the film and got rid of some of the truly magic moments that book fans loved . Certain things should absolutely not be trifled with when adapting a book to the big screen , like deaths , victories and first kisses . Among other things , Yates fucked with not one but both of the highly anticipated first kiss scenes from the series . I 'm sure he had his reasons ( Harry and Ginny 's is too similar to Ron and Lavender 's ; Ron and Hermione 's is almost an afterthought ) , but still . There are certain moments you do n't deny readers , and part of a good director 's job is recognizing those moments and remaining faithful to them . The book R / H kiss occurred at a completely inopportune moment and in front of Harry , who deadpans `` Is this the moment ? Oi , there 's a war going on here ! '' It was absolutely brilliant as it mimicked the thoughts of every reader who 'd watched those two idiots spend the past 3 books bungling up every proper romantic opportunity that came their way . A great laugh out loud moment in the middle of an otherwise dark chapter , and there was no reason why it had to be left out , yet Yates turned it into a very cliche `` Oh , we 've survived a scary moment together , let 's make out '' scene .

1 lol a shit actor ? you are a shit critic ...

1 It 's different from the Illiad , but the Illiad is n't the only telling of the story of the war against Troy

1 Same here , Nolan makes spectacular movies . But when you look through the bombastic spectacle of this movie a lot of things just fall flat .

1 Well they say write what you know ... edit : I 'm a huge Woody Allen fan , for what it 's worth .

1 But GTA V was also about 3-6 times more expensive ( Tickets can go up to $ 20 ) .

1 Rim Drive . X-Rated , naturally .

1 Seconded . The best ensemble motion picture I 've ever seen

1 In that case , I do n't want another south park movie

1 At this point , unless I hear great things from a lot of people I trust , I just ignore M. Night Shyamalan .

1 Fantastic actor but I totally agree .

1 I do n't think he dramatically takes of his reading glasses enough in this video .

1 That 's why I liked Fight Club . Shit got fucked .

1 > why is JGL hanging out a farm ? > what movie did I go see ? > JGL on a farm ? ?

1 People are shitheads . I ca n't understand why someone would down vote you just for stating an opinion that is relevant to the OP . You think Rooney Mara is just as beautiful if not more beautiful than Scarlett Johansson . Anybody who said something similar got down voted immediately . I think there are some mouth breathing stalker ScoJo fans running around here .

1 The 2nd and 3rd books read this way too . I read all 3 books back to back I watched all 3 movies back to back . Same effect both times . It seems like 2 separate novels in the same universe .

1 lol , / u / atticus_finch_

1 You mean , other than the fact that it is R2D2 's head / dome ?

1 That second clip was so trippy : a cell phone video , in a movie , someone filming it on a TV , uploaded to Youtube , on my computer screen .

1 Tarantino , scorsese , malick , gunn , linklater , wes anderson

1 Molecular biology has super little to do with how big he is on a macro scale . Come on man . Because you have a molec degree does n't make you more knowledgable about working out than people who work out .

1 Penguins walk in , they walk out . You ca n't explain that .

1 * Jean-Luc Godard

1 I keep seeing this but has there really been * that * much given away ? I mean I know they 've already revealed the I-Rex getting loose and all the visitors being attacked , but all in all we 've seen about maybe ten minutes of footage from a two-hour film . There are a lot of plot speculations / rumors floating about /r/JurassicPark that the trailers / clips have n't even touched on .

1 There 's really no way to read that line and not sound like an emotional 7th grader , even when you 're Natalie Portman . Shoddy writing is shoddy writing .

1 Seems more like a Star Trek situation where most people who outright hate it hate it because it 's different .

1 Idina Menzel will always be Maureen Johnson scream-singing Over The Moon , to me . And that 's not a bad thing ... But there is a distinctly NEW YORK quality to her voice that I only realized existed once I moved away from NY and heard people from other states talking more often , haha .

1 Indeed . The thrumming as he 's pacing his office on the phone with Hoffman . Upvote .

1 Probably because it mostly has n't happened yet and he has only announced his intention to donate most or all of the 4.05 billion dollars he is getting from the sale of Star Wars . The recipients of the money have n't been chosen yet . Sorry for the terrible website but it 's a reliable source : http : / www.hollywoodreporter.com / news / disney-deal-george-lucas-will-384947 Then I searched `` George Lucas donation '' and nothing about education has been mentioned since , though he has made large donations in the meantime ( $ 25M to University of Chicago and $ 500K to Norman Rockwell Museum , for example ) .

1 We do n't want you to use free speech to make a joke about free speech ! Suppress him !

1 This shot is in all likelihood a guy in a costume . They do n't use CG for a simple shot like this . The colors have been played with and I 'm sure the image was touched up , but this is not CG .

1 Coriol what ?

1 Being in my family was horror enough .

1 Some day you 'll open up . [ Some day . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=goy5HAn57-E )

1 I 'm surprised someone like you was able to afford tickets to even see the movie . Edit : Haha jk lol sarcasm ! ; )

1 It doubles up as his 'Do not visit ' site list , you see .

1 Yeah Housebound is sweet , surprisingly creepy at times ! Indie horror is easily the place to be for horror . hollywood horror is garbage . Deliver us form Evil , Annabelle are some of the worst movies of the year

1 It 's an expression of the company 's credo , as in `` yeah we make movies cheaper , faster and more disposable , but we 've got -attitude ! kids , attitude ! ''

1 ANTI FREEEEEZE

1 I thought Amu Adams was criminally underused in MoS . She had nothing to do with the story . She just felt like she was there for the sake of being there .

1 Someone call HBO .

1 I think it was a gesture he did and not a punch . Pretty sure he never touched the suit when he did it .

1 This happened with the last Hobbit movie , and it will happen with The Battle of Five Armies . Reddit has a raging biased hardon for The Hobbit and anyone who would criticism the films for obnoxious cgi , poor pacing , and forced filler material get downvoted to oblivion . If it were a struggling indie film I guess I would get it , but c'mon , the first Hobbit movie made over a billion dollars . I love LOTR and consider it the best filmmaking feat of all time , but damn guys let people criticism it for Christ 's sake .

1 I thought Harrison Ford reaching for the napkin was definitely up there , too .

1 Having read the book , some scenes in Gone Girl has less affect due to my expectation . But still that NPH scene .

1 It was inspired by / a homage to the ending in Akira .

1 I would n't mind if they just developed the story better from where it was put in the first 2 films . I read the first book long before a movie was annouced . When I read the book , I knew the book would make an awesome story for the big screen . I tried reading the Hunger Games book before couple years before the film was released and I found it unbareable .

1 Exactly . I keep imagining if everyone were to ask the Academy why it is nominated , their answer would simply be `` Well , you know ... because 9 / 11 . ''

1 That is a way better trailer .

1 Does n't count . Targeted guys from the get-go . Told entirely from guy 's point of view , deals with guy 's misconceptions of romance , etc .

1 I love Alien : Resurrection . Just because no one took it seriously . Including the actors . They seemed like they had too much fun making that . I had fun watching it . Alien 3 was fucken joyless ( the directors cut is far superior ) .

1 Episode I is one of the worst films of all time in my opinion , given a ) its budget , b ) how long Lucas had to write / develop it , c ) the sheer mountains of already-existing stories , not to mention the fact that the original films laid out the galaxy , and d ) the sheer awfulness of the writing , acting , and cgi . It 's unwatchable unless I really want to see how terrible movies can be .

1 `` My God you 've gotten fat . ''

1 This comment is good . It 's Good . It 's GooOODd .

1 Even though I lack the common gene that makes one appreciate the genius of Scott Pilgrim ... I can certainly commiserate with this statement .

1 The Prestige . It better captures the scary but fascinating potential of technology in the early 1900 's . The scene where he is in the theatre and says `` Man 's reach exceeds his imagination . '' is still one of my all time favorite shots .

1 Basic Instinct is fun and she 's there as `` talent '' but her acting in Casino is great .

1 Matchstick Men is fucking awesome . And the ending was a major kick in the balls .

1 3 of them ... Airport , '75 , and '77 it likely would have spoofed '79 Concord if it was n't in production at the same time .

1 They last longer than the modern ones too .

1 That website is beautiful . > Pervert : Grandpa Joe is a lecherous soul who commonly spends his days in bed with two women and another man .

1 Parlay

1 That said , we already know Streep is going to rock this role .

1 Seriously you ca n't make this stuff up .

1 I watched it and got drunk with some buddies . I 'd say I got 9 or 10 actual laughs from it . I probably would n't watch it again but from my experience it was pretty good .

1 Altman does n't get a lot of love at r / movies , so it 's not well known to a lot of the users .

1 Not until they stop raking in the cash on live performances .

1 I want to go more into theater but then i see that the ticket is more than 10 $ ( if you are stupid you will pay more for 3d ) and i will have to suffer with the people talking , using their phone , eating , drinking , kicking the back ... I want to go to a theater to enjoy a movie , not to be in a circus .

1 CIA Superior : What did we learn , Palmer ? CIA Officer : I do n't know , sir . CIA Superior : I do n't fuckin ' know either . I guess we learned not to do it again . CIA Officer : Yes , sir . CIA Superior : I 'm fucked if I know what we did . CIA Officer : Yes , sir , it 's , uh , hard to say CIA Superior : Jesus Fucking Christ .

1 Yes . Have a poptard .

1 Yeah that 's a little loose . I think that the `` shit is gon na hit the fan '' `` storms coming '' is overplayed . When referring to weather , I think that 's quite a bit different .

1 Really ? It was my favorite Bond film

1 There 's also [ Jerry Haleva ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0355062 / ) , who plays nobody but Saddam Hussein across six different movies .

1 He peaked with the 'the big blue ' ; LE GRAND BLEU . Before that , he had some hits called NIKITA and SUBWAY .

1 dale and tucker vs evil is a fucking riot and lots of good gore

1 I like to pretend that 2007 had the same problem as 2001 , not 2006 .

1 In the Remake : Sphinx played by Vinnie Jones .

1 It 's a running gag that Paul Rudd does on Conan . Someone made a [ pretty good compilation ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=6bNzAgJMYVE ) . P.S . it took so much self control not to link to the Mac and Me clip again ...

1 > American moviegoers sent a clear message to Hollywood over the summer : We are tired of more of the same . I do n't see anything `` clear '' about that . It 's also a disingenuous statement , as if next summer will be suddenly blown free & clear of anything `` the same '' , a generalization for sequels & reboots , by nervous studios . As if Hollywood is just holding back a revolutionary new script & production formula that will instantly redefine blockbuster movies to the core , that does n't include re-branding established movies .

1 > Read an article today that Universal wants to try and build a tentpole family of spy characters in the Bourne Universe . Really ? Do you mean the article that we 're all talking about ?

1 That is actually kind of brilliant .

1 Se7en . Really ?

1 You hear that everybody ? This guy wants a TURBOMAN DOLL !

1 I 'm pretty sure only one of them is a woman .

1 She is , umm ... not ugly . ( Jesus Christ she is gorgeous )

1 Cut off for me too unless I full screen the window

1 I had that problem watching [ Freaks ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Freaks ) . It took me way too long to realise there were * two * female characters . Also every military or gangster movie confuses me , because they all have identical outfits . I have [ face blindness ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Face_blindness ) , though . Maybe you do too !

1 Yes > he regularly performs his own stunts I agree with him though . I think the stunt men deserve some recognition .

1 Whoa buddy , Del Toro has some pretty awesome films on his resume . Even if you 're not into his action stuff .

1 No RV : (

1 Different movies but it 's pretty great like the original

1 He 's like a walking spoiler

1 Meh

1 It looks like a super buffed up version of the original . Like Rhyhorn now evolved to Rhydon .

1 Star Wars

1 Seth Rogan said when it came out and ran in LA for months he and James Franco would go and just laugh .

1 There 's always people that have n't been introduced to whatever that is . I sometimes leave that playing for longer than I 'm willing to admit . Happy to help !

1 Well , which one is it ? That 's a pretty crucial conjunction .

1 Same here . Those ghostly alien midgets were terrifying .

1 Of course your character can be younger , but that does n't make it any less fucking stupid . If the actors were all 90 year old geriatrics it would n't be ageism to say they clearly are n't teenagers .

1 Yep the shaun , fuzz and pilgrim ones are great + plus the stuff of on the attack the block dvd is great

1 It was edited for TV . I was listening to James Lipton on MSNBC this morning and he said the actual interview lasted over four hours .

1 I figure he wants to do , but he wants to do it so that it will be remembered . As for saying no it might be one of those events you just ca n't say no to . They exist . Usually an unwritten agreement like `` If you do this , so-and-so will be in your movie . If you do n't do it your next premier will be in Doncastor Odeon . It 's not really a threat just a system of favours . It presented as a threat but it 's really just a system of favours .

1 Fellowship of the Ring

1 That 's no train , it 's a McConaughrail !

1 White man 's burden , Lloyd . White man 's burden .

1 Well , considering what he and George Lucas did to Indiana Jones , I 'd say that 's fairly accurate .

1 Yep , it robs the characters of their personality even more than the art style already does .

1 You ca n't really kill Ultron since he 's an AI program . You destroy his body and he can just build himself a new one later on

1 Awareness is not action .

1 It 's relatively polarizing too , which a lot of now-classics were - A Clockwork Orange , 2001 , etc . It was well filmed , had a simple story on the surface with lots of depth , and great support from Perlman , Cranston and the rest of the cast . Plus it pretty much embodies Gosling 's swagger , he was designed for that role .

1 I say six was just obnoxious . It had some good parts and the end was interesting including Harry using the liquid luck ( I thought Radcliffe actually did the best acting of the series during that ) . Overall it was very mediocre and way too much whining .

1 because this is a couple of years old ?

1 To be fair of the three , terminator is the franchise you can most legitimately reset everything with time travel and start over , since that is the entire premise of the films .

1 At least he wo n't wait twenty years before making a prequel trilogy .

1 Another ? ! You * do * exist . Most underrate movie of that year and I was shocked to feel so alone about it . I thought it was one of the most unique visual-storytelling experiences I 'd ever seen in a big-budget film . The crescendo of storytelling during the races , the faithfulness to the spirit of a kinetic cartoon , and the immersive colors an effects blew me away . I 100 % understand I someone did n't like the film or thought it was going to give them a seizure but I thought it was wonderfully an uniquely told and maybe exsist at the extreme left of a scale that ends with Terrance Malick on the far right ( I 40 % stand by that statement ) .

1 I thought it was the best Marvel movie . But I 've only found Iron Man 1 , Avengers and Captain America 2 are the only good ones . The rest are pretty average .

1 Well , you 're just wrong ...

1 Twister , Gravity , Armageddon , Dante 's Peak , Volcano , The Perfect Storm , Deep Impact , The Day After Tomorrow ( I think ) . A lot of disaster movies use nature as the bad guy .

1 I think it has more to do with the belligerently unnecessary use of nigger . I agree with your point , honestly , that every generation is a reaction to the generation preceeding it . But you did n't have to go using trigger words to prove that there are some things that open-minded people are still intolerant of . Like bigotry .

1 I 'm really surprised I had to come this far down to see this .

1 Put on the glasses !

1 I do n't know , I like Franco but it seems a little weird that they have him playing Hefner , who was then in his mid-40s . Maybe if they 'd aged him , but it did n't look like that in the trailer .

1 > its borderline over-rated here . Nope . It crossed that border quite a while ago .

1 Why would he make that up ? Oh yeah , internet points .

1 He 's clearly talking about in theme , tone and style .

1 Oh , I definitely do n't only watch 'blockbuster ' movies . If I had to estimate , I would say I watch 50-60 % comedies / action movies / blockbusters , and 40-50 % movies with `` heart and soul , '' as you put it .

1 Alright , can I just ask it ... what is so great about Tree of Life ? I felt the entirety of the movie to be very boring and hard to follow . The visuals were beautiful , but beautiful imagery does not make a movie great . I felt as if the entire thing was the director 's homage to his own life , I did not feel connected to the characters at all . I 'm really not trying to be a dick , but honestly why do people like this movie ?

1 Tell that to the guys who made the CGI !

1 But not as Batman .

1 Any Dreamworks Animation poster would be more accurate than Tangled .

1 I actually really enjoyed like the first half of Ghost Rider 2 , then it went downhill . The most disappointing part of the whole movie , though ? Seeing Anthony Stewart Head ( Giles , the Watcher from Buffy ) was in it , getting super excited , and then he 's onscreen for all of like 2 minutes total .

1 This is too small for a full desktop wallpaper -- Gon na have to tile it !

1 Might 've been a joke . I thought of that too haha

1 Did you not watch the first 3 Harry Potter films ?

1 It sounds like you did n't watch the Dark Knight at all then , if that 's how you feel

1 I 'm not saying the movie looks bad per se , the trailer is just very poorly put together .

1 I did not know that . She is 90 , though . ( or 92 , even Wikipedia is not sure )

1 Antje Traue looks the part . She played Faora in MoS . Probably the only character I actually liked in the movie .

1 That 's silly , just watch the movie as intended to be seen .

1 If I had to recommend Deadwood to anyone , I would caution them that while watching each episode , think to yourself `` that was a cool experience , but if there was n't another episode I wo n't be heartbroken . '' The first 35 times , it wo n't be a big deal , but it might take the sting out of that 36 episode . Excellent series whose time was cut too short .

1 Scorcese does not make pretentious movies . If anything you could call him the darker Spielberg , his movies get wide audiences and tell universal stories . Scorsese just tends to have a harder line of content , he revels in sex , violence and drugs .

1 speak for yourself . I always jump at that part

1 This is the problem with Hollywood movies . The formula for a 'moral ' or a happy ending to the story seems embedded into every movie . They create false expectations of what should happen in a movie , that in some way it should provide catharsis . It 's difficult for me to fully enjoy movies like this anymore . I do n't go out my way actively to find movies that challenge me , but in the end , those are the ones that stay with me . I could n't even tell you what The Avengers was about now , exactly , but a movie like Calvary opens up questions that I 'll be answering for a long time .

1 To each their own I guess .

1 I 'm blackanese

1 Clearly you 've never watched LOST .

1 Esplain .

1 having your own beliefs is n't being pretentious asshole .

1 He was talking about Django Unchained , he said this after mentioning the abuse of the main character 's wife .

1 This stuff is sublime , absolutely love it , thanks for being creepy !

1 i am left handed and i used to write this way when younger , the teachers soon beat the devil out of me and now i write an ugle scrawl but the right way round .

1 This reads like a really bad attempt at nonchalant marketing . It probably is . I saw The Darkest Hour last week though , and can weigh in . It 's got some cool points , some neat ideas and a strong opening . It 's not a bad movie , but stunted dialogue and poor performances pop up throughout the film . It 's not enough to ruin the movie , but it does take you out of the moment . Seeing as The Darkest Hour is most definitely a `` survivor '' film , being taken out of the movie and its flow is very detrimental . And the creature design , while innovative and neat theoretically , is poorly executed . It 's got ups and downs , worth a watch on a boring day .

1 Yep , Jon . My bad .

1 That 's interesting . As much as I liked Cabin in the Woods , I do n't think Goddard can save WWZ , since the entire premise shits on the source material , which could have made for a great psuedo-documentary type movie , or anthology TV series . Oh well ...

1 That 's the joke ...

1 What are we , pansy Greeks ? ! We do our shit onstage !

1 The originals do !

1 The greatest film from one of the greatest director of all time . Los Olvidados ... shit man ...

1 Mmm , Ornella Muti . Now I 'm daydreaming about her dressed up like the princess in Flash Gordon .

1 All I remember was a rocket lifting off from a corn field .

1 I would watch absolutely anything if it were directed by Ben Wheatley . I would watch it twice if it also has Brie Larson in it . Big yes from me .

1 I think the pee might go into the chair and it is converted back into those slushees they enjoy so much !

1 Agreed . Since a lot of these movies are n't available for `` Instant '' , it 's more like a list of movies that you might like to see someday , or illegally download .

1 Lux Aeterna is used by inexperienced editors to make common videos `` epic ''

1 source other than your ass ?

1 I like paying for movies I think will be really good movies , where this does n't look like it will fit the bill . Do n't get me wrong ; I 'm sure it will be entertaining as hell in a guilty-pleasure sort of way . Perfect Redbox material .

1 Do krakow057 actually proofreads the titles before he 'destroys ' them ?

1 I think that top one is just his shirt .

1 Yup , you actually understood how a movie works , in which not every character is a good character or is supposed to be a representation for a larger demographic of people .

1 Grave of the Fireflies is a great first date movie .

1 This has been driving me frickin crazy as well . Every single shot is a fade-in fade-out ... * absurd . *

1 I 'd describe it as boring and uninteresting rather than stupid , but either way you 'd be better off not watching it .

1 Nolan has said that he really want 's to do a Bond film , imagine a reboot with a story that tells the origin of Bond played by Fassbender in the 60 : s during the peak of the cold war

1 lady behind me was going `` just keep swimming ... just keep swimming ... go ... go ... '' only not in a sing-song way . more of a panic .

1 Im sorry to you as well .

1 The movie is n't out yet .

1 I will surely look for it in the local movie store .

1 Also see , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 , and 2014 .

1 I think he would have laughed .

1 Hodor ?

1 but they could have used varied actors for the foreground , and replicated these for the background , right ?

1 DAE HATE THE PREQUELS ? !

1 Do n't forget , or miss the original Straw Dogs .

1 Just the creation of the universe and fucking dinosaurs

1 Since he is in the top 10 highest grossing movies stars in history , I 'm going to guess a lot of people watch his movies .

1 Indeed it is . But Ozymandias is the antagonist of the story since he does play opposite the protagonists which most people would view as the `` bad guy . '' The ending is n't forced at all because it was exactly what Ozymandias was plotting throughout the entire movie / graphic novel .

1 I 'd like to see a Kubrick biopic

1 It definitely made him feel more sadistic I 'd say . What 's more crazy than WANTING and TRYING to destroy humanity and being a sarcastic asshole at the same time ?

1 Dave Prowse was a contender ( ca n't remember if he won ) of Britain 's Strongest Man . Also , before he was Vader he was instructing kids on how to cross the road safely as The Green Cross Code Man . Guy is an unappreciated legend .

1 So ... perfect casting for the kid

1 I had no interest in this when it was in the theaters but I just watched it this past weekend and have to say that I was really rather blown away by just how good it was . I thought Andrew Garfield was a great choice and thought he was much better than Tobey McGuire . I 'd even go so far as to say that I might need to add this one to my collection .

1 Pixar used to use proprietary software called 'Marionette ' ( for about 25 years ! ) . They switched over to the new 'Presto ' software during the production of 'Brave ' .

1 Out of Sight

1 Yes ! Definitely one of the most consistent franchises for sure .

1 It 's popular among this subreddit but you might not have seen it . Grand Budapest Hotel . Quirky , funny , and a surprising amount of heart . Bad Words is worth a watch .

1 Most people have no idea of how much history is between Seneca Falls and Waterloo . It really IS a Wonderful Life here . There is always somewhere to go or places to see .

1 You 're a special kind of asshole , are n't you ?

1 why did n't i concur ...

1 WHY IS SHE DRESSED LIKE A BABYSITTER

1 Eh , she 's not that big of a deal . My planes were raining bombs on her while she was still in the Renaissance era . Noob .

1 I really hate that quote , either we all are , or nobody is ( special ) . Which is the same thing , big fucking deal .

1 > there 's a difference between objectively GOOD filmmaking and mediorcre or below filmmaking Which you clearly do n't understand if you call F & F bad . Man , you just need to embarrass yourself over and over ?

1 Movie knocked me over with some of the most touching religious dialogue I 've read in the midst of all the usual Kevin Smith stuff . Rickman was awesome > He begged me to 'make it all not true ' , and let me let you in on something , Bethany , it 's something I 've never told anyone before . If I had the power ... I would have . It 's unfair ! It 's unfair to ask a child to shoulder that responsibility , and it 's unfair to ask you to do the same now . I sympathize , I do- I wish I could take it all back ... but I ca n't . This ... is who you are .

1 I 'll agree here : The Hobbit , the BOOK , was comedic in these scenes . Almost ridiculously so .

1 That line , the bunch of jackasses standing in a circle , and the legend of Footloose all had me in tears

1 Happy cake day ! The Patriot . Now here is one for you to try ! The Patriot .

1 /r/NetflixBestOf

1 There 's no need for an explanation honestly . It 's Mad Max , it 's here , it looked really cool . The shot of them with the crows was beautiful .

1 Not if you count `` the sisters '' .

1 I think they wanted to avoid redundancy because all 7 could be John Williams

1 another reboot ?

1 When you said `` sexiest lines '' I had to pause and wonder if you were n't talking about the sound it made . I 'd actually started to shake my head and continue scrolling when it suddenly occurred to me what you really meant .

1 Try http : / www.youtube.com / user / joblomovienetwork

1 Some people are anal .

1 Yup , the movie looks like perfect fun . Do n't really know what people expect from such a movie .

1 Welcome to comic writing , where continuity is made up and the plots do n't matter .

1 It 's a fucking joke , stop taking it so literally .

1 I would highly suggest watching the movie . It 's great from both a technical stand point , and a story telling stand point . And [ here 's ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=QfBSncUspBk ) the clip , but beware of spoilers .

1 They missed the perfect opportunity to call this movie Kray Kray ...

1 Danny Trejo claiming to be a Muppet is going to give me nightmares .

1 * meet me in Montauk *

1 After listening to the Gardenstate commentary , I 've heard Zach Braff complain about that old bike enough to know that it 's got to be a lot less work to just make an new bike look old than to work with a vintage bike .

1 I think that 's fair . Tit for tat . Or whatever the saying would be .

1 That 's clearly not true from what the last trailer has shown .

1 [ 31 credits , baby ! ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0001740 / ? ref_=nv_sr_1 )

1 Ha , I see what you did there .

1 That as sad but sort of sudden . I guess everyone kind of expected him to die eventually but no one really wanted him to .

1 I will start working on it within the following days : ) .

1 That 's what subsidiaries and the long tail are for . They could make a whole bunch of films under different studio names , give them all limited releases with cheap marketing , and then advertise the hell out of any DVD releases for films that were popular or well-reviewed . Stick 'em on Netflix , Hulu , YouTube , whatever . License them to FX . Whore out the finished product in every possible way for as long as anyone even half-cares , because it costs nothing to support once it 's out of theaters . I do n't know about 100 cheap movies a year - but one $ 8M feature every two weeks could n't be any worse than flushing all the money down the toilet at once on crap like this .

1 Having never watched Phantom ( only heard a few songs ) I find it hard to believe the songs in Les Mis can be matched ! Which only excites me more about eventually seeing it : )

1 Nah , that dude has definitely got a hick-like older american accent . Plus ... grizzly bears . I do n't think grizzly bears are in England . I think .

1 `` I like standing next to you , Shaun . It makes me look so tough . '' Perfect delivery .

1 You ca n't remember when because it did n't happen . Gimmie my $ 50 and do n't be a squelcher .

1 I love Jar Jar walking in the desert in the first shot ! Nothing over the top . Beautiful .

1 [ Discussed elsewhere as false . ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / vp7yd / remember_in_back_to_the_future_where_doc_sets_the / c56f0qb ) And the image in question does n't even get the digits looking right .

1 No kidding . Gummo has to be one of the most fucked-up movies ever made . If anybody is thinking about seeing it - do n't think of this post as a recommendation for a disturbing movie - this is instead a terrible warning .

1 No , * Event Horizon * is the exact opposite of this . It 's one of the clearest examples of the `` me am play gods '' theme : humans muck around where they should n't , and end up facing horrible consequences .

1 Nah , I meant 'verbose ' alright , though 'comprehensive ' is true , too . See [ / u / theoriginalaks 's comment ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / 1tm5ni / the_original_rancor_costume_for_return_of_the / ce9k88m ) for an example ; it 's an * 8 page story * about a side character that only appears once in a single scene in the whole film ! It 's a pretty good story , though .

1 could n't agree more . Never seen a superhero movie do that before where the hero is terrified by his powers as he begins to discover them

1 Same , didnt expect much but got blown away at the end by the awesomeness of it .

1 And yet very gentle and soothing .

1 I think you 're forgetting what [ Leonardo DiCaprio looked like in 1998 ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / hhInm.jpg ) .

1 That 's my take too . It was corny as hell , I laughed during the 'serious dialogue , ' and I could n't get over the Colonel looking too much like Duke Nukem ( has Cameron been sued for * that * yet , I wonder ? ) , but the visuals were incredible .

1 > I did n't read all the books and did n't read the ending Get the fuck out of this Harry Potter discussion

1 See nobody cares , nice hat . What are you trying to look like , a secret agent ?

1 That would be what the critic awards are . You 're covered .

1 Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill were both in James Franco ? I believe it .

1 Picture quality may actually be better at your house depending on setup at the theater . Depending on theater size , the physical size of the screen is negated by the distance you are from it . You really miss out on sound quality and volume . Theater sound is way better than nearly anything I 've ever heard in a house . Not to say there arent some great setups out there , but they are just not attainable due to cost for the average home theater . Your surround sound just wont cut it . For some films , like comedies , you also miss out on the community experience of watching it . I.E the laughter of the entire audience . It does add to it when laughing with a group .

1 I never liked Donnie Darko , it always was angsty emo teen masturbatory material to me . No thanks .

1 Tarantino too . If you can make a short film good enough , people will give you grants and financing . PTA , Neil Bloomkamp , Wes Anderson , Sean Durkin , and Dan Trachtenbergall all started with a short film . Other people beg and scrounge enough to start with a film and make it from there . That 's what Tarantino did , Sam Raimi , Kevin Smith , Shane Caruth , and quite a few others . Or go with commercials and music videos like : Spike Jonez , Doug Liman , David Fincher , Marc Webb , Michel Gondry , and Gore Verbinski . And know people ! Did you know James Cameron and Sam Raimi lived in the same town and made 8mm films together ? Did you know that Wes Anderson and Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage AND Sofia Coppola are all cousins ? Guess who ties them together , Francis Ford Coppola ! ! ! You know who Emilio Esteves ' Dad is ? Martin Sheen . You know Angelina Jolie 's Dad right ? John Voight . Make a short or a feature and submit it to everything you can . At the very least , you 'll meet someone who wants to work with you and that can go a long way . Luc Besson has worked with the same exact team of people on nearly EVERY single film . PTA has used the same DP on every film but the Master . When you find something good , hold on . Your trick is to become that good . Sometimes , you got ta suck it up and take the bad job and save money for the passion project . I forget who , but one director made kids shows for PBS until he made his first film . Tarantino worked at a video rental store ; I think Kevin Smith did too . Just keep trying .

1 Also if you do n't mind English subtitles ... the original Old Boy .

1 What an incredible film . That movie actually left me and my buddy speechless when we first saw it . Walked out of the theater and 10+ minutes to get home without saying more than a word or two the whole way .

1 In my opinion it was obviously satire . I mean 100 % , in your face , you have to be blind to miss it satire . The fascistic overtones were n't subtle in the slightest . It was n't comedic , but that 's not really relevant .

1 Yeah , it 's a real shame he was n't nominated for an Emmy .

1 Well , the nice thing about opinions are that they vary . Now we know yours .

1 Odd that although when a movie `` bombs '' in the US , it 's a failure , but a smashing success is called a `` Blockbuster '' , referencing bombs in WWII that could level a city block . Us Americans sure are consistent , yes sir .

1 Clicked on this thread just to see if anyone mentioned this movie .

1 Unless you have fire .

1 Actual torture scenes always get to me a lot more than the horror movie stuff .

1 I agree , but unfortunately they 've made a date with the public on the 20th .

1 Seriously , I bet some writers had a blast . It was so tropey that I loved it . 2121 Jump Street had me laughing so damn hard . Also Jump Street ; The Animated Series

1 These points are mentioned in Roger Eberts review of the film specifically the machine gun nest . Throughout the film the soldiers complain about being tasked with finding one person and how it is a waste of them as soldiers . So when they come across the nest and when they get the chance at the end they decide to perform what they feel should be their duties and fight .

1 Enjoyment factor I give it 9 / 10 Critic rating , I 'd give it a 7.5 / 10 .

1 There was a shout out on the fan site spaced out for extras . Me and friend are huge spaced fans but we assumed it was basically gon na be a fan film so never bothered going down for filming . We have regretted that decision for fucking ever .

1 Ok , ok , I 'll let you have the last post . A worthy game you 've played and earned it you have . Go on , take it . I promise I wo n't post after you .

1 Sounds like a fun video . Do you have a link ?

1 X Men Origins : The Wolverine

1 It 's a lightsaber , not a sword . You do n't need to put power behind something that can cut through practically anything .

1 My personal favorite was Zach Galifianakis as any Zach Galifianakis character

1 This looks like an album cover . WHAT 'S UP CLEAVLAND ! WE ARE WITCH-KING AND FELLBEAST ! AND WE ARE HERE TO ROCK YOUR FUCKING WORLD ! * nazgul scream *

1 > You keep saying this , but that does n't make it any more true . Again , I do n't know what to tell you here . This is the least controversial thing ever , and I would imagine even many SJWs would acknowledge this . Right or wrong , most people have said something racist at some point in their life . Does n't mean they themselves are hardcore racists , but they 've certainly said plenty of things that would get them in trouble if they said it in the right venue . > It 's not hard to not be a racist . If you really think that it is , then -- and I ca n't stress this enough -- you 're probably a racist . Completely different issue . > There 's a reason that it 's considered repugnant and abhorrent behavior . Normal behavior is n't typically labelled as such . Real racism ? Sure . What we 're talking about ? Not a chance . I mean , are you really under the impression that the average person gives a shit what Gary Oldman , Paula Deen , or Anthony Cumia said ?

1 A dramatic movie based on stomp ? Lets go find a producer .

1 Same here ! Owned it , watched it , even the commentary and special features . I dragged my aunt to the local Toys-R-Us so that she could buy it for my birthday ! I can still remember the look of incredulity she gave me when I said I wanted it . Only now do I understand her pain .

1 When I first saw the trailer for Tropic Thunder I resented the film for this . `` Take actors , put them into a real situation , hilarity ensues '' But hilarity really did ensue in Tropic Thunder , and for a straight up 100 % pure * comedy * , there 's only but so many plots .

1 Agreed

1 I 've said this quite a couple of times but goddamn Guillermo del Toro directing At the Mountains of Madness . I want this movie so damn bad . Also , Terry Gilliam directing the Harry Potter movies , as god intended it to be .

1 Pssst , we know .

1 So many scenes during that movie give me happy tears .

1 I do engulf my self in the experiences but I usually let it marinate in my thoughts at night before I sleep .

1 Good Will Hunting

1 And the hat

1 `` Phantom of the Megaplex '' for me .

1 You can be somewhat sympathetic towards him until he tries to kill his brother , betray the leader of his race and then attempts to commit mass genocide . He went off the deep end * really * fast .

1 All of us tho ?

1 We are are n't we ? I 'm proud of it though . I , genuinely , enjoyed the film and this deleted scene .

1 There 's so many movies about aliens invading and humans fighting back that I find it sort of ridiculous to call any movie with that story a rip-off of Independence Day . Pacific Rim could be considered a rip-off as well . But I think we 've been telling stories about fighting back against invaders since the beginning of time . It 's just a common theme in stories .

1 Pretty much any Frank Darabont adaptation of a Stephen King story seems to be better in movie form . The Green Mile and the Mist I also thought were better than their counterparts .

1 I dont think the foot position is the most compelling part of the color credits though . The most compelling part is that ALL the characters are shown as they were when alive . The one `` inconsistency '' is Bill , who is laying down `` dead '' on the ground . But it becomes rectified if it indicates Bill is not actually dead , merely pretending . It becomes especially compelling when coupled with the B & W credits and David 's name not being crossed out . The foot position is superfluous imo

1 With innovations like the [ C String ] ( http : / www.huffingtonpost.com / 2011 / 05 / 20 / cstring-underwear_n_864682.html ) , I concur .

1 The one thing that was said about the character was that he had a valid license , which I assume was given to him by his `` aunt '' .

1 > probably lol casual .

1 Cell : Got arrested before for a small crime ? We do n't see his whole life so .. Girl appartment : He does n't jump to her room but the clearly vissable balcony , he then jumps back to the lair , they hold open the portal . Portal gets closed by other jumper but he has already been there so when he jumps back he knows where to jump .

1 Haha `` does the vaccuming '' . I do n't know why that is so funny .

1 Still , it 's worth noting that that human is smaller than all of their mouths

1 Please no more Spiderman . You have pussified his character enough . You have turned Mary Jane into the most undesirable redhead . You have turned the most classic comic book into emo-laden chick flick .

1 Do you need subtitles or something ?

1 that was quick .

1 If you 've seen the trailer , do n't you know that the city gets attacked ? And is n't it pretty much a given that , in a Superman movie , someone or something will attack metropolis and Superman will save the city ?

I find I score lots of good cheap DVD soon after the Blu comes out . SCOOP ! I already had Bullit and Great Escape , currently hunting for Magnificent Seven , Le Mans , Junnior Bonner , The Getaway etc .

1 Did I say we did n't get films early . No . If we do , usually it 's like a week or two in advance , not like 2 months . Paddington and Inbetweeners are primarily for the UK anyway . I agree though , Paddington should have been released pre Christmas because the snowy setting for the film makes it perfect for that time of year . Inbetweeners if i 'm correct had other issues involved in why it did n't get a US release . But regardless of that , those movies are n't , you know , Oscar nominated flicks or a Disney film that will bring home the big money . These movies should be expected to be released worldwide within 2 weeks of the domestic release , not fucking 2 or 3 months . Whiplash has n't even been in cinemas for a month over here and already it 's gone from Vue , ODEON , and is only on once a day at Cineworld . Shame , really . Really wanted to pay to see it , wanted to go tomorrow , but now I ca n't and had to use other ways to watch it .

1 The Thing is always a related movie , in fact , we should make this a thing .

1 Probably not . Feature films are extremely complicated to produce . The timeframes are often extremely limited and strict . Sometimes they only have a certain amount of time on location . It 's likely they would have had to scrap that scene and reshoot it later , which is very costly .

1 I personally would n't say Scarface * is * that good ... but it does have * some * measure of development - Tony wants power and money , and suffers because of it ; he saves a woman and her child from being murdered and learns that in the world of high profile drug dealing , unless you get your hands dirty you 're never really in power - he spirals until he crashes and burns in the finale . With the Avengers it is n't really about the individual character development ( that 's handled in all the individual films ) - it 's about the development of the characters as a * team * ... it 's no accident that the big cathartic moment at the end is a shot of them all together , facing the enemy having put aside their differences . Even then , there 's some individual development : Thor learns that his problem is n't necessarily his own - other people have suffered at his brothers hands ; Tony and Cap learn to work together despite their differences ( Tony especially : 'Call it , Cap ! ' ) ; Of course we see Banner go from nervous scientist to in-control Hulk ... but that 's more of a development for the viewer , rather than the character himself actually developing during the film . Of course all of these individual growths are funneled into their growth as a team ; as I said , the characters themselves are developed in their own films : )

1 Michael Caine was fucking amazing in this film .

1 That 's a scene , not a single frame ...

1 That 's what bothers me the most here . OP took the time out to make a post which tries to teach you about cinematography with an actual recent example which uses cinematography a bit differently . I understand that you may feel it does n't work , but that does n't mean you have to disregard everything . You can still look at the intuition and think `` okay it does n't work for me because ... '' Instead , people just bury their heads in the sand and criticize whoever comes to a conclusion which they do n't get .

1 its a shame there are n't more complex concepts in childrens movies . I do enjoy having to explain the entire plot over again afterwards to the kiddies

1 I really hope this is a cruel April Fool 's joke .

1 I 'll watch it . I like David Fincher .

1 no , it was n't

1 The thing is , an effort needs to be made to integrate the worlds of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings . Just saying that they both took place in Middle Earth is n't enough . Tolkien used the ring to bind the two books ( after he had written Lord of the Rings -- he went back and changed bits of the Hobbit ) . And Gandalf , of course . But knowing the storm of war that was building even in Bilbo 's time , could Jackson have ignored all that happened in Lord of the Rings , and all the characters ? I do n't see anything wrong with a little creative crossover , as long as the central plot is preserved .

1 There 's this new thing called Internet . I think you can get information there .

1 You know they thought about this .

1 MST3K + 500 = M500K = Movies 500K . . . I have no idea .

1 A = You just smoked a joint B = You have n't seen the movie in a while , and it slipped your mind . C = You are not a smart man D = All of the above

1 I love this plan ! I 'm excited to be a part of it !

1 Not this sub-reddit please , I love r / movies too much to have it spoiled by memes .

1 Why ca n't we just appreciate this as a great movie and book and leave it at that . Hollywood is milking stories too long .

1 Ah ok ... well that film is pretty historically accurate , so I thought it kinda serves as its own explanation .

1 If liking Dredd is wrong then I do n't want to be right .

1 So in an IMAX theater ?

1 I 'd like it to end with [ The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny ] ( http : / youtu.be / xwBK31tC5QM )

1 Rikki-Tikki-Linklater is now my favorite nickname .

1 Yes , it is absolutely worth it . Not the finest one , but absolutely worth it .

1 Seriously , the fight sequences in that movie are insane , more people need to watch it .

1 Exactly ! I feel like I spent 2 unfulfilling hours watching that thing .

1 They do that to cut down on cgi costs , its not an aesthetic choice . If they have more money the second time around they can probably show more fighting in the day .

1 Absolutely and I loved how it was simple , but yet requires a lot of thought to get everything together . Immediately after watching it I felt like I should watch it again .

1 Agreed , throw some Spike Jonze / Charlie Kaufman collaborations in there as well ( Being John Malkovitch , Adaptation ) .

1 You must , it 's awesome

1 Or the allegations will have no weight whatsoever over whether his art is any good ? I mean he could be a baby slayer and his art would still be genius and I 'd watch it .

1 I avoided it for so long because I was pissed about the Brokeback snub , but once I watched it I agree , it 's a genuinely good film . But it 's also a `` watch once then forget about it '' film too , whereas Brokeback was a highly significant film released right around the time when the fight for equality was picking up .

1 Take Shelter hit me by surprise in its ability to keep the suspense going . Michael Shannon 's straight face made me think the premise was going to be too easy for him . Too typecasted in a way . I 'm glad I doubted it and watched it . I 'm very excited to see Man of Steel now .

1 There 's always some chance you 'll end up with people like that ; it is n't limited to movies . I recently had to put up with someone in the most expensive seats at top-10-in-US-company opera premier take out his iPhone and start taking photographs ... they were even * less * equipped to deal with this than a movie theatre would have been .

1 This image has been posted like 5 times in this thread lol .

1 I agree with you . They made The Riddler into a sort of Joker-like character when they cast Jim Carrey .

1 Not new actors .

1 While I ca n't confirm the first claim , Kutcher 's a horrible actor .

1 You should see Hot Rod . I think it fits in to your style . And it 's absolutely hilarious .

1 `` These are the Cubans , baby . These are the Cohibas , the Montecristos . This is a kinetic-kill , side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst .

1 Like the others , it is tenuous in it 's relationship with the source material , but as a movie it is quite entertaining . It is pretty clear that they ran out of book though .

1 Those are amazing and the hour and half each review takes goes by so fast . Mike and Jay should really be a professional script consultants . If I had the cash , I 'd pay them to tell me what 's good and bad with my scripts when I write them .

1 And that film , along with 7 others , were completely written , filmed , produced , and released by Linklater before he even finished Boyhood .

1 It 's ok , you can say shit here .

1 That 's not true but in this particular situation China would never side with NK .

1 We 're taking about Mel here , not Jamie Foxx .

1 Yes , that is the conclusion I arrived at as well . The driver is Gordon in disguise and since he was in on the whole plan it would make sense for him to try to spring the Joker 's trap .

1 It follows the novella pretty closely ... but the novella is n't very good .

1 `` which ... heheh ... .which button calls your parents to pick you up ''

1 Actually , I 'm pretty sure he 's a former addict who keeps busy to prevent himself from relapsing .

1 At the time I thought Sunday was * pretending * to be a twin , because he was embarrassed about needing money . Plainview arrived at the house and saw Sunday again , but instead of exposing him , he kept quiet in order keep their identities hidden ( Plainview was pretending to be an innocent camper ) . I eventually realised I was completely wrong .

1 Alternative headline : Peter Jackson gives up on 48fps , stating `` Well , we were all for it , but then some guys saw a few minutes of fast cut footage and started whining about it . So to appease them we have decided to drop the 48fps . We have also decided to drop 3D and to reshoot the entire film on 16mm Bolex cameras . Because apparently that 's what you assholes want from me . Here - take my blood as well . ''

1 > WHERE IS THE CODEX ? !

1 > I also really liked The Devil 's Backbone . Pan 's Labyrinth and The Orphanage are the natural recommendations then ( though I expect you 've seen both of those if you 've seen The Devil 's Backbone , and Pan 's is n't actually horror ) .

1 The whole of the Harry Potter series is that , on the surface , Harry is a hero , but when you look into it he is just in the right place at the right time a lot ( or the wrong place at the right time ) and has a bunch of talented friends helping him along . Then when you look even deeper , it 's about how that does n't matter , because it 's the strength of Harry 's friendships , his ability to bring out the best in people , that makes them succeed .

1 Die Hard Halo fan since '01 . If it has `` Halo '' on it , you can guarantee I have it , am on the way to having it , or will have it . XboxOne : a $ 500 Halo machine in my eyes .

1 Or they 're past the point of indulging in fanfiction-calibre writing from the mind of a 15 year old boy . Sucker Punch is n't deep or metaphorical ; it bashes you over the head with a big club labelled `` subtlety '' while dumping awful-smelling goo on you from buckets labelled `` artful stylism '' . The whole production was so heavy-handed and exposition-filled , you could derive more subjective meaning from the average children 's cartoon .

1 Joker still won , Batman and Gordon `` cheated '' by lying and covering everything up which still ends up fucking them in dark knight rises . Even if the lie held up over the years Joker would have that victory over batman forever .

1 He 's got soul but he 's not a soldier .

1 That scene is n't a depiction of Paradise Lost so much as it is Paradise Annihilated . There 's so many great shots in that film : Willard 's face juxtaposed with face of the statue in that opening sequence , Kurtz reciting The Hollow Men , Willard emerging from the swamp with his face camouflaged , Lance floating Chief 's body out into the river . Damn near every shot of that film could be framed and hung on the wall .

1 I 'd say that the Riddles in the Dark chapter is the most iconic in the whole book ... to me as a kid I loved the Gollum scenes more than even Bilbo meeting Smaug . That 's a scene that could never have been perfect for me on film , lol . I do n't even know if I would like Del Toro 's version of it , but I 'd be curious how he would have pulled it off . But yeah I think the film version of it was really saved by Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis ' performances . Something about the staging did n't feel right ( I 'd agree it was too light , but filming a scene in pitch black would be incredibly annoying to most filmgoers ) . The one detail I loved was the cat-like reflection when Gollum crawls into the space Bilbo fell into .

1 So how about anyone who has benefited from the numerous acts of murder , rape and / or other forms of brutality carried out by their ancestors ( hint : every single person on earth ) is the beneficiary of murder , rape and / or brutality ?

1 Yeah the youtube link is for a Korean film while the correct one is a Taiwanese film .

1 So what does it all mean , dexter ?

1 I 'm so glad that the article detailed the fact that it 's a `` passion project '' for him - I love his previous works , and I think that even were he not so passionate about Mountains , he 'd do it justice . So I 've no loss of optimism about the project from these developments .

1 except that is n't Hans Zimmer . Thats from another guy called Zack Hempsey . Hes amazing . He does badass trailer music , like for Game of Thrones .

1 At least the ILM ( the studio that did the VE ) was nominated for two other movies that year ... probably not the same team , but it 's something close .

1 Also , in the Toy Story Halloween special . The toys step in a sticky substance on a motel room floor . They then try to figure out what it is . They stepped in cum . The toys from Disney Pixar stepped in cum . I understood it , but the kids I was watching with did not .

1 What a subgenre !

1 Fun Fact : The director told them separately to come up with a talent to share with the other actor . The result , that scene . I believe it was only shot once and that was their genuine reaction to each other . Loved that .

1 I feel like some of the things were a little over the top . IE the `` man talk '' in the barber shop . I 've been to very homely local barber shops in the woods , etc and all the old fucks there never speak like that . But as you said `` Eh , it 's Clint Eastwood ! '' Aside from that I absolutely adore the movie and think everyone should watch it . I feel like you can take a lot out of the movie , life lessons , etc .

1 Seems like a google list . I would n't agree with the Shining or Perks of being a wallflower either , and I 've read about 6 of the books on this list . I 'll take the less popular road though and say that I did like A Clockwork Orange the movie a bit better . I own both though and reread the book every few years .

1 Good choice . That is such a good movie . That soundtrack ... oh my god .

1 Very similar , but the book was worth reading . It 's basically the same book but its also good , rather than a straight ripoff ...

1 Watched it last week and really liked it . Did n't find it confusing in the slightest . I checked the reviews for it too and no one else seems to either . But as always , Comments claiming a movie is n't as good as it 's reviews will always be upvoted , regardless of accuracy .

1 I disagree . In my experience , his accent was pretty dead-on . Fun fact , though : apparently , he wanted to be in Ritchie 's next movie after he 'd seen Lock , Stock , and Two Smoking Barrels and loved it . So they talked and he got a role in Snatch , but it turns out he just could not do the English accent to save his life , so he got a different role . Personally , I think it all worked out quite well .

1 I believe that 's from Family Guy , The Road to Europe .

1 Considering he makes several times that for other roles , it 's a major pay cut .

1 Technically , Norton 's * Hulk * was the first test ( remember the post-credits scene ? RDJ met up with General Ross in a bar about a `` team '' that the Hulk was on now . ) , but that did n't do too well , so people mainly remember IM1 as the starting point .

1 Wow , I 've never noticed that before ... well done ! Surely it should just freeze at 301+ views , then after an hour or so , they can hit refresh and see that another vlogger has stolen it and claimed it as their own ?

B wings in RTJ were single manned but some later versions in the legends EU had a gunner as well .

1 For the sake of the joke I wish he was playing Kraven .

1 Funny enough that 's actually what happened to fairy tales , as well .

1 Movies have a 24fps rate which gives it that feel . What you 're describing is the fact that they left the shutter of the camera open , which is called a 360 ? shutter . It makes for more motion blur , but it allowed for more light to be captured in scenes like the night time forest shootout . 60fps is typically used for slow motion in movies .

1 `` Do n't get drunk , D2P4 ! '' * slurred beeping *

1 They 're using it in the sense of : > work in an organized and active way toward a particular goal , typically a political or social one .

1 Thor in the movies is n't magic . He 's an alien with incredibly advanced technology . Also , Superman is n't weak to magic , he 's vulnerable to it . You know who else is vulnerable to magic ? Iron Man . Iron Man was hit by Mjolnir and its lightning several times and he was okay . Superman in Man of Steel took far worse punishment than Iron Man ever has in the movies . Not to mention the very likely event that Superman can pick up Mjolnir . Then there 's the fact that Man of Steel Superman is so much faster and can dodge most of Thor 's attacks anyway .

1 From my understanding , the main exaggeration was that they portrayed Nash as having visual hallucinations , when in actuality he only had auditory hallucinations . From a narrative perspective , that makes a lot of sense , because it would probably be a lot harder to convey his story through film in a compelling way while only depicting his condition as voices in his head .

1 I did not like it . The music took me out of the film at times . Django 's arc from slave to badass felt incomplete and in the end it was much more about killing bad white people than Django having closure with Broomhilda . One could argue that this was also the case in Inglorious Basterds put I would counter that in that film this was the main motivation from the onset , kill Nazis in particular Hitler . Now there where some great scenes however on the whole I feel the movie did not live up to the sum of it 's parts . To touch on the hot topic as well on language and the factuality of how people behaved back then i find it odd that the arguement for using the word n * r over 100 times is that this could / would most likely be the case . I agree . That is how people spoke and that is fine by me . The casualness of it 's is what i think people found shocking and that is reflective of that time . It is really no different than how Mad Men was such a misogynistic show which reflected THAT era . The problem is there is a huge sensitivity still to that word and if your argument is `` historical accuracy '' then you should make a film that is more accurate of the times . There is no way Django could read and dynamite was n't invented as yet are 2 very big things that come to mind if accuracy were paramount . You ca n't have your cake and eat it too . In actuality the word was used for laughs and to paint a broad stroke picture of the `` bad guys '' vs the `` good guys '' . The problem is there is no justification for using it in this context so it 's historical accuracy as the reason and that does n't hold up .

A class system is installed , with the elites inhabiting the front of the train and the poor inhabiting the tail . You 're kidding -- plot holes in * this * ? ? ? You mean to say there was n't complete logical cohesion in this story about a magical train that crosses the earth during an ice age ? I 'm appalled !

1 That line just made me smile : - )

1 Admittedly , white actors voicing POC roles is problematic but * at least * the characters were drawn somewhat ethnically accurate . Also , Katzenberg consulted with biblical scholars ( jewish and christian ) , muslim theologians and Arab American leaders supposedly in an attempt to be both respectful and historically / culturally accurate to both religious and secular audiences . I believe there is even a Hebrew dub . Compare with Scott taking about how the whitewashing was financially motivated , critics need to get over it , blah blah blah . I think Bale is even quoted as describing Moses : > ? I think the man was likely schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life ? At least Dreamworks tried .

1 I do n't think I could be excited for anything . I 'm so fucking curious about this .

1 This comment makes me sad . I do n't know why .

1 For some reason I think she was one of the hottest ones .

1 So hungry now .

1 Sounds like an Adam Sandler comedy now..

1 It 's a beautiful opening , but does n't really fit in with these challenging live-action shots .

1 The Dark Side FTW !

1 Since Ant-Man is so unknown to non-comic readers , I think you have to use both . Hank Pym makes the suit , Scott Lang steals it . Unlike Hulk who smashes and Iron Man who shoots lasers and rockets , Ant-Mans powers would require some explanation , which is why having the good guy and bad guy using the same powers is a good idea . It gives Ant-Man more screen time overall and the audience more exposure to the powers . What 'd be awesome is if Pym makes a new suit to battle Scott Lang after he steals the original suit , then have that new suit have a yellow hue . That 'd be a cool shout out to fanboys who would recognize it is inspired by the Yellow Jacket costume ( but they should n't ever call it that in the movie ) .

1 also , pigeons .

1 4 / 10 Americans agree , the majority .

1 Quinto likes men , so at least half of that stare is hungry for cock !

1 Why does every new movie have the word `` Nine '' in it lately . Besides that this looks like it could be quite good .

1 But the dancing ...

1 The studio submits actors into categories they are most likely to win . The foreign press association does n't choose the nominees they just decide based on what is entered . I have n't seen Big Eyes but basically any movie that is n't 100 % drama can be up for comedy or musical .

1 Grandma 's boy . Superbad . 40 year old virgin . Pineapple Express . I get a little nostalgic when I watch these . Reminds me of my sophomore year of high school .

1 I do n't think he wanted to be there , and that might show . He outright refused to participate until fairly recently when it 's been suggested Beverly D'Angelo apparently more or less called in a personal favor .

1 It 's not significant news when Ben Affleck has been cast as Batman and the movie is shooting . Also , this came out in like July 2013 , before the casting of Ben Affleck was known and people were still speculating who could be Batman .

1 > Kyle Chandler is pretty much Robert Forster Jr . oh my god you 're totally right , I ca n't help but like them in anything they do .

1 I second Arlington Road . Though I hate to promote the fact it ends good for the villain

1 Heh

1 Not sure to what you are referring , but as far as I know , did n't Ebert wholeheartedly praise Pulp Fiction when it was released ? He does say he did n't know what the hell had happened to him when he first saw it , though , which I guess is somewhat what we all felt .

1 It 's a great outfit and I 've never seen him in it while out of character . I think he 's out of character anyway . But yeah , the main reason is how much I love that costume .

1 Was n't that a TV show ?

1 I , too , was 3 when Episode 1 came out . Same results here .

1 One of the most Definitive Sci-Fi * films * of the 2000 's definitively .

1 Just about anything by Cronenberg .

1 That dude had so much passion for that film . I really hope he keeps that feeling for the sequel and walks away from the series before it becomes too much for him , like I guess what Whedon is doing .

1 I 've been rooting for the Zombies more than Sophia for the last 3 episodes .

1 Signs 2 ?

1 Do n't , I 'm a 31 year old , heavily bearded very straight married man , and I watch the shit out of that movie ! Mostly because it brings back memories of college . I was actually in a show choir so yeah . Not acapella tho..

1 Looks just like him . He is a big time * actor * , pulling off suave should be a piece of cake .

1 ... Hooray ...

1 I thought Neighbors was great !

1 You mean to tell me that those comments at the bottom with dozens of downvotes represent all of Reddit ?

1 I actually thought Oblivion was pretty good . It had some plot holes , but it was still pretty good .

1 Indie-rock douches make 99 % of reddit .

1 Well I can think of at least one technical reason . Spaceships * that * size would pose a threat to inhabited planets if for some reason they loose control and are in a collision course - it would be similar to the impact of a reasonably large asteroid ... Now if you just vaporize the ship into a huge explosion probably the remaining bits will be small enough to just burn up in the atmosphere . Also , the self-destruct mechanism from what I got involved just shutting down the cooling system of the reactor so that the thing would eventually blow up ( something that happens also in `` Aliens '' due to damage to the reactor instead ) . So it seems that the ship would have a form of self-destruction regardless of realistic situations where that could be used ...

1 It 's a return of the Jedi , Anakin Skywalker , who was lost and turned into the dark force Darth Vader . It 's his return to grace , aided by his son .

1 I 'm just saying the scale and cost of the fake highway is impressive . The comment I replied to dismissed the comparison to actual roadwork as absurd because building a movie set is often nothing like real architecture . In this case however he 's wrong . According to some quick research , the cost of the highway set in Matrix Reloaded is actually comparable to the construction of real roads , although it definitely falls toward the cheap end of the scale .

1 I feel like you do n't get the same experience watching shorter versions of the film . Part of the ordeal is just being at sea for so long , and the 5 hour version does a pretty good job approximating the tedium the sailors must have felt .

1 Rise of the family , fall of the family . Lowest point being Michael casting out his wife and killing his own brother .

1 Alice in Wonderland

1 Are The Mummy movies really guilty pleasures though ?

1 Romans also do n't speak with a British accent .

1 I se you 're getting some downvotes , but I agree . Judge Dredd works best when it focuses on the dystopian themes of the books , not mindless cool-looking action . I 'm sure I sound pretentious but as I get older I appreciate a novel story more and more over visual violence and a cool look .

1 I totally read that as `` Garfield vs Gojira '' at first , and just so you know , I was 100 % on board .

1 I do n't think the Riddick universe is misogynistic . The series has a very narrow focus , Riddick . Who can be summed up as a survivor and an individualist at all costs . He is n't evil but he is ruthless . Everyone around him dies because while he 's a target , he attracts violence like shit attracts flies . So the mercs die , the civilians die , the women die . The difference is that if you say something nasty to a man before he dies it 's funny . If you say something nasty about women it 's misogynistic . Aside from the black girl in the most recent movie , who was more of a plot device than a character , all of the women in the series have been independent and tough . Orphan , pilot , convict , politician , merc . They all held their own , including when things get hard or people insult them . They also all died , but hey ... so did everyone else .

1 Yeah . That district manager that goes around killing people in The Terminator is a real * stickler for the rules * .

1 You want to find an outlaw , hire an outlaw . You want to find a Dunkin ' Donuts , call a cop .

1 This exactly . A lot of people have developed this list of abstracted storytelling principles and their brain throws up a warning sign whenever it recognizes a violation . I understand that these `` principles '' do bear some credence -- explaining the plot sometimes comes at the expense of characterization , and on-the-nose themes can feel preachy or didactic -- but sometimes circumstances warrant an exception . A good example of this is Inception . Now I 'm not here to say that everyone should enjoy this movie and that people who do n't are a bunch of highbrow snobs . Everyone has different tastes . But I think this predisposed mindset prevents a lot of would-be fans from enjoying or appreciating an otherwise good movie . Inception has been criticized a lot for its dialogue being too expository , as is the case with most Nolan films . And in a sense they 're right -- Nolan creates a lot of weak and one-dimensional characters who do n't really carry much emotional weight with them . But I would much rather listen to a character explain the plot of Inception to me than for one to do the same about the plot of Transformers . Some subjects definitely do merit heavy expository description . Nolan movies in particular , which rely pretty heavily on plot , create a sense of wonder with how they explore natural phenomena like dreams , memory , or time travel through pretty simple characters . I do n't believe he 's one of the greatest directors , or that his movies are artistic masterpieces , but they do have many distinguishing characteristics that a lot of viewers find enjoyable . I think it says something about what we have yet to uncover about film 's potential as a medium for creative expression . We just need to keep our minds open about things without compromising our honesty and moderation in criticism .

1 What ? It 's totally a reference to the Lazarus Pit . Yes , Nolan redefined it , but it was a definite and obvious nod to the pit that Bane is born from . And Talia definitely has connection to the pit through her father , who discovered the pit , so it can work . It 's at least understandable how Nolan felt he needed to connect her to it . Think about it -- Nolan could n't very well have a supernatural force in his superhero saga that he 's notoriously grounded to reality . So he turned it into a prison where those that manage to climb out are `` reborn . ''

1 I liked it at the time . It 's more or less a depiction of the classic novel . I like their take on the near future , how we destroyed the moon by trying to build on it . The actual time travel scene itself is one of the best parts of the film .

1 I do n't think it was miscast , I just do n't think that character should exist .

1 Ahh yes the ending of Mrs Doubtfire . This one always hit home for me because my parents divorced not long before the first time I saw the movie . Never fails to surface some emotion .

1 Id prefer some jasmine tea ... it 's my favorite .

1 Indeed ! Any idea why ?

1 > The Si * th 's S * peech I think I just bit off my tongue trying to pronounce this !

1 The film is * fantastic * , too . If anyone 's never seen it , go see it .

1 The joke with the tourists was that the only people who come to Muppet Studios are Walter and people-who-are-really-lost . The tourists could have been from any country , even a potentially European one that does n't speak English , but because they were Asian ( I do n't know what kind ) , that makes it racist ? Although Mary very clearly wants Gary to propose , this is a facet of the fact that their relationship is very , very important to her . Heck , the anniversary dinner comes across as more important to her ; sometimes people really value heteronormative , traditional relationships and that is okay . Mary herself , is portrayed as pretty capable - Not only is she apparently a great teacher , but she 's very mechanically inclined . Do they play her mechanic skills for laughs ? Only as much as it clashes with your notions of traditional gender roles .

1 Over the top , but if you want to hit the masses and have the largest impact , that 's the best route to go . It 's no different than * the cove * and how it was shot like an oceans 11 film . Think of it as a different genre , a cross between documentary and blockbuster film . It has a reality tv vibe applied to the big screen . It 's going to have an agenda , and create drama and thrills out of thin air . Not to say it 's bad , but people need to see it for what it is .

1 You sound pretty pretentious to me , and I would know . ; )

1 [ That 's because villains are best when British ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=YON7CgavGMI )

1 One of my favorite quotes from the show : * `` I have simpler tastes . I like to kill my enemies , take their gold and enjoy their women . That 's it . Why tie yourself to one ? Where 's the flavor ? Where 's the joy ? '' * * `` Pullo , when is the last time you had a woman who was n't crying or wanting payment ? '' * Fucking LOL everytime .

1 I liked the way that the [ Animated Version ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=k2gE7-J9B6w ) ended . It still has a cheesy foreshadowing to Lord of the Rings , but it 's much more optimistic about it and lets you know that Bilbo at least has earned his happy ending .

1 I 'm baffled . I guess OP is impressed that the movie does n't have a continuity error ?

1 Really funny !

1 Rapture with perfect 90 degree dolly shots . Yes .

1 Interesting choice of words

1 I never watched the last two and decided I 'd give it a go and watch this one . I did n't need to know the backstory so at least that was good . But the dialogue was horrible , the transiti from scene to scene was bad , and it felt like they just mashed a lot of scenes together . If the other two Taken movies are like this I 'm surprised as to why there was so much hype over this . I thought there would be a kidnapping of the daughter as well but nobody even gets * Taken * .

1 Loki reveals the illusion . Thor does n't see through it .

1 Nice to see you around ... I am stoked for this .

1 I would call it a different approach . IMO , a rushed schedule would be coming out with large amount of movies within 1-2 years .

1 [ * It Might Get Loud * ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1229360 / ? ref_=nm_flmg_slf_35 ) is pretty tasty . ETA : [ * You 're Gon na Miss Me * ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0791268 / ) is more similar to the Johnston story ( and also pretty tasty ) .

1 Mr Dorff is probably ecstatic .

1 Oh self aware continuity errors are the best .

1 Which cost like $ 70 million , in comparison..

1 IKNOW ! Im worried he might be a bit of a diva . Those things can get in the way . Croupier is a classic . One of the best gambling movies and words .

1 I 'm pretty sure that the reason why no-one can us it is because of the magic powering it , not the fact it 's super heavy . Straight from Wiki : Mjolnir itself has several enchantments : no living being may lift the hammer unless they are worthy . So when he puts it on a table , or on a hook like in the film , it 's just a `` normal '' weight . Whereas when someone else tries to move it , it 's not possible - Examples being when he places Mjonir on top of Loki in the first film and Hulk trying to pick it up in Avengers .

1 Great . He and Gary Oldman came to work , it was just a shitty project .

1 Shhhhh

1 Oh it 's on a soundstage then get completely sucked in . Great movie that I will never see again .

1 > Their parts are usually very different movie to movie Except in Tim Burton movies .

1 I would love to see Daniel Day-Lewis in a Coen brothers film .

1 In the UK there is a chain of pubs that deals purely to serve cheap ( but wholesome ) food and low priced alcohol to the public . These pubs are called J.D.Wetherspoons or just a `` Wetherspoons '' . His joke was a play on Reese 's name .

1 That was kind of the point though . It added to Ripley 's isolation . I 'm not saying that 's the direction I wanted to see the series go , but at least they tried something different .

1 but the comet keeps falling through the brush , this is unfair , just like the jello , how am i supposed to get that much water into that tiny fucking box

1 My username is a throwback to my childhood dominated by my love for Jurassic Park . This was a great watch . I always knew the movie was a mix of cgi and physical props but I guess I never considered the work that went into make that massive beast . It was really enlightening . Next time I watch it I 'll have all this in mind .

1 Yip , Dwarzes are n't scaled down humans , they have their own proportions

1 He does die in the first five minutes but he was n't the original..he actually was the main antagonist in Airborne..the one that the protagonist dates his sister

1 Why not ? It would get the blame off them ...

1 I agree that the movie was flawed but I liked the ending . I think there were too many stupid things for drama ( like every police officer going into the sewers ) and it was overall much worse than The Dark Knight . That being said , I really did like the ending . Between people 's criticisms of this and AI , it 's like people are conflating depressing with quality .

1 The article says there will be a mid-credit scene . Just no post-credit scene .

1 With the original soundtrack and at least one scene featuring a cardboard box .

1 Wut ?

1 He would have made an interesting Diggler ( although , I am happy how Boogie Nights turned out ) , but you ca n't argue he did n't make the right career choice . Titanic shot him to stardom , made him a household name , and is likely the reason he is able to do so many great films now .

1 What about ... like ... * MMMM-HMMM *

1 Ohh that 's good !

1 Damn . That 's a good idea now that the robot battle show is coming back . Why do n't the have air battles as well ? That 'd be dope !

1 > Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Godzilla I thought this is a title of Uwe Boll version

1 I am so embarrassed . I corrected what I could since .

1 > It 's set in Australia , but Australia is n't going to get the movie til 6 months after this ( probably ) Nice one movie industry . Yet another bit of media we 'll be getting off torrents instead of slinging you a few bucks .

1 Never compare Junior with Twins , Twins is great

1 The dialogue in that film is more than good , it 's amazing ! How many times do we quote that film a week ? 'Here 's looking at you kid . ' 'This could be the start of a beautiful friendship . ' And that 's just the last scene ! The plotting is tighter than Bernard Purdie drum break and there are so many little things that get glossed over because the whole film is full of gems . My personal fave is when Louis ( the police chief ) says something about never gambling then some guy comes over and gives him his winnings . Black and white films require a great script because unlike today where people hire FX people to distract from shitty plotting , scripting and lack of ideas , that 's what people relied upon . Check out The Marx Brothers ( not the Three Stooges , all that slapping was bullshit ) for how to make a little go a long way .

1 > You keep using that word , I do not think it means what you think it means .

1 Contemplates pointing out that opinions are subjective ... Forget it Jake , it 's Chinatown .

1 Nah he means when he gets back in the good timeline his life is better , and his family is rich and successful .

1 Do n't get my hopes up like that ...

1 That was a penisy thing to say man .

1 He hated Mr . Incredible because he crushed his dreams when he was a smart kid trying to help . His vengeance was to come against the superheroes by presenting himself , a self made superhero , to the public , making millions off turning everyone into superheroes , and thus eliminating the idea of genetic superiority . Since everyone is super , by comparison , no one is super .

1 Oh no . I was still suckered in by ultra rad skater , David Spade .

1 Same . My brother and I LOVE saying the Arnold quotes in public as a kind of inside joke . We grew up on the movie , and we both love it .

1 Lose the arm .

1 Napoleon Dynamite .

1 I 'm in Australia so Christmas Eve was last night . I watched it as always and was a crying mess on the couch . Its a strange film in that its so sentimental and presents such an idealised version of an American town , so much so that its hardly believable . But its a great cast with quick dialogue and such a beautiful ending . Jimmy Stewart is fantastic . No man is a failure who has friends . Merry Christmas to all : )

1 Yeah , oddly that irked me even more than the terrible title .

1 I love in the Red Letter Media review where they talk about that part . `` And it 's like ten minutes long and they 're just * talking * and I was so BORED . I started playing poker on my phone . '' `` Chris Cooper is an * Academy Award winning * actor . There 's plenty of great actors in this movies , it 's just ... shit ! '' [ Link to video ] ( http : / redlettermedia.com / half-in-the-bag-transcendence-and-the-amazing-spider-man-2 / )

1 haha if you watch the commentary , Peter Jackson fully admits that Denathor probably would n't have been able to run like a quarter mile while on fire.. but he just really wanted that shot of him falling off the side of the tower and then the camera pulling back to reveal the full scope of the battle on the field . It * is * a pretty cool shot .

1 I loved this one . In my opinion the `` fuck everyone '' speech did n't really fit in with the rest of the movie .

1 /r/stephenking

1 yes , it 's very uncomfortable , but I think I appreciate the movie for not being explicit , not showing the deaths and so , to achieve that . Anyway , it 's a movie that I do n't think I will watch again . But , the way the main `` bad '' character talks to the camera , and interacts with the viewers , to show them the happy endings do n't exist in `` real '' life , it 's quite interesting .

1 Why was this downvoted ? Is n't this movie 70s - 80s NY ?

1 People , what a bunch of bastards .

1 Yes . Many reviewers are currently making unfounded comparisons to the Fast and Furious franchise , which are n't `` unavoidable '' as The Verge reviewer contends , when the filmmakers clearly intended to make a quality Roger Corman film . It 's not like Need for Speed makes it subtle . It 's often very heavy-handed in drawing these comparisons with B movie driving films , but the film is definitely not a bad movie .

1 Not really because as the image is captured on film , it has the characteristics of the film i.e. the colour cast , softness and film grain . Then the filmmakers can scan the film using very high quality scanners at upto 8K resolution which gives an incredibly high resolution image to work with in post production . I think O Brother Where Art Thou was the first film to use this technique where each frame was scanned using a film scanner and the images where then digitally processed in post to give the film that sepia look .

1 Not really

1 Films need to earn about double their budget before they start making money . The film studio only gets a portion of the box office back from the theaters , and there 's also marketing costs to recoup that do n't get factored into the film 's budget . However , the film has probably made money by now on video .

1 Just say you want firefly already . I do too !

1 [ They did ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=S3TKCeGc2Ao )

1 Dying to see this . It was n't my favourite Welsh novel but the trailers look like they have n't been shy about their depiction of Bruce .

1 The difference is that Ledger had portrayed himself to have a wide range and excellent acting chops at that point , but he had n't done anything that dark or crazy yet . Afleck has proven that he has none of this .

1 Sony is always watching .

1 do you know that if Bruce Lee was still alive , Tarantino would have cast him as that role ?

1 How about `` until SOMEONE has seen it and actually talked about the contents of the movie ? '' It 's not just that they have n't seen the movie , it 's not even out yet . People may decide from the trailers not to see a movie , but they are n't actually going to know if they were `` right '' until it comes out .

1 Can not wait for this movie . Their youtube channel for anyone that 's unaware of their work . http : / www.youtube.com / britanick

1 We 'd be honored to be in the same breathe as those flicks

1 It 's actually the year 2030 and movies are so much better now . Sometimes I forget I 'm writing to people in the past . Do n't worry !

1 There are way worse movies if you go back far enough . the Greatest Show on Earth had Jimmy Stewart in clown makeup .

1 This is probably the correct explanation of Wilder 's term . On a side note , I do n't see this use of `` fey '' as particularly pejorative towards homosexuals , if you take the meaning as `` effeminate '' . It 's a style choice , and gay men , many of whom have indubitable style , make choices that identify them as * gay * men of fashion , as compared to generically fashionable men .

1 RATED PG-13

1 Do you mean the expedition that [ never left the galaxy ? ] ( http : / starwars.wikia.com / wiki / Outbound_Flight_Project )

1 It 's a plot point in the anime and manga that Mikasa is one of the last Asian people left alive . She 's rare , so those guys tried to kidnap her when she was younger . Pretty much everyone else in Attack on Titan is supposed to be white . If anything , this shows that America and Japan are the same when it comes to casting , and that any country will change the race of a character to make it more convenient for themselves .

1 Man ; Clerks 3 is gon na be the bomb , yo .

1 You 're forgetting they have to actually make the films though . It would take a great deal of effort to push all 4 out in 2017 .

1 They get so much negativity because they 're awful films .

1 Let 's not embrace that

1 Except they had early screenings for elite critics from NYT , Whashington Post , Hollywood report , LA Times , etc . that all gave it a solid review and rated it as good summer blockbuster tha it is . Please inform your self before you post .

1 Wait ... how was Boondock Saints deep to begin with ?

1 His issue was that he thought Jack Nicholson was too crazy to play a man losing his sanity .

1 I would pay to watch you and OP debate who loved Birdman more for different reasons and who is more articulate without becoming obnoxiously overbearing .

1 RU-FI-OOOOOOOOO

1 It seems to be something intrinsic in any cultural mythos . I believe this is partly why the prequel star wars trilogy did n't touch people in the way the original trilogy did . While it was visually interesting to watch the Palpatine hurtle senate booths at Yoda , it did n't have the impact of Luke struggling just to pull his lightsaber from the ice in the wampa 's cave .

1 Hold on , just because someone paid for a ticket did n't mean they * enjoyed * the movie .

1 Oh , yeah , I do n't think * AVATAR * was brilliant as a film for other merits , I see it more as a technological marvel . However generic the story , I actually sat through about eight hours of its special features , and those were genuinely fascinating . I admire the technology and how it was used a lot more than the actual result .

1 Now we will all ~~go see the movie out of sheer curiosity~~ * catch it on Netflix in a couple months since we 've seen everything else new and worth watching . *

1 Visitor Q is hands-down the most fucked up movie I 've ever seen .

1 Does n't really negate anything I said . I look at the Oscar lists and think they all deserve to be there . That does n't mean there are n't other films / actors that I also think are worthy of a nod or two . The Academy would find themselves on an equally slippery slope if they just started nominating 'unknown ' films or actors over equally good mainstream potential nominees for the sake of it . For example , Michael B Jordan 's performance in Fruitvale Station was one of my favourites from last year , but , apart from maybe Leonardo DiCaprio , there 's no one from 2013 's Best Actor category that I could replace him with .

1 It 's a beautiful film , so I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it . Just do n't expect a brilliant story or the same kind of action as Alien 's .
