1 Wtf ?

1 If you note the rubber tips on the end its so he can walk like an ape and rest his 'knuckles ' on the ground when he moves

1 Yeah , the point of the test is not to determine if a film is sexist or not , or if it 's worth watching , it 's just something to keep in mind . Also , that comic was retarded .

1 No , Vangelis Papathanassiou is responsible for the tune . This guy wrote the film that Vangelis scored .

1 Agreed , after leaving the theater I was just stunned . The movie made me forget all about my cares and worries , such an amazing experience .

1 She just bleached them .

1 I do n't even own * a * gun .

1 It 's a comic book movie , that stayed true to the comics and had lots of little easter eggs for serious fans . The Avengers go around punching and blowing up bad guys . What were you expecting , Shakespeare ?

1 Nobody likes that movie for it to be overrated .

1 As a former projectionist , I can relate to making this mistake . I accidentally played Saw III instead of Santa Clause 3 . Pretty sure I scarred some children for life .

1 I actually think it could work , my only concern is that it seems like a Men In Black ripoff .

1 Yep because he was called `` Reld Man ' before .

1 surprisingly yes it does

1 I agree this one looks like a strike out but Midnight and Paris threw me off at first .

1 It airs on ABC . Which is owned by Disney .

1 It wo n't get off your mind for a while .

1 Freud would have something to say about it , to be sure .

1 The Princess Bride always seems like one , but fucking hell is n't it the best ?

1 wat

1 I read your comment like Shatner .

1 When I was a child , TBS was known as 'The Beastmaster Station ' . [ Tvtropes seems to agree with us too ] ( http : / tvtropes.org / pmwiki / pmwiki.php / Main / VindicatedByCable )

1 why do u have to be such a dick

1 The theatrical cut of Prometheus is the Directors cut . The only extended cut of the movie is unofficial and made by a fan putting all the released deleted scenes back in . And from an editing POV it made sense for Pietro Scalia to cut out most of those scenes .

1 The big Lebowski , man , same attention to details , so you can watch it 20 times and is always new .

1 Titanic got me ( as well ) but ROTK really , REALLY got to me . My poor wife had to deal with me in that state opening night in a Manhattan theatre . I was a complete wreck . So I guess Jackson did a good job . ( understatement )

1 That was n't Cuba Gooding Jr .

1 I remember this weird tradition , we 'd always have this one kid who , at the beginning of each episode , would read the disclosure ( the white text with the blue background ) and try to finish it before it faded away . Needless to say , he did it practically every time , and I still do n't know why to this day . Man , 4th grade was weird ... ...

1 More like a triumph for the box-office power of George Clooney .

1 I do n't get it .

1 So what ? OP just asked for a recommendation , not something completely under the radar .

1 I think she just need to watch a wigs range of `` old '' movies so she can get a grasp on the huge variations between decades , and even years

1 Sorry .

1 This is an instance where I can comfortably say that I do n't think you understood the intention of the movie . Like , at all .

1 Starring Kurt Russell ...

1 > like 2001 , * contact * , close encounters You do n't say ? : P

1 * Latrine ! * I watched it recently and it still holds up really well .

1 I do n't like this ending . It makes no sense whatsoever following the plot line of Dodgeball . It 's a slap in the face to the audience .

1 He 's the bartender .

1 Superman also could morph his face and became king of the world and was a huge super dick , golden age is shit .

1 I think she won the award because she gave a tremendously relatable and believable descent into madness and isolation . Not because she danced real pretty .

1 Yeah , I am lost , I thought that was the only way it was .

1 `` Now , eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour , right ? ''

1 So Walter White is gon na fight the aliens with blue meth ?

1 The only thing that I thought the hobbit got snubbed for was a nomination for makeup and hairstyling . I think some people completely take for granted how much effort goes into them movies

1 > re-defining what we see is Superman Seriously , I do n't know much of the lore but this is Superman like I 've never imagined before .

1 lol wut

1 If only they had a real street fighter movie poster to work from ...

1 It 's February , `` top 20 film of 2015 '' is n't exactly impressive . It could n't even crack the top 10 ... ?

1 There is a rumor that George P. Cosmatos did n't direct Rambo and that Stallone actually did . Cosmatos is also credited as director of Tombstone which Kurt Russel claims Cosmatos was actually just there to take credit and that Kurt actually directed it .

1 I have no memory of this trailer ! All I remember were some really short , really vague `` What is the Matrix ? '' teasers with a brief shot of the bullet-time dodge and that was enough to pique my interest . And honestly , that trailer you linked has got pretty much everything people are complaining about . There 's a shot from nearly every scene in the movie , it spoils the surprise of super-human abilities , of the `` virtual reality '' angle , the result of the helicopter scene , the major one-liners .

1 No laughs at all . Paranormal Activity was decent at the time it first came out , though people are just too * aware * these days to make it anything special . Blair Witch came around at the perfect time to catch everyone off-guard and I do n't think it will ever be topped . The `` found footage '' genre is beyond stale at this point .

1 They would have had to change the ending . I do n't think Hollywood would be blowing up buildings after 2001

1 My roommate and I were that crazy for TDKR . I do n't know how common that was .

1 Captain American Psycho

1 Comparing gay marriage to incest is n't a political view . We pretend it is because that kind of thing is said by a large segment of a political wing , but it 's not . It 's nothing more than a hateful insult .

1 Hobgoblin was awesome just because he was this criminal mastermind who seemed like a upgraded Green Goblin that nobody knew the identity of , and had numerous patsys take the fall for him anytime he found himself in a corner . I think it was between like 5-10 years in real life time before they revealed who Hobgoblin actually was .

1 oh , you just did n't understand it .

1 It 's supposed to be a combination of two of the most famous spaghetti western characters , Django and Ringo .

1 This has to be one of the most sexist comments I 've seen on here in a while .

1 I 've watched this at least 10 times .

1 Jarvis

1 Director makes a big difference example - Avatar

1 your mom is more fucked up than Paul Reubens or Michael Jackson if she hung the threat of molestation over you head as punishment .

1 Funfact : He actually wanted to go down to 100lbs for that role but they stopped him at 120 because of concerns for his health .

1 That was a great movie and Marv was the best story in it so ... dunno what you 're getting at .

1 That is a really good question . but you know some of the architectural items looks familiar from where SPOILER [ the nuclear `` device '' is held , maybe in a different room attached ] ( / spoiler )

1 http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=C_HdVrcL7rM

1 You 're fucking awesome , many thanks for doing this .

1 I 've taken my fair share of downvotes for criticizing Django in this sub . Of course , the definition of unpopular opinion is pretty reliant on the threads you spend time in .

1 Yep , it 's only `` stupid kids '' that make movies short . I thought BH6 was perfectly paced . Yeah , I wanted more , but it would have slowed down a very fast-paced film , possibly weakening the whole . Not everything has to be 150 minutes long .

1 NOT a good date movie . The girl I took was crying at the end .

1 Are ... are you saying he was n't good in Fifth Element ? Because if you are , you are wrong sir / ma'am .

1 Glad I could help !

1 It 's weird that something so small could bother you that much . It is literally one line .

1 This must be a troll post

1 His vein levels are OVER NINE THOUSAND

1 Yes .

1 And it totally rocked my 6 year old world . Even targeted at kids it was pretty heady .

1 I think they actually shot that , but it never made the cut . Telescope basement is what does it for me , both in the book and film . [ Not really spoilers past here , but sort of , so tagged ] ( # s `` I felt the ending in the book was framed a little differently in book and film , in the book it seems the people are more genuine- although the reader knows the nature of the world , and there is a strong possibility that the kid is now food ... The film however leaves it a little less ambiguous ( in my mind at least ) , the woman has something of a shit eating grin that is trying to project distrust by the filmmaker . '' ) Maybe I am looking at it wrong , but it is such a strain going through both texts again !

1 Ya , I 'm sick of every DC movie being dark , totally out of character for 99 % of their roster .

1 Arnold Squash-an-egger ? Edit : `` I know who I am . I 'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunshweiger . ''

1 I prefer the `` You owe it to me '' speech from that movie . http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=XOfFkVCdLQo

1 How had predator not been mentioned ?

1 So did the original Hugo novel .

1 `` Like an Eggar suit '' * giggle *

1 I am fully aware that this little enterprise cost me a million dollars last year . I expect to loose a million dollars this year . You know what Mr Thatcher , at a rate of a million dollars a year , I 'll have to close this place in Seventy years

1 Agreed . Time to hang up the black rubber !

1 I find this very strange behaviour from a TV director like Taylor . Not many directors get to ? graduate ? from TV and commercials ( like Abrams , Whedon and now Taylor ) . Some are stuck making them for life . Success is everything in Hollywood . Simplified if you happen to have your name on a film that made money you will get bombarded with job offers . If you do n't no-one is going to hire you for anything interesting or fund your own projects . Admirable that he 's sticking to his guns I suppose , but according to Whedon ( who has no qualms about badmouthing suits to the media like with Firefly ) working with Feige is amazing as he is a good producer who cares deeply about the projects , sets reasonable and consistent boundaries and lets the director take it from there . This is Taylor 's big break . He was lucky they needed a cheap director ASAP otherwise he might still be in TV and not have his name on a giant film that 's a guaranteed success . So long as the film doesn ? t suck he 's got it made . If I were him I 'd be treating Feige and the production really well .

1 That one was was sepia actually .

1 You 're right on about the douchey old school fans . Like I was saying earlier , if superhero fans were as bad as zombie fans they 'd be saying Spider-Man is n't a superhero because he does n't fly or wear a cape .

1 I wish with every new batman movie that the new batman would do something ridiculous like that . But noooo , it 's got ta be all hoarse yelling and drama lol

1 Could not agree any more !

1 Condominiums .

1 dum dum ... .. dum dum ...

1 Neil deGrasse Tyson with a wiffle ball bat .

1 They did . The budget came from product placement .

1 Looks like someone has a case of the frownies .

1 People can and will hate on the Final Destination series , but who can deny its originality ?

1 Usually you say which movie the spoilers are from , If you do n't only expect people that have seen all the movie ever released to click . It can also attract the people who did see the movie you want to talk about . It 's also the kind of post that is frequent in the sub . ; )

1 He 's been great on the Fargo TV show .

1 Am-scray , get lost kid , ya bugs me .

1 inside man

1 It 's every second though not every frame .

1 Just Dredd 2 .

1 Because , and Im trying to pull myself out of it , this had an actual narrative structure with humanizing and tangible story arcs , while Transformers is just garbage with zero consistency in character or tone or really anything . They 're some of the worst constructed stories , from a writing sense , that I have ever encountered on the big screen .

1 There are n't any good rips available yet , meaning anyone who wants to see it has to go to the cinema . Edit - Oh c'mon . I 'm just saying that piracy is obviously unlikely to have effected this particular movie 's box office sales in any meaningful way , because it 's non-existent .

1 I loved the scene [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` when they figure out the war wagon is on its way back '' ) , Doof just shrugs his shoulders and starts rocking out to get the war boys moving .

1 If it was , Jamie Lee Curtis would win every year .

1 [ Fabulous ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=dcqmvGVH9c0 & t=32s ) !

1 * Have fun storming the castle . *

1 January Jones was CRINGE-inducing .

1 Oh how I agree that this should have really been two films , but we really should be thankful for what we got . Unfortunately the target demographic which should have made this film a huge box office success just did not show up , and had this started as a two film project I can promise you we would have never gotten the second half . Thankfully the film we did get was a fairly complete film , it 's just too bad they had to compress so much . But at least the film for what it was was very well done .

1 > It 's like rather than trying to install a sense of pride in his powers , in teaching him that he could use them to help people , even at the cost of himself , he 's told to hide his powers . His father is seeing the bigger picture . It 's not `` Do n't save them because no one can know what you are . '' It 's `` Do n't choose to save them now because there will probably be more people that need saving in the future . '' Basically the needs of the world will outweigh the needs of that kid .

1 Uh , no . Ultimate Spider-Man had Peter Parker as the protagonist for 160 issues .

1 > They are nice rides if you turn off your brain for a few hours though . Somehow I do n't think the directors of either we 're trying to stir up discussion or make people think . All of the transformers films have been sub par because the action is n't particularly great . Pacific Rim however delivered above and beyond my expectations . If you wanted to watch something thought provoking you were pretty dumb to think that either film would provide that .

1 pineapple express by wes anderson , think it would be hysterically brilliant

1 I found it was very funny in `` X-men : The First Class '' though . If he got angry a sudden Irish accent appears !

1 [ Me after watching that ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / qkfZa.gif )

1 There was * just * a story about this . ( [ found it ] ( http : / blogs.indiewire.com / theplaylist / ron-perlman-still-pushing-for-hellboy-3-says-guillermo-del-toro-has-broad-strokes-of-story-mapped-out-20140619 ) ) Apparently Ron Perlman is still campaigning for it , and Del Toro already has it sort of planned out .

1 * Two beavers are better than one *

1 If people care that much about a search engine , that they 're letting it take away from the quality of what is actually a really good movie , they need to get their heads examined .

1 Or both . Who wants to read a rant complaining that a movie 's characters are flawed human beings who did n't live their lives perfectly ? `` This movie is flawed because all of the characters react in ways that I would not have . '' Well to hell with perfect movies then .

1 Nope . Not a coincidence . Nolan has always liked Batman , which is why he pursued it pretty hard when the opportunity came up to direct a Batman film . EDIT : On second thought , knowing Nolan , it was definitely foreshadowing .

1 I do n't think I 'm a jerk or obnoxious , I still respect the man 's work . [ This link has an Oscar nominated person . ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0951420 / ? ref_=tt_cl_t6 ) Actors got ta eat .

1 It was one of the earlier hollywood movies that dealt fairly frankly with sexuality - and also touched upon the generation gap somewhat - the idea of children questioning the ideals of their parents ' generation , where underneath the `` establishment American dream '' there was a lot of hypocrisy going on . Realize that in the 60 's - while there was a HUGE societal revolution going on , with drugs , premarital sex , the anti-war movement , etc , etc , the Hollywood films of that era pretty much stayed away from all that . And believe it or not , at that time , Simon & Garfunkel were considered to be really 'edgy ' and the soundtrack created a sensation . I would agree - in retrospect it is not the masterpiece it was once thought to be , but I think it has some good moments .

1 Great speech . Greatest living movie director .

1 Batman : Mask of the Phantasm was actually my favorite cinematic interpretation of Batman before Christopher Nolan 's trilogy - just a fantastic , beautifully animated film ( with just the right amount of creepiness and darkness ) . Plus , how can you not love Mark Hamill 's Joker ?

1 Hulk just wants to be left alone . He only fights when provoked , [ Black Widow was pointing a gun and she kept badgering Banner . I 'm sure the Hulk inside him caught wind of that before Banner was startled by the attack . ] ( / spoiler )

1 You could say that by letting the Sandy Hook shootings be the singular event that changed his mind on fictional violence in R rated films he is downplaying the tragedy of the innumerable acts of senseless violence which have occurred in the USA and around the world with frightening regularity .

1 Alien ?

1 And let 's not forget the movies that we do n't know of yet . I think that I had n't heard of half of the movies I liked in 2014 . You only get to know the big movies , i.e. sequels or movies from famous actors / directors .

1 & lt ; Detective Norman Stansfield

1 I HATED this movie the first time I saw . But after going back and watching again I really got it on another level and is now my favorite Shyamalan film . I had never thought before what would it be like to have superpowers beyond how cool it would be to fly .

1 As a reformed Catholic who saw this film for the first time when I * did * have faith , it makes the film 's impact even bigger . Latin prayer , possession , Satan , impending doom ... this is all stuff that I learned about every day for 10 years in Catholic school / occasional Sunday school . At the time , the subject matter was very real and , in the context of the film , truly terrifying .

1 So brave .

1 It seemed the perfect length to me . A great film that finished tied for first with 12 Years A Slave in my top ten .

1 You know , I think I have to go with this one . Birdemic ? Yeah it 's bad , but it 's amateur and it 's so bad it 's funny . The Room ? Same thing This movie though ? Oh man , this movie had money . They had talent , they had money , and they threw it all away . Not to mention , there is nothing funny about the movie . It 's just bad . Very bad . Awful . At least stuff like The Amazing Bulk has comedy going for it , this movie is just plain shit .

1 He boxed in some semipro matches iirc

1 It is circumventing the service which they offered you , and which you paid for . That you can circumvent and get more content by using weaknesses in the technology ( i.e. Internet having provider architecture ) , does n't mean that you do n't breach the service agreement . Netflix is primarily a third party content provider . They want to make as much content available as possible , but are restricted by the contents ' license owners . If your company makes a TV-show , you have the right to choose how to distribute that . For instance , you might get a good deal from a certain region that has specific interest in it , but they wish to buy exclusive rights to it . That means that you give up the less financially beneficial choice of licensing to Netflix for that region . This is n't really up to Netflix , and is an unfortunate and consumer-unfriendly aspect of the free market ( Just saying exclusive rights to media is forbidden has its negative consequences ) . If you wish that this were different , then some kind of reform needs to be done . I 'm not sure how that could be possible . Bottom line is : you paid for a subscription that has certain terms and limitations . Circumventing it because you can , does n't mean doing so is getting `` more out of the deal '' , it 's going beyond it , and Netflix most surely is pressured by its third party license owners to make sure Netflix are following their regional restriction agreements . Tl : dr ; you are wrong , but I wish you were n't .

1 Whatever , dude , that movie fucking rocked .

1 they had violence , just it happened every time the camera man got a seisure

1 > M . Night Shyamalan 's new Movie Title gives away the ending to his new movie . FTFY

1 Why do n't you just stop watching found footage movies ?

1 One of my favorite movies almost no one has seen .

1 Right where I 'd put mine .

1 Not terribly high . There 's a perception that sequels make up most Hollywood releases because they do well at the box office , but the majority of movies released each year are not sequels . Established franchises are just more visible and overrepresented by advertising and the like .

1 I 'm pretty sure [ this ] ( http : / xhamster.com / movies / 2266940 / emily_koo_stark_softcore.html ) is the porn in question . Her wiki article says the rest , so take that with a grain of salt . Obviously , NSFW Edit : Clarification

1 I might even throw in that the Elves knew full well what happens when they die ; they dwell with Mandos ( One of the Valar ) till the end times , whereas no one in Middle-Earth knows what happens when men die . I know what Gandalf would say ; `` Many that live deserve death . Some that die deserve life . '' Who can really say which was the greater sacrifice ?

1 He was amazing in Before the Devil knows you are dead

1 Please name at least a few of those thousand so I can watch them . I love this movie and could watch it on repeat all day .

1 That 's sad and hilarious .

1 They are probably basing this off Ultimate FF then where everyone is like 17-20 years old

1 yeah he was , its one of my favorite movies ... I just believe if he ever had an oscar performance it was in catch me if you can

1 Still in better shape than all of us .

1 Galaxy Quest

1 I agree . It was very unsettling in a couple of ways . Excellent movie .

1 I highly recommend everyone to check this out . It was only limited release but the chemistry between Hill , Reilly , and Tomei is outstanding .

1 Meh .

1 I disagree about Avatar mostly because it 's a scifi movie with a ton of special effects . Science fiction movies rarely do well at the Oscars . Now if you take the same plot and put it in a more Oscar-friendly setting , like let 's say , 1860s America , you get Dances with Wolves , which was Oscar bait , yet also a great movie .

1 Sean Penn was n't in reservoir dogs . Do you mean Chris Penn ?

1 could n't agree on compensation

1 Maybe if the Kraken was on screen for more than 12 seconds .

1 I think they were trying to kill it with X3 and Wolverine : Origins ...

1 Eva Green-naked in all her movies

1 Yes , HAL is only the perfected version of the bone stick .

1 Saying that comedies are more subjective than any other genre is pretty subjective .

1 Whedon had a hand in Toy Story , too , and I guess it did OK . He talks about Alien Resurrection ( and what went badly ) in this [ interview ] ( http : / www.gointothestory.com / 2009 / 01 / interview-joss-whedon.html ) if anyone is interested . * edited to clarify what Whedon was talking about .

1 You got it !

1 Absolutely fantastic advice , I completely agree .

1 Was n't Jenny on drugs too ? Sharing needles and boning everyone ? That 's possible .

1 You 're not .

1 interesting choice of words

1 ... ..I heard `` Hi David ''

1 RUN HOME JACK

1 Or a seboot if you 're nasty .

1 Well , the petition is for the character Machete , right ?

1 Liam Neeson ... as all the Rangers

1 This is already happening , a lot of movies are taking the Chinese market into consideration especially . Looper was an example where I believe the script was actually changed to incorporate China , and that 's going to become common it seems .

1 Sadly I think it was produced just a tiny bit before it would have had a bigger market . Today I think it would be huge

1 Right now I 'm the powder keg and you 're the fuse . If you tell me to * junk it * one more time ...

1 You 're assuming they only started on the script after it was announced at ComiCon ? Because no .

1 the hints at the cartel stuff was a weak way to make it vaguely interesting , otherwise its just about two best friends .

1 Apparently he is up for a role in the film , not Dr . Strange though .

1 It 's the issue with the way the story was told . All of the hobbit and a good portion of LOTR were written as a story from Bilbo and Frodo , so were treated to pretty close to an unreliable narrator .

1 * every girl in the club *

1 The sequel , although not as good , was a fantastic allegory for the war in Iraq ( civilian casualties , post 9 / 11 paranoia , etc . ) . Plus the opening sequence was shot incredibly well .

1 I do n't think it got good reviews ... I saw it . It 's totally forgettable .

1 IIRC , it 's even more anticlimactic in the book . There 's a bright light that illuminates the room , burning the goblins . When everything returns to normal , the Goblin King has been beheaded and the group is on the run .

1 And the band he was in with Dave Barry , Amy Tan and Barbara Kingsolver .

1 I honestly think nobody knows who will direct Bond 24 at this point , it seems even from this article that there could be contenders , but it seems that people are just throwing out names at this point ( the Variety article attached said they added Tom Hooper , Shane Black and Ang Lee to the potential list ) it probably wo n't be long until we hear rumors of Michael Bay , Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese among others being `` potentials '' for the helm .

1 that 's because he is so tall

1 Goddamnit now I have to go watch the whole thing again .

1 I think Mark Wahlburg is the best serious-to-comedy actor . I only became a fan of him after his ( intentionally ) goofy side started to shine .

1 Exactly my thought . Though I did think Karl Urban and Lena Headey did great jobs in their roles . But yes it 's a movie that is n't trying to pretend to be an Oscar nominee or have a deep plot . It just does it 's best to pull of cool shots and make them look even cooler and it does a hell of a job with it .

1 Thanks for the 39 week old news article .

1 Actually that makes him even more awesome . Watching him play that character on full house for so long and then seeing him in half baked was like the funniest thing ever

1 He prefers Dwayne Johnson . Technically the name The Rock is still owned by WWE

1 Damn . You showed them .

1 That 's not a definite no . Fox owns the rights but Disney has the money they could throw around to get those rights . It 's very possible that a negotiation could be reached .

1 No . Chiming in . Looks mediocre at best .

1 or love triangles

1 No .

1 I mean , I recently rewatched the original trilogy in the laserdisc print ( so , effectively the theatrical release ) , and aside from the general image quality , and some of the minor fixes ( the orange blob under the speeder , the slightly transparent cockpits in the Battle of Hoth , etc . ) , I ca n't really see any advantage to * any * of the changes , including the CGI dogfights . That scene always felt a little odd in Vader 's stoicism , but I do n't think that putting a clumsy dub over it solves anything .

1 That hurt to read

1 I thought so too , but then i read it again , and i see that / u / mabelleamie is right . The reason he got a fact about childrape is because it was a random fun fact , not a correction .

1 Either way , being nominated gave him a lot of credibility so he 's got that going for him ! I 'm sure he 's not too bummed out .

1 The movie is a pastiche of film noir crime films . It is meant to be tongue in cheek ; they are n't talking like `` intelligent high schoolers '' , they are talking like 1940 's detectives . The scene when JGL stands up in his principal 's office and says `` If you want write me up or suspend me ! '' is a send up of scenes of renegade cops and their superior officers . The movie works best if you allow a bit of humor and critique / satire of that other genre to seep in ; the fact that they play it all straight faced instead of winking at the audience about what they are doing muddles that for some . That 's just my take on the film and my disagreement with your assessment , but of course it 's personal taste and you like or dislike whatever you want = ) Your parenthetical is a bit hostile though , and I 'd hate to see you downvoted for that when you are perfectly entitled to voice your dissent on a popular film .

1 Content is only a small part to the karma game . Title plays a huge role , as does subreddit selection and time of day .

1 reddit 's good for little niche subreddits to have some discussion . it 's the flogs out on the front page that irritate everyone with their epic le memes

1 To me conjuring had one master scene ( the girls in the bed room looking at something unseen behind the door ) . This scene was increibly well done , my expectatiosn shot up . The rest of the movie was pretty bland . Once they showed the witchy makeup person , I was completely done .

1 You mean `` Ah sayd , puht , duh bunneh , bahk ihn thuh bahx . ''

1 Ouch . As good as I thought Paltrow looked in the trailer , she looks that bad in the poster .

1 Well I apologize . Asking 'how old are you ? ' came off to me snarky and dickish . If it was an honest question , then I 'm sorry .

1 Fuckin ' Percy

1 What am I not tuuurtly enough for the turtle club ?

1 We could n't if we tried .

1 I know ! So perfect . And I love the way Reiner gives away the fate of one of the characters in like the second shot of the movie , when he lets us read the newspaper headline , but it 's subtle enough so that we just kind of store it away in our heads but forget about it for the next hour and a half .

1 now that we have entered the age of the hipster you 're automatically a douchebag for having an opinion ... .apparently .

1 I would n't call it trite . I would call it dramatic . Which it is , but for me , it works .

1 I think the problem with that movie was more with the writing / director

1 Gattaca . Quite good .

1 He literally says to Jor El he 'd rather kill all life on the planet than face a painful adaptation process like Kal had to . That 's downright fucking evil .

1 As is so often the case . . . the book is better .

1 I have never had that problem . I can enjoy a 1950s black and white movie just as much as an HD-quality movie from last year . Content always counts more than flashy special effects or production . Would you rather listen to Pink Floyd on vinyl or Britney Spears in HD-audio ? I find most 20 and under people to fall victim to the flash over substance , and Hollywood knows this . Michael Bay made a career out of it with his Transformers movies .

1 It 's not even to do with the amount of free time people have , not everyone is twelve . People will have grown up seeing those films in the cinema or renting them from the now closed video store or seeing them on the tv ( the majority of those will have been on tv ) . They 're good films but most people are happy having seen them just once .

1 We 've been watching a lot of 80s movies but I totally forgot how good the 90s were for movies too . I think I watched the Mighty Ducks every weekend for at least 3 months . It 's a nice little treat to watch those movies again , it 's like reliving your childhood for 90 minutes at a time .

1 BAM , nailed it .

1 Agreed . It makes me uncomfortable to look at it .

1 He was using palladium in the first movie , too . There 's a scene showing him and Yinsen disassembling missiles in order to get enough of it to run the arc-reactor . The Mark 1 chest-unit needed 1.6 grams in order to work . The amount of Palladium used in the Mark 2 unit ( the one that Tony built after returning from Afghanistan ) was never established . According to [ this page , ] ( http : / www.chemicool.com / elements / palladium.html ) Palladium costs $ 1571 per 100g , which means that the 1.6g used in the arc reactor would cost roughly $ 25 .

1 I feel the same about Casablanca .

1 Your right . I loved the characters because they were the only way for me to get the answers to everything else on the show .

1 Epcot , drink around the world .

1 In the book , those are the bones of the father of `` Moonwatcher '' , the apeman who was the first to touch the Monolith . Clarke put that in to show how early Man had absolutely no concept of family or life itself .

1 Oh man how I wish the Harlem Globetrotters had been in Girl With a Dragon Tattoo

1 Tarantino said in an interview that for Inglorious Basterds he thought he had written an unplayable character - until he met Waltz .

1 I want to see The Neighbors as well : s

1 Of course it is fake . Do you have any idea how many health codes would be violated by smearing BLOOD all over another person 's face ? Fuck no .

1 Bold . A nearly silhouetted figure from behind with a panorama of destruction ...

1 But 'No More ' is the emotional crux ( in tandem with 'No One is Alone ' . ) It 's THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE SHOW .

1 I do . However this film makes no qualms about being a bit pretentious , and the theatrical release is NOT what many critics saw ( the original cut is much longer and much sloppier ? it may have fared a fair bit better with some editing beforehand ) . At any rate , I talk this movie up to my friends who like Tarkovsky and Kubric . I do * not * talk about it around my buddies who think X-Men and Iron Man are the epitome of film . To each their own I say ? both types of sci fi have their merits , but Southland Tales deserves more love .

1 You mean hes vulnerable , not immune .

1 Yup . It 's called [ spaghettification ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Spaghettification ) .

1 It should n't detract . I mean its a true story so being spoiled is almost to be expected . It should n't affect it at all . I knew the ending before I sat down and I still loved Argo .

1 That may be a Pyrrhic victory .

1 As opposed to the story of `` hit the bad guys with the glowy stick '' ? Star Wars is an iconic series because it took the Hero 's Journey , attached a bunch of scifi and medieval elements to it in a genius fashion ( lightsabers are a great way to have personal combat in the future , which we generally consider impersonal , filled with guns and blasters that kill `` honorable '' combatants ) and put it out there in a format accessible to just about everyone . It 's not some hugely complicated , labyrinthine story .

1 Not yet , sadly . He 's working on it though . Look at the gap between the release of the first two .

1 It is .

1 It is because the projection of a 65mm is superior than a digital one right now . However if they projected digitaly in 6k or 10k you would have a superior digital projection .

1 I 've seen the LOTR extended cuts 3 times and been overdue for a re-watch . When the credits started rolling on the last Hobbit movie - the only thing I could think was that I will never watch these movies again . That was a sad feeling .

1 This would have been the go-to if it was on instant .

1 Pink Floyd 's The Wall

1 From Dana Gould 's Twitter : 'I have n't seen `` Extremely Loud And Incredibly Close '' , but I assume it 's a documentary about talking to drunk people . '

1 * shhtoree

1 > Ron Perlman His showing up in Drive absolutely ate up the scene . Completely dominated with his presence .

1 You think Burn After Reading is a bad movie ?

1 I dunno if you 're assuming a perfect solid rectangle . I would think there would be some under-counter space , maybe some shelves , that might affect the count .

1 This really isnt a 'new ' thing . Iran has been a huge foreign policy issue since ... well , since they took over our embassy . And from what I can tell its not super political .

1 What the hell , man ?

1 Hudson was awesome , but ladies love Hicks . ; )

1 Its definitely best to appreciate Aliens for the sci-fi action romp that it is . Not a very scary movie , nor does it rank high on the intelligence scale , but it is great considering all the cool shit that happens and all of the space marine tropes that were born from it .

1 They 've already stated it 's based on WarCraft I .

1 Reminds me of James Dean . The dude starred in 3 movies , each were nominated for multiple Academy Awards , and had a profound effect on pop culture , despite only living for 24 years .

1 I thought Predators turned out rather glorious , largely because they completely ignored Predator 2 's existence .

1 Nah

1 Typical OP .

1 He is generally very deadpan mixed with the lovable oaf . His characters are n't trying to be funny . He is n't trying to tell jokes . He is usually straight man put in a weird situation .

1 The music really made Bane feel like a brute force . The Joker 's music played with your mind a lot , which is what the Joker did . Bane 's music was just brutal and really made me terrified of him .

1 if i make a product , the patent is up in 14-20 years . why does a song deserve 90 years ?

1 You 'll have to ask one of mods about that , I did n't actually make the images

1 It 's a quick read if that makes a difference . Took me about two days

1 When you love someone like your mom and I used to ...

1 We watched it as kids , on edge for a hour waiting for a punch line . We just could n't believe there was an Adam Sandler movie a 10 year old kid could n't laugh at

1 Above all else I value silence ; the near-constant coughing and candy wrapper crinkling of the typical theater kills the mood for me . Then there are the little kids and babies . My God , the babies . Also , when watching a movie at home I can scratch my balls .

1 I would have gone with `` You brought two too many '' but yours works . http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=juwwCTBZOCQ & feature=youtube_gdata_player Actually , the whole open to that movie is a long awesome fuck you to modern editing .

1 Since when has nerd culture ever not been insulted . I seem to remember watching Revenge of the Nerds growing up .

1 I believe it is because the major cost in releasing a film to theaters , after advertising , is shipping the physical film to the location . Not simply freight , but it 's got to be licensed and insured and handled specially or something . Not sure where the theaters are on progressing to digital projectors , but if they all switched over it would make things much cheaper .

1 The problem with this is that it 's so vague it applies to any and all possible criticism .

1 Man you 're like an internet superhero .

1 I think it 's safe to say that docking scene was the cinematic peak of the film .

1 Uh , negative . I 'm a meat popsicle .

1 I could n't stop laughing at the confessional scene . `` And he killed my sister . '' `` The one with the club foot ? '' `` Yes . '' `` Those fuckers ! ''

1 In a nutshell : atrocious acting , terrible coverage , terrible direction , terrible execution of a concept , horseshit twist , student-filmmaking level production quality .

1 The Dollars trilogy : * Fist full of Dollars * A few Dollars more * The good the bad and the ugly

1 Book is awesome , highly recommended it .

1 You deserve more credit for this .

1 Those are only two guys . Even then ; Denzel movies do n't blow up the box office like they used too and Will Smith was on top for a few years before the MCU blowing up thrust more white actors atop the box office mountain .

1 There is an infinite number of ways to `` explore '' the * blowing shit up * theme . You are not well versed in action films are you ?

1 How does someone make a video comparing one of the most famous stoner movies ever to Alice In Wonderland and not bring up the Hookah smoking caterpillar ?

1 Yeah , you just have to walk out of your screening and walk directly into the next one you see .

1 They needed you in the writers ' room . Instead they just said , `` ah jump scare and done . Let 's get lunch ! ''

1 With you on Foxcatcher . Carrel looks to be a powerhouse in that film .

1 I concur . The resolution of the ... I guess 'science ' of the film was something I never needed in Donnie Darko . The original version is one of my favourite films in part because of the accidentally open ending which everyone could interpret their own way . When you 're having to put literal pages from a book onto the screen in order to explain what the hell is going then you 've got problems . If Kelly 's career since has proved anything it 's that Dornie Darko is a beautiful fluke of a movie .

1 She 's worried about accumulating too many engrams . Or whatever

1 Dude ... Wrath of Khan was * Moby Fucking Dick * for crying out loud . It 's absolutely shameful what they did with the reboot .

1 Nope . Most people advertise the boring way , they go to chat shows and talk about how great it was to work on the movie then show a trailer . For this movie , they 've got the character going to chat shows and doing adverts instead . After watching him on Conan I realized they 've actually got a Ron Burgundy book coming out as all . You get much more jokes this way and the movie is still to come !

1 Will check it out . Thanks for watching ... and Akira is great .

1 Gremlins was the way I learned there was no Santa . When that old lady flies out the window on her motor chair scared me shitless when I was little . Now I just laugh at that scene . Gremlins was just too awesome of a movie for my child brain to handle .

1 Goddammit this has moved on to gif form .

1 Hawaiian , if I recall . [ EDIT : Yep , Hawaiian , born in Lebanon . ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0000206 / )

1 First thought that entered my mind .

1 Bilbatello

1 If it 's not R , it 's not Deadpool . Simple as that .

1 At his funeral . Yes .

1 Killer Croc looks pretty dope . I know DC / WB gets a lot of shit here for trying to make all their universe `` dark and gritty '' but as a lifelong fan of DC and Marvel it will be refreshing to see them in two contrasting styles . Killer Croc would for sure be CGI mocap character if it was a Marvel movie .

1 `` No ''

1 It was a pipe-bomb , not dynamite . `` Frank the bombs worked ! The bombs they really worked ! ''

1 I would love to see a horror / drama employ a similar style of giant demon .

1 The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe ?

1 That film is torture .

1 You also realize why most movies are not in first person , its disorienting and a small % of the audience would probably get motion sickness .

1 Quit being such a melvin .

1 No Mecha-Godzilla . I judge your statement false .

1 Akira '13 was an outside job !

1 That 's central London prices , if you venture out a ways the prices will be much cheaper . That applies to almost everything

1 Yeah , it 's the greatest story ever toad .

1 Both are really only honorary Rogues though , the title is n't adopted until after the Battle of Yavin . Episode IV distinctly calls them Red Squadron .

1 Click is very hit or miss . The humor is still very much Adam Sandler , I did n't find myself chuckling at much of any of the jokes . A very good story though , and one I definitely wo n't be forgetting soon .

1 Am I the only one who though of Kubrick style directing while watching this film . Nicolas Winding-Refn is probably the greatest and underrated director around right now .

1 Top 5 Sean Bean death .

1 Sean Connery didnt win -- he just competed .

1 [ i 'm not even supposed to be here today ! ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / TCje94d.jpg )

1 Well that 's just whoring an idea rather than adding another chapter to a story .

1 I will never forget watching that scene from The Other Guys in the theater with my buddies . You only get that drawn out , magical `` wait , what the fuck are they doing ? '' feeling once .

1 It just does n't make a bit of sense .

1 Believe me when I say they tried . Unfortunately , they do their homework when you apply for a .edu

1 Hugh Hackman as big boss Christain bale as grey wolf Unknown or cgi 'd Hugh as snake Make two films covering metal gear 's 1-2 . The reason being that Kojima has already `` filmed '' every other game . The two NES games are perfect time periods as they have gotten the least amount of attention . Who would n't want to see Batman and Wolverine fighting hand to hand in a minefield ?

1 Also : Fox News

1 He can certainly hate whoever he likes and others can hate him for that . He can be a homophobe is he likes and people can avoid the work of a homophobe if they like .

1 I fucking love MacGruber , Will Forte is hilarious .

1 The public was led to believe that Bruce died in the riots . Only Gordon , Alfred , and Blake knew who he was .

1 Dude . When the rohirrim come over the hill , with the sunshine , up until they hit the orc army is fucking epic . Gets my blood pumping .

1 He knows his place in the movie world . It 's refreshing .

1 Noone said he ever did `` smart '' comedies , but his early movies [ and a few of his later ones ] were actually genuinely funny and enjoyable .

1 Nope . Either A ) Fuck off or B ) Read your own fucking link .

1 Well it 's not even nominated for writing or anything , just some technical awards

1 Yes , we should n't discuss movies that we do n't like here

1 I 'm confused , that 's what he said .

1 How many original shots are we going to get in zero gravity ? It 's like saying the shot of John Travolta walking in Pulp Fiction was a nod to Stayin ' Alive .

1 Completely agree with you , though I liked the movie 's atmosphere .

1 I regret I do n't have any suggestions ; however , I just wanted to say what you 're planning is extremely thoughtful , which is something I wish more people were in general . Best wishes in your quest to find a suitable film !

1 I thought that was the best though . It always felt awkward that the kids had to be somewhere close to the digimon during their big final battles , with them in their strongest forms . Tamers though , it was like the perfect unification between partners . Though I can never get over how stupid Galantmon sounded .

1 It 's both ... Bond originally battles against SMERSH agents and many classic films with SPECTRE villains have SMERSH ties in the novels instead ( From Russia With Love , Doctor No , etc ) . Starting in Thunderball though SMERSH has basically been disbanded and Bond 's new antagonists are SPECTRE .

1 Time for my face to your foot technique .

1 `` Yippee Kay-Yay , Motherfucker ! '' `` I have n't seen that film . '' That was the high point of the movie .

1 Convict Conditioning .

1 I 'd be lying if I said I 've made it through the whole movie without crying .

1 Has n't everyone learned to accept that Marvel 's comic books know that they 're just imitating the films , and DC is just doing whatever , not even imitating the comic books ?

1 They 're not eccentric , they 're a all relevant and still used in projection

1 Anything by Kubrick

1 I understood it as a 'love letter ' of sorts to Georges M ? li ? s . From [ Wiki ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Georges_M % C3 % A9li % C3 % A8s # Later_film_career_and_decline ) - After being driven out of business , M ? li ? s disappeared from public life . By the mid-1920s he was making a meager living as a candy and toy salesman at the Montparnasse station in Paris .

1 That 's incredibly appropriate .

1 Shut the fuck up Donny

1 Yea ? Well go back and love 'im

1 But I took a torrent to the external hard drive .

1 Even if you did n't like Casino Royale ( if that 's even possible ) , the Bourne series are amazing films in general and are worth checking out .

1 Twitter , Netflix , Facebook and the Internet , in general , can provide the more useful `` word of mouth '' effect . But that 's my opinion . I do n't need Hollywood voters telling me what to watch .

1 It 's because he 's high . That 's it . Ever eaten an edible before ? Everything is either hilarious or terrifying and there 's no way of knowing what will be what .

1 So he was n't too good for it at all , he played the role with too much confidence . Meaning he was n't a good fit for the part .

1 One * good * one anyways .

1 I hope you 've watched it since . If not , you should .

1 I honestly do not know how that would be possible . I can not imagine what would be involved in writing a script for it . And that book messed me up so bad I do n't think I would ever get near a movie adaptation of it . I had the weirdest feeling that someone was looking over my shoulder the whole time I was reading it .

1 I 'm pretty sure that 's the white bits glowing .

1 I 've heard it 's almost 3 hours of nothing .

1 Ohh , good one

1 Guardians of Gahoole has the terrible flaw of being boring .

1 Do you know why W.S . Gilbert was frequently drunk on his trans-Atlantic crossings ? Because he was quartered on the * PORT * side ! LOL ! Now that I 've got you , let 's revisit the birth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company .

1 Anything made by Bernard Hermann like the theme for Hitchcock 's Psycho , Orson Welles ' Citizen Kane , etc . Also Anton Karas ' theme for Carol Reed 's The Third Man . I loved The Artist and I love that theme music !

1 Peter did n't fly very much , it was Rocket who was doing most of the flying outside while everyone else was fighting on the Black Aster .

1 I could be wrong but I think he 's talking about the horror movie

1 The movie or Deakins shooting it ? The movie ok I can understand that but Deakins shooting it I would have to say yes yes you are a crazy person and the only one who thinks that he should n't do it . He could make paint drying look gorgeous .

1 I 'm curious what gives you the impression that this is new .

1 The movie is almost completely different from the book .

1 I included a couple that reflect similar conceptual designs , just for fun .

1 The Mortal Instruments : City of Bones started as Harry Potter fanfiction I think . That came out sometime last year .

1 Or you need to re-evaluate how fucking inconsiderate you are to people around you who have * paid money * to be in a theatre watching a movie .

1 First one was scifi meets horror , second was scifi meets action , third was `` let 's try and repeat # 2 but with out any of what made it special '' , fourth was a valiant attempt to try something new .

1 Technically that 's how a lot of stories are written . You know the basic outline but as your creating stuff in between it all things start to take a `` life '' of it 's own sometimes . Idk if this is the case though .

1 Saw Watchmen with my mom so I know the feeling bro .

1 It was originally a post on Tumblr , and had been reblogged and a different person added that sentence .

1 Where ?

1 it 's a gray area

1 That is quite possibly one of the worst scenes I 've ever seen . Good god almighty it was straight trash .

1 The Anthology came out before Youtube so it was pretty rad to have those music videos .

1 Robbed ! I liked The Artist , but the silent movie aspect that made it win best picture just seemed like a huge Gimmick . The Descendants was the true best picture of that year , the best Clooney has ever been

1 Umm ... no . It was `` A long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away '' .

1 Matthew Mcconaughey

1 It would be a wise casting choice , he is one of the few , if not the only one who could pull off an amazing MM

1 Kinda failed to read the no pixar part , huh ?

1 This reminds me of Iron Sky , which needs to release in more places .

1 Trick question : Lemmy * is * God

1 Awwwwkward

1 Nah .

1 In a word . Badass .

1 Well the franchise is owned by Paramount : ) I am glad to see them all there : )

1 * Training Day * .

1 I honestly thought it was going to be a monster movie : / I was thouroughly disappointed .

1 Yep . Did that the day before I watched Boyhood . It was a good time .

1 And the look on Lemmon 's face when Baldwin just crushes the shit out of him verbally with his `` Put that coffee down '' thing . And Lemmon fucking does .

1 Considering American History X is about the horrors of racism and moving away from it I would pretty damn OK with them financing it .

1 Best movie I have seen in a long while . To me it had a real Big Lebowski vibe going on , but a little darker . Really self-aware and cheeky .

1 The wrestler ? https : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Bill_DeMott

1 You guys are the tldr of these comments .

1 Dat opening scene ...

1 Hey I watched that on TV yesterday !

1 The oatmeal wrestling did n't hurt either .

1 What the fuck else are they going to do ?

1 We could say the same about his sex life .

1 never underestimate a fanboy

1 I 've seen both . Dawn is the better movie by far .

1 Life imitates art ?

1 Cruella DeVoldemort

1 Saw it today , great hockey movie , Alison Pill looking hot as always , felt bad for Glatt throughout though , he seemed to be too `` simple '' , for lack of a better term .

1 Looks a lot like that nanosuit from crysis

1 Where did you get this information from ? - Brad Pitt - Kevin Spacey - Zach Grenier - Jared Leto - Rooney Mara - Andrew Kevin Walker - Paul Schulze Just a handful of many people who have worked with Fincher two or more times .

1 Uh , no ... I think they were trying to make a fun movie . What the succeeded in doing was make a bad , ironically funny movie . Yes , Transformers 2 was bad . But it was Michael Bay bad . That 's like a whole other lever of bad . Some bad movies are n't funny .

1 It 's mostly interview footage mixed with photos from crime scenes . Listen to it on the side while you do something else , the interview is very interesting and it 's one of my favorite documentaries . Even if you do n't see the movie this interview is great by itself .

1 You may be surprised , within certain sects ( i.e `` stoner stereotypes '' ) Hunter S. Thompson has a pretty solid cult following in the 18-24 y / o demographic , at least from what i 've seen .

1 Sorry for the misquote . I 'm a little drunk .

1 I 'm right there with you . I think they could have spaced out the Smallville battle and Metropolis battle a bit more , but it was awesome to see Superman have to handle that much happening at once . Zod and Feora were fantastic .

1 Wyldstyle : here they are , show 's over !

1 We don ' take to kinly to good movies 'round here .

1 If you look carefully - you can see Garfield 's left eye behind the mask .

1 Every time I order from Roy Rogers I want to end with that instead of `` thanks . ''

1 Up until that last sentence , I was positive that you were lying . My apologies .

1 Smaller relative to what ? If we want Rapture to truly come alive , I ca n't see how that would be possible on a low budget .

1 You know it 's shady when most religions are begging you to join but this one wants you to pay to get in .

1 Dude I was n't trying to be rude . Calm down .

1 She did n't know where the kids were , the man who is probably on heroin or something ( I assume cause he slept through her entire frantic rambling ) And in his annoyance at the young toddler 's crying , he tied them up , gagged them and put them into the closet , and nodded off and did n't come through until he realized the police were there .

1 What a bunch of a-holes .

1 > Actually the US has way more lenient age restrictions than the UK . No they do n't , not necessarily anyway . Depends on your age and whether you have strict parents or not . As a fellow UK-arian I 've noticed that most of the films that get made R in the US for mild sex reasons alone are rated 15 ( if not even 12a ) in the UK . So despite children being able to see films up to R with their parents in the US ; in the UK those same children wo n't need to get their parents to take them to see the movie because it was certified at a lower classification . The main difference is that in the US you can go see any movie should you be accompanied by your parents provided it 's not NC-17 . So you are only restricted to the degree that your parents will allow and probably more so by requiring their presence ( which is not always convenient ) . Arguably that is more restrictive than the UK as a 15 year old in the US can not go see an R on their own , while in the UK the movie is probably rated 15 meaning they could . There 's lots of factors and variables but in the UK I feel there is more autonomy involved . Basically it 's shit in the UK if you 're 13-14 years old , but it is only better in the US if you have cool parents that will take you to any movie you want .

1 Best movie you can try is Dr Strangelove since it 's a comedy .

1 Some of the films I see mentioned by others would n't have been on this list by definition . This list explicitly says it 's the 20 best foreign films * of the decade * . Which rules out all films prior to 2000 . ( and after 2009 , since that was the year the list came out )

1 I ? m sorry man , but I am with the people on this one .

1 you cant blame the man for blowing off the media . its bullshit .

1 [ Op forgot the link ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/IAmA / comments / 1x6q4r / matt_damon_ama / )

1 I was thinking that too . It 's not horrible , but I have 0 interest in seeing it again . Acting was pretty bad , the cgi looked fake in parts , and the story was forgettable .

1 Oh they 're both so lovely are n't they ! Their voices wash over me like a soothing cup of tea .

1 Nah . The new trailer is two minutes long and has new footage . Also , this is a very old video .

1 You make some good points , but they are clouded by immature outrage .

1 I do n't think Bond gives a shit about gun safety

1 FUCK ! ! ! I mean NO !

1 Fair points . Again , I 'd point to the writers behind each film and embrace the difference in talent between a Kadsan / Arndt screenplay and a Roberto Orci / Alex Kurtzman screenplay . Abrams , like you said , is a talented director . I believe more in the story that 'll be crafted behind him that 'll allow his talents to bloom .

1 Nope , episode 1 trailer was epic ( sadly film did not live up to it ) , the episode vii teaser was just that , shirt and sweet .

1 Thats The Rock from high school so that 's him at age 17-18 .

1 [ This ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / mqteb / what_is_the_most_disturbing_movie_youve_watched / ) was posted yesterday , pretty much what you 're looking for .

1 Except for the crappy Venom design ( why show Topher 's face ) , I thought it was a really good movie . Loved emo Parker

1 3 people for 100 pounds ? lol

1 It 's not meaningless , it 's misdirection .

1 I really appreciate him for turning down the money so I can remember his batman the way I want to .

1 I wondered where that sentence was going ...

1 Stop multiplying !

1 That was when he won me over . Not because he did n't enjoy his stay in China , but because he was so candid .

1 He might still - The Star Trek franchise has survived changes in director before , be might stay on as a producer for example . Even if he left entirely its not necessarily a bad thing .

1 It belongs in a museum !

1 cinematic masterpiece . one that 2014 will be remembered for .

1 Yeah sitting through all seven hours was tough . It 's a very slow film about a Russian collective farming community and their plans to sell off their land . If you like the works of Andrei Tarkovsky then check it out . It 's broken up into distinct chapters so you have the ability to come and go if you want .

1 In all fairness , that was four years before . It 's not like they turned him down after writing one of the best X-Men runs ever .

1 Ill vote for you

1 I know , that 's the impossible part .

1 The point of * Moneyball * was n't `` data rules everything , '' it 's that innovation and creativity trumps conventional thinking . The big franchises in MLB had money . Billy Bean did n't . He only had data . So he used it to his advantage and rubbed their noses in it . * Trouble with the Curve * is surprisingly similar . The tables have turned . Data is now king , so the big franchises rely on what the computer spits out . Eastwood 's character represents experience and wisdom , which will go head-to-head against the * new * conventional thinking .

1 You do realize that ! = and ? mean the same thing ? Only the latter being the mathematical symbol , and thus more universally used . Was n't trying to be a dick , nor did it warrant a dickish response .

1 YES . Just by that alone shows how swell of a guy Superman is .

1 A sensible comment ? ! GTFO .

1 If you do n't like the franchise , why did you click on a thread about it ?

1 I hope this was a copypasta otherwise I feel sorry that you went to all this length just to look like a dumbass .

1 DiCaprio same nasal voice ? Have you seen Blood Diamond ? Catch Me If You Can ?

1 Yeah , I 've been using instantwatcher.com for some time , it does pretty much the same thing . What would be great , though , is if Netflix Netflix would give us a real `` new '' section so that we would n't have to rely on external sites .

1 Keeper

1 I understood the whole imagery they were getting across when Thorin was on the ice rink of God but was that really the best idea they had fro him getting his head out of his ass ? I kept waiting for him to go through some solid character development but nope . He just reflects on some conversations he was n't present for then decides to care again .

1 Also , the fight scenes truly took advantage of Spidey 's web-slinging . That was easily my favorite part .

1 Very much so , Dachshund racing is a German tradition . I took my pup to one of the races and it was all beer , brats and lederhosen . Good times .

1 > he was in the original show , so it really makes sense , actually . Yes ... And ...

1 I love it . It 's completely Ron Burgundy .

1 I 've observed it in many films over many years ( and so will you if you look for it ) , that is n't really equivalent to making it up .

1 I just finished it . Bought it on a whim today without knowing anything about it , and wow it 's amazing .

1 D-Fens ! ! !

1 Not sure whose comments you think you read , but all week I pointed out what was the general consensus about TMNT and how well GotG was doing . If you want to cream your pants over the fact that I was only half right ( GotG did in fact slide just 56 % , pretty close to the 55 % that was predicted ) knock yourself out . My interest for last 6 months was never about how great I though GotG was going to be ( although any well done film is always welcomed ) - it was about how the potential was being overlooked , especially when everything else was factored in . The treat in your post is the assumptions you make about my love of GotG and hate of Bay , when there 's really no evidence either way if you truly did go through my post history .

1 The spider man universe is massive . They just keep retelling his origin .

1 That article was not written by someone who knows a lot about vfx .

1 `` I 'm sorry Dave , I 'm afraid I ca n't do that . '' HAL 's voice still creeps me out .

1 That is such a douchebag move , like subtly hinting at how he knows something that you do n't and trying to spoil it for you without actually doing it himself . I have friends like that to , it annoys me to no end .

1 The book is wonderful . Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted for many years but was an amazing and sensitive writer .

1 It 's not so much a strict policy as an allowance for us to be able to keep the new queue clean for people who spend a lot of time here . New or infrequent users probably wo n't notice any change . There are still enough unique questions that get asked that the ratio of discussion to links and news probably wo n't change , plus most of the rehashed posts never touched our front page anyways . They just get downvoted because they are asked every week and end up crowding the new queue . This is just us announcing that we 'll be picking up the clutter if need be .

1 Hopefully Jai Courtney redeems himself for being an uninteresting actor despite getting Hollywood roles

1 Yeah , that 's not what the article is saying .

1 I too thought `` she '' were a girl . Only that `` she '' was a tomboy and felt `` her '' self more like a boy than a girl and everyone would accept that ( and mistake `` her '' for a boy ) . You know , irony and stuff . ( Btw : the voice actor in the German dub was a girl , so a . ) the Dub-Studio could'nt tell either or b . ) they just did n't give a fuck )

1 Not me , I dropped out . The material was just too difficult to my head around .

1 So glad Liam did n't get the role . That would have been weird as shit .

1 Epic scene . Oldman has never been better .

1 People like you are why so much programming is garbage .

1 That 's a bit melodramatic , do n't you think ?

1 I support this plan . I support any plan that involves placing Emily Blunt in a situation where she is kicking ass .

1 This thread title hurts my head so I can not even think of a way to answer it .

1 You are 100 % correct on this . Cloudy 2 was just lacking .

1 Was that a quote from the movie I do n't remember or are you just an asshole ?

1 I 'll save lots of lube and towells for that day .

1 Just to add another , R. Lee Ermey started acing at 34 , though supposedly he had previously acted in several Filipino films before that .

1 > ... overbearing ... Hheheheheh

1 When first released , Alien was given an X rating in the UK . Nearly every single country on earth rated it 16-18 plus , with a few notable exceptions like Japan . The only reason Japan rated it at 12+ is because at the time anything that was rated higher was actually illegal for anyone under the age rating to see -- regardless of whether or not their parents approved , so if it had gotten a higher rating then nobody under that age could see it in the theater even if their parents accompanied them .

1 Personally , the Mandingo fight and D'artangan dog situation were very disturbing , and while some people did n't like them there , I liked how * dark * it was .

1 Dat slow zoom on Dirk 's face is legendary .

1 Pretty much . The fridge scene actually did n't bother me ( anyone who 's worried about the science in Indiana Jones ... * really ? * ) , but the aliens felt out of place with the three earlier movies .

1 Avatar is first , Frozen second .

1 Tom Hanks is a slightly distant cousin of Walt Disney ( and Abraham Lincoln ) The director of the 2002 version of The Time Machine was the great grandson of H.G Wells

1 A better one is when he starts beating himself up in his boss 's office and says to himself `` For some reason it reminded me of my fight with Tyler outside the bar '' . Edit : Aaaand I see that you mentioned this in a reply already .

1 > It 's an action movie that mixes in aspects of a political thriller . That 's exactly why it 's stupid to call it a political thriller . You answered your own question . When I think of political thriller I think of The Manchurian Candidate , Syriana , The Constant Gardener , things like that . Like you said , Cap 2 is an action movie that has a sprinkling of political thriller thrown in .

1 Do you mind rewriting that comment a bit ... better ?

1 He makes good movies but my Lord does he just absolutely suck as a person .

1 If you 've seen the documentary Overnight you can see why he became a one-hit wonder ( and that 's being kind , I will never understand the love for The Boondock Saints , its an awful Tarantino ripoff ) . Dude 's a supreme douchelord who dug his own grave and buried himself in it .

1 Fantastic film and really emotional review . It 's fitting that Ebert 's last filed review was for Malick 's next film , [ To the Wonder ] ( http : / www.rogerebert.com / reviews / to-the-wonder-2013 ) - also really worth reading .

1 I love that one . Met Luke Kirby and interviewed him . Such a sweet and genuine guy .

1 And then that perfectly timed cello chord immediately after

1 > You mean dough-girl Scarlet Johansson who only gets a few minutes of lines , and spends the rest of the time in blurry `` take-down '' scenes where you ca n't really see what is going on ? Black Widow got more screen time than anyone but Captain America and Iron Man , and more dialogue time than any other character ( [ apparently ] ( http : / geektyrant.com / news / 2012 / 5 / 10 / how-much-screen-time-did-each-of-the-avengers-get.html ) ) .

1 I think he comes off as a dick in his tweets because you cant hear him say those things in his own voice Whenever he interjects with a scientific correction in interviews and stuff , its always with a smile and a light hearted tone to it that makes it clear he 's just joking . Brief tweets dont really capture the real attitude behind his jokes .

1 Oh , good lord , The Witches freaked me the hell out the first time I saw it . Awesome movie .

1 The movie starts with Riley moving across the country when her dad accepts a new job in San Francisco according to an official synopsis . That , along with Puberty and having her childhood memories tainted ( possibly by finding out that the `` good '' memory had negative repercussions , or that it was n't as good as she remembers . ) are probably what causes the depression to sink in .

1 That 's how I found out there was no Santa Claus .

1 wow , maybe a spoiler tag for movies that are still in theatres ?

1 I agree ! It went by very quickly !

1 There was a screening of Invasion of the Body Snatchers that I went to at Hollywood Forever in Los Angeles . The film was amazing , but it got increasingly difficult to take it seriously . There were all of these things that I 'm sure were revolutionary at the time , but due to age or constant use , they just do n't hold up 30+ years later .

1 I really think the Blues Brothers is the best film of all time . And not just one , but two incredible car chases ? Yes , please . Oh , add John Candy to one of the car chases ? Yes , please .

1 Agreed . He 's been talking about this shit for * at least * 10years . I remember hearing him bring it up on Petros and Money in like '07 .

1 A giant floating head fighting a battle with a witch that had been imprisoned for 10,000 specifically asks for 5 teenagers with attitude to control giant robots in the shape of dinosaurs and then combine into one giant robot to destroy monsters grown by the witch throwing her staff from the moon to Earth . The show is a bit silly already .

1 lol , i have n't seen the movie but saw the trailer and his voice seemed ... well , whiny ...

1 I 've heard The Wolverine unrated extended cut is everything people want but I have n't seen for my self .

1 I dont know a single person who wouldnt watch that movie .

1 No dialogue whatsoever . Just furious masturbating while staring into the lens .

1 Is n't that the question of the day ?

1 And the Social Network is overrated how ?

1 She did respond to some online comments in her book . Maybe this is a ploy to be published !

1 Sure , time dialation happens in special relativity but the consequence that a space voyager would come back to find all his friends withered and old ca n't be due to relative constant velocity . Special relativity means that in inertial reference frames ( I 'm always at rest in mine ) , something I perceive to be traveling quickly through space will be traveling more slowly through time . If we just look at two inertial reference frames ( say , two twins ) , each perceives the other to be traveling very quickly and therefore `` aging '' more slowly . So , how can we know who is going to be older when they meet again ? That 's the essence of the twin paradox and it 's resolved by general relativity by noting that only one of the twins undergoes acceleration to come back . This kills the problematic symmetry .

1 Remember , Sully , when I promised to kill you last ? * I lied . *

1 I 'm going in , hold my wallet .

1 It did n't `` basically '' win every award it was nominated for , it won every award it was nominated for . 11 nominations , 11 wins . It is tied with Ben-Hur and Titanic for most wins for a single film . Also it and Titanic were the only films to ever win / be nominated for ( I ca n't remember the exact statistic ) every singly technical award . It had a pretty good run at the Oscars .

1 His intention was to do both but they recast without telling him , apparently .

1 You have to try REALLY hard to give that little of a shit .

1 But in that 5 seconds you can see the glare of the ape and the intelligence in that stare

1 Wolfpop is a new pop culture channel curated by Paul Scheer with development from Matt Gourley and Adam Sachs . Sister network to Earwolf .

1 irreversible is a touchy film for the exact reasons you mentioned . the reason I like it is because it 's just honest . it does n't hold anything back . and despite the violence there really is a love story in there and the ending ( for me ) felt ambiguous which I enjoyed . if you ever get the chance , the DVD had commentary and a making of and it 's mind blowing how they created those scenes and it 's interesting noes insight on the film .

1 Ah yes , Mr. Bean , one of the shining examples of great pantomime . Love that show .

1 Why even say that ? Why not let him find out on his own ?

1 The Dude does not abide .

1 To be fair , that girl he 's referring to probably * was * ugly as all fuck .

1 Pretty much no similarities at all

1 i cried man

1 Agreed , I was going to say the same . Basically the commentary for his movies are exactly why his Q & A 's and podcasts are so great .

1 Why ? Comic books go on indefinitely with new story arcs , why should n't comic book movies ?

1 Clearly not as many as did when Bruce Almighty came out .

1 Working in the sound industry I 'm very glad they are different categories . They are different arts which both take a unique set of skills .

1 I think the use of music during the final day as a gangster is the best I have ever seen . The scream from Magic Bus as he slams on the breaks in the car was wonderful .

1 I agree . They took NPH 's magic tricks , rolled it together with crediting Price-Waterhouse which they always do , and tried to have a full bit through the night . It just did n't float because it took waaaay to long to get to the payoff and they had to keep referencing it so people did n't forget .

1 I heard Hank Pym has nothing to do with it , but then again , rumors are Ultron came from a program Howard Stark designed , and with Hank Pym 's age in the film , he might had worked with Howard on it just to acknowledge fans that Hank had some part of it . Honestly , I 'd kind of feel a bit insulted if there is Ultron with JUST a cameo of Hank Pym because it just feels like Pym should always be there to fight Ultron one way or another as his creator or father . It might just be better to leave Hank out of it in general and pin everything on Tony for waking a program his dad created , but honestly , with how Hydra is involved , I predict , that it is Hydra having stolen some of Tony 's armor from Iron-Man 3 , trying to replicate the tech . Tony has the avengers invade the castle to get his tech back , but there is a altercation with Tony 's armor , the mind gem , and Scarlet Witch which causes JARVIS to develop a mind of his own , and thus Ultron is born . This is just my speculation , of course , but this implies Ultron was n't intentionally created , and the trailer really plays on the motif of `` there are no puppets on me . '' implying he might had been a tool in the first place . But overall , Scarlet Witch had to be involved , and I think there is a connection between Hydra and the mind gem as well as Stark 's tech . But you kind of see how Pym does n't fit in there .

1 Discussion , obviously .

1 You meant to say `` most accurate , '' right ?

1 I was really hoping it was some secret technology which had been stolen along with the names of the agents ... I really wanted Silva to have this super badass moment on the island just after the helicopters came in , and somehow disable all their engines so they all crashed . And that would be Skyfall , because the things in the sky ... fall .

1 I get the train of thought but he was based on Sting .

1 Sounds like Invaders From Mars ( 1986 ) .

1 Came here to say this . The premise is outstanding . The execution made it pedestrian . And it was so promising in the first act .

1 My favorite on the list .

1 Your boner knew why .

1 I 'm not going to downvote you , but I predict that those who do so do it not because of a fear of besmirching Scorcese , but rather because you 're A ) being kind of abrasive , and B ) preemptively complaining about downvotes .

1 Yes .

1 That movie was such a fictionalized account , not just in terms of dramatization but actually changing the basics of the story and the reality of the town , that one of the former players has made it their `` hobby '' to end the canonization of Coach Boone , who they say was not any kind of hero or champion of racial equality . http : / deadspin.com / remember-the-titans-is-a-lie-and-this-man-wants-you-to-1609473834

1 I watched Infernal Affairs so many time and I love it so much . I was also excited about it being remade by Hollywood . So , I went to watch it in a cinema and it was the only time I wanted to leave the cinema halfway through a movie . I understand how people would love it if they have never seen the original because it is a great concept . But , if they have seen Infernal Affairs before , I am sure they would be disappointed of the remake .

1 [ Not everyone , but a few . ] ( http : / imgur.com / F7wIu )

1 I love that movie and that is my favorite line from it . I love Gutter .

1 Are you really trying to tell me what a movie you have never seen is about ? Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , while a fantastic movie ( quite possibly even better than Kane ) is not in the same category . I do n't necessarily enjoy watching the movie-the story is not entirely captivating , especially given the fact that the ending has been spoiled for all of us , but I never leave a screening of it without learning something . If you appreciate filmmaking , then there is something about the film that you will like , regardless of its plot .

1 Looks like it will be opening in China next week and Japan on August 9th . http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1663662 / releaseinfo

1 Many people seem to feel this way , but I disagree . Keaton is great , no doubt about it , and Chaplin can veer into the maudlin or the over-the-top goofy , but Chaplin has a * lot * going on even in his early shorts . I find that often when Keaton is n't playing specifically for laughs or thrills , that his stories get rather dull , whereas Chaplin captivates throughout . Check out Chaplin 's Mutual shorts like The Floorwalker , The Cure , The Pawnshop . Of course The Gold Rush ( silent version , please ! ) and City Lights are great too

1 Watched it last night . amazing . Glad we get one more . And I want to read the book now .

1 But the actual ending is n't a happy ending at all ... Think about this : If the movie had ended where you wanted it to , then everything that had happened would just have been simulation . But with the alternate universes being created every single time they restart the source code it creates a much more intriguing and dark story . Think about all the different parallel universes created where the girl dies , where Jake / Sean dies , where everybody on the train dies ( and later much of Chicago presumably ) . And what would the aftermath of be of a nuke going off in a major metropolitan area ? Not to mention , how does Vera Farmiga 's character handle knowing that it 's not just a simulation ? And then there 's the the obvious problem that everybody picked up on , does Jake just steal Sean Fentress ' life and girlfriend ? If the movie had ended at the pitch perfect freeze-frame of them kissing then it would have had the perfect happy ending . Jake would have caught the guy before the nuke went off , Vera Farmiga 's character would have been happy having saved Jake from a lifetime of AI-servitude , and Jake himself would have gone out in the perfect moment kissing the girl . It seems a lot of this went over the heads of people when they initially watched it . I recommend that everybody who hated the 'happy ' ending re-watch it with these things in mind , and see if they do n't appreciate it more .

1 I 'm confused about why buddy is getting downvoted .

1 It is n't a reference , it 's a German doing what Germans do . it 's like saying that the Australian guys calling each other `` mate '' is a reference to that one other movie where the Australian guys call each other `` mate ''

1 I 'm actually the opposite . I saw the first movie and immediately bought all 3 books . I sat down and read them cover to cover and I really appreciated Katniss 's point of view . The first movie really did n't do justice to how she interpreted everything and it just seemed too straight to the point . Also , without it being first person , the focus bounces around to different people and some surprises just get thrown out .

1 Be strong , brother .

1 Yeah , Silverman is pretty cool over all , especially with the hilarious chemistry her and Mark displayed in the OP . I was put off by how filthy gross some of her shit is , but now It 's what I love about her . As far as female comics go , most of them suck - it degrades into this outdated `` he 's not passing attention to my needs '' drivel , which may be reality / truth , but just is n't comedy .

1 Hey , I liked it -- it 's shitty , but shit is what you get out of such a lifestyle .

1 I do n't feel like one scene can ever really cheapen an entire movie , but then I saw The Guest and the last like 10 minutes were that for me . So I do n't know what to believe . For me , the last scene was bad but not something that brought the movie down .

1 I forgot it before , and I 'll forget it again ! You ca n't stop me !

1 It 's an anachronism .

1 I 'd say The World 's End fits this better . Hot Fuzz is pretty dark from the start , TWE seems like a reunion movie for the first 30 minutes . That 's just my opinion though , I 'm one of the few people who ranks TWE above Hot Fuzz .

1 And the characters explicitly say it ( `` We are the walking dead '' ) in both the show and the comics .

1 Man that makes me feel old . I watched it in the theater LOL

1 That is n't Robin .

1 Well , yes and no . * Some * of these make use of the digital stitching together of multiple long takes into one really long take , most notably the car ambush scene and the final battle sequence . However , the majority of these are your standard , normal long takes . Also , of the ones that use digital stitching & compositing are still either a collection of impressive long takes on their own , or are a single long take that was shot multiple times and the best of each instance was used .

1 I liked it .

1 Go see it in IMAX . The CGI is amazing and watching it in IMAX allows you to really see all of the work that went into making the movie . But be warned the writing seems to have been done by an elementary child .

1 Netflix has tons of categories that can get way more specific than that , such as `` Animated dysfunctional-family TV comedies '' or `` Violent Vacation Horror Movies '' . Just because the category exists is in no way indicative of a `` Hollywood agenda '' .

Meaning that the matches everyone is really paying to see wo n't occur until later when all spectators are present . Kind of how like no one would be upset to missing the opening band if they paid to see a band 's concert .

1 Have n't seen it yet , but ' ... wan na fight ? ' , so awesome !

1 The first role of his I 'd seen and my favorite . Strong is such a badass

1 Can I trade mine in ? It 's lightly used .

1 And it 's on Netflix

1 It 's everywhere , motherfucker . Site-wide at this point .

1 Kevin Spacey has had equal watershed moments for me .

1 Grave Encounters really is quite superb . It was handled well all the way through .

1 I 'm pretty sure he had input on the beginning stages of the script . Not saying he wrote it , Goyer deserves most of the credit , but Nolan did help craft the story .

1 That was never , ever , going to happen .

1 I did n't get that `` TV set '' feel at all . But , some people experience things differently . I had read a few reviews that talked about it before I saw the movie and was expecting it , but I never noticed it . I mentioned higher up on the thread that it did remind me , especially the fight scenes , of watching sports , just for the speed with which everything moved and the simultaneous action . You get drawn less to one individual and more to the whole scene . Which , when it 's a movie about 13 dwarves and a hobbit and a wizard , probably helps .

1 I disagree . I thought she was good in : Bend It Like Beckham Atonement Domino Anna Karenina Never Let Me Go ( such a good adaptation of an amazing book ) A Dangerous Method half of those films are period films and she only wears a corset in two of them .

1 Not sure why you 're getting downvoted ... What you 're saying is completely relevant to the thread and you 're just expressing your opinion like everyone else ... * The Reddit Self Correcting Mechanism seems to be in good working order again .

1 The producer receives the Oscar for Best Picture . There was never a Best Producer award .

1 Just watched The World 's End the other day , loved it ... but did anyone else feel like the movie was a sci-fi version of `` The Warriors '' ? The Bathroom fight scene was pretty similar .

1 The descent .

1 The Robert Redford version had no heart IMO , it 's faithful to the story but does n't show the themes of the story at all . While I felt Luhrmann 's Gatsby was also a miss it did a better job at engrossing me in the world .

1 Did you even read OP ?

1 This . She seems pretty damn excited to see the movie , not pissed in the slightest .

1 Apparently ...

1 You 're very naive .

1 sorry , but you are sounding like a smart ass .

1 I feel like you are right . They could have easily shown deleted scenes from the first too just to mislead people . So many wasted opportunities . Then again , it sold like crazy so the business people do n't think so . To them , it went very well .

1 I liked it . It was n't a perfect film , and I was n't fond of the opening sequence on Krypton ( which managed to be overly long yet far too compressed ) , but it was enjoyable and presented an interesting take on Superman . A lot of the issues that people seem to have with the film seem to be that it is n't the original Superman film , and it 's not the same take on the character , with a lot of people complaining that an inexperienced Superman accidentally destroys part of the city - something that happens constantly in the comics and other spin offs .

1 Considering District 9 did n't follow the typical Hollywood storyline , I think it 's fair we give Neill Blomkamp the benefit of the doubt until shown otherwise .

1 I 'm not assuming all CGI , nor did I say it is not 0 % more work , I 'm saying that it 's not double the work overall .

1 You know that john carpenter 's movie was n't the original . The original was from 1951ish and , while hokey nowadays , was pretty good for its time .

1 It was only nominated for two , Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song . It lost to * Finding Nemo * and * The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King * , respectively .

1 I 'm guessing they wanted to show how the actual filming and script has progressed and decided to make something radically different from the old trailers . The first one was basically a full CGI tech demo and the even second did n't show any actors ' faces .

1 Tom Cruise may be a little crazy but he is a damn good actor .

1 Seriously . Let them make their own movie with Ghostbusters nowhere in the title . It 's like Hollywood has not one original idea left in it 's coked out fucking brain .

1 Hes an alright guy , but he entirely succumbs to greed . That doesnt make him a good guy . Sure he has some sort of redemption , but only by selling out his friends and ripping people off with those sad inspirational speeches . I dont think hes sympathetic .

1 Good film . Elizabeth Pena RIP . Chris Cooper was great as always and so was Kris Kristoffersen . I really like small town crime movies .

1 There are rights issues for all movies they release .

1 I knew you could hear the waitress say `` Garcon means boy '' in the late diner scene , but I never knew you could hear Vince and Jules in the opening scene . Thanks !

1 Not as big as the Bagger .

1 Not surprising , most young adults would rather see a horror movie than a drama . That being said , I ca n't wait to see Gone Girl later tonight .

1 Probably because he does n't .

1 I thought they did a great job ; especially considering the technical demands of the film .

1 If you 're gon na troll on Reddit , you got ta be more believable than that : - )

1 You might like : Lawrence of Arabia Ch ? Dr. Zhivago Goodfellas

1 I liked that origin . It was pretty effective ( in fact , I hope they follow most of Spectacular 's storylines as a guideline . ) They 're also making him power hungry , wanting to be unique and special and then he gets his powers .

1 If they wait much longer , Michael Cera is going to enter puberty !

1 That 's ridiculous . If you want to do 'whatever ' then do THAT at home . The theater is a place people go to watch and listen to a movie , anything that is damaging to those ends - loud noises , distracting lights or actions - should be removed from the environment .

1 Yeah that 's the whole point , fuck humans

1 I have a theory about how that 's going to play out . I think Ultron 's going to be already built , or just finished , by the time the movie starts . He goes with the team on their first mission in the movie and notices little things here and there that makes him seriously start to hate humanity . And he also gets seriously fucked up . The team returns to their tower victorious and throw a big old party . Ultron the interrupts them with a classic `` Are you people fucking serious ? '' speech and goes rogue , setting up the conflict to wrangle the robotic sucker back in line . Or blow him up with lightning . They 'll probably utilize Quicksilver And Scarlet Witch who they captured during the first part and they 'll struggle with loyalty stuff until the climactic , emotional finale . * EDIT : * Alternatively , the party scene takes place at the very end and Ultron comes back for a final `` Better luck next time , fuckers ! '' and leaves them to choke on it .

1 For theatrical cinema , 48fps is indeed amazing new technology . Especially when coupled with 3D and digitally filmed . It 's not that it is rarely used . It is never used . The desire for more clarity and better definition led Jackson to use 48fps . It was not because anyone who knows anything thought it would look better . In fact , they almost assuredly knew that it would look worse and be unsettling . Real things look more real in 48fps as if they were filmed on home movie camera 's . Meanwhile , fake things ( props , sets , makeup ) looks much more fake in 48fps . In Lord of the Rings the sets and props and makeup looked great . In The Hobbit they looked cheap . And do n't boast that the film is `` Superb Cinema , '' it was a cool kids movie with no character progression , forced protagonist vs . protagonist conflict , elongated scenes with too much fat , and an anticlimactic final battle sequence . It was ... ok .

1 I guess you could say.. it lost that loving feeling !

1 I tried Googling it . Still do n't get it .

1 British . Brilliant humour , self-deprecation but mostly for their avoidance of cliches .

1 I loved the song 'Burger King Batman ' .

1 It does not translate to the movie universe .

1 That 's usually the M.O . for true nymphos . I dated one , once , and when I found out the degree to which she was sabotaging the lives of not only the men she was constantly pursuing and sleeping with , but her complete lack of remorse towards all the broken homes she created or even an acknowledgement of the harm she was doing to her own life , it dawned on me that nymphomania must be a shade of sociopathy . Watching the Nymphomaniac films was especially hard , considering my experience with it , but it also shed a lot of light on what I had never understood about it . Allowed me to come to terms with mistakes I thought I had made , until it turned out I was a sort of victim in a woman 's sexual rampage . Great movies though . I 'm a big fan of Lars Von Trier .

1 When I was younger , I was really into his movies . Nowadays , I buy them almost exclusively for the commentaries . They feel like his Evening With Kevin Smith films .

1 Because you were home

1 They have wigs ?

1 WOW as in World of Warcraft ? holy shit

1 Tears from your whispering eye do n't count

1 Fuck yeah . And the `` We 're going old school '' with Brian driving underneath the semi .

1 WHAT DID HE * JUST * SAY

1 You are n't , that was my first thought too .

1 Imagine the postage on that letter

1 I think at that point he felt he had trained Django enough to be able to handle the situation , and it was the ultimate gesture in a way . It said `` I abhor slavery so much , that I simply ca n't tolerate this man being alive any longer '' . Which shows a lot to Django .

1 Movie marketing like this kicks ass . I do n't think I 've seen anything on the scale of the Dark Knight campaign back in '07 / '08 , but seriously impressed when studios bring movies to life like this . Anyone got any other good examples of quality movie marketing like this ?

1 I imagine it being like the last of us

1 No , you do it * now . *

1 Yep.. If i see 'remake ' ever again , fuck Hollywood .

1 SCHMIDT FUCKED THE CAPTAIN 'S DAAAAAAAAAUGHTER ! SCHMIDT FUCKED THE CAPTAIN 'S DAAAAAAAAAUGHTER !

1 ... the Aristocrats ! ! !

1 Disney does n't do direct to DVD sequels anymore that was Michael Eisner 's thing . I heard that Disney 's reliance on those things was one of the reasons why he was ousted .

1 Excellent movies , but KKBB definetly has more comedy ( or just funny lines ) . I mean there are a few jokes in the movies too , but KKBB just has one epic quote after the next .

1 Perfect .

1 Most definitely Pixar films rank at the top of animation in terms of cinematography .

1 Just watching this for the nth time , it 's one of my all time favourite movies . Realised that , given it 's age , there 's probably a number of people out there in this reddit that has n't seen it . If you 're in that boat , the best comparison I could give would be to another of my favourite movies , the Blues Brothers . Great soundtrack held together by a number of good talking set pieces and action sequences . Fun ride . Not very historically accurate and it 's got a couple of flaws , but even still it 's one of my all time favourite movies . [ Trailer link . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Goj3RGld4mI ) And the soundtrack is just incredible .

1 Laughing is fine , it 's an involuntary action but clapping ? Really ? ! Who are you clapping to ? It 's a sign of appreciation and congratulation , who are you congratulating ?

1 It lost me when she shot Bond and then would n't take a second shot when the target is exposed on top of the train . And let 's not forget the stealthy escape across a pitch black moor with a torch !

1 The LOTR is a great series , not much comes close to it in the fantasy genre . However , to disregard the Hobbit as being 'not as good ' as LOTR is pretty ignorant . Both books have different audiences , and as a children 's book the Hobbit is down right amazing . As an Adult , I still read that book every few years and it checks in as one of my favorite books of all time . While the tone may be different , I 'm fairly certain that Jackson can create a film that matches or excels the LOTR films .

1 More like the old ones ? 1 and 2 are nothing alike .

1 Public Enemies ? Really ?

1 WORST CASE ONTARIO

1 But ... what you forget ... is that it is n't Superman yet . He 's brand new to the saving game . These are the rookie misstakes of a fledgling superhero . And if the writers are any good , they will adress this in the coming movies .

1 Do n't watch the trailer first . It does n't quite spoil it , but it pretty much spoils it . You 'll enjoy it more if you go in blind .

1 Maybe when you 're older .

1 Aswell ? Astrid Lindgren , the author of Pippi , Ronia the Robbers Daughter and a whole generation of stories , is Swedish . She 's one of Sweden 's most acclaimed authors . A national treasure , if we ever had one .

1 Dude 's got a mortgage . Several of them .

1 Well ... I 'm glad that has cleared everything up .

1 O ' Brother Where Art Thou ?

1 DJANGOOOOOO ! !

1 Yea ... . but good luck finding any critic nowadays who would give it a negative review .

1 Lol really ? I would also have expected them to make their own font to . I mean why not spend another couple thousand to make a custom professional font while your already spending a bajillion dollars .

1 Because hype , marketing , presentation have everything to do with how successful a movie does at the box office ( especially since the window is only smaller ) . This is the same reason why movie sets are so secretive about their scripts etc . Denby knew exactly what he meant by that statement .

1 Please try being less stupid next time .

1 The Shining . The Kubrick one , of course .

1 Subversion on a massive level ! One of the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood !

1 Seems like he 's a good fit . He managed to captured the more complex and emotional sides of the character even if he did n't have a lot of plot to work with in Avengers . Without all that Hulk is just green mayhem . Sorta like jolly green giant + collateral damage .

1 Sepetah !

1 Optimus Prime executes Sentinel Prime , whom is played by Nimoy . Not particularly sure why it 's more tasteless now .

1 That was a phenomenal speech to listen to . Very well done by Lupita .

1 Thanks for the link , there 's a bunch of interesting research in there .

1 Top 3 all time , right after Kazaam and Steel . Shaq should have won an Oscar for both roles .

1 I came here to say this . Everytime I watch it I get man tears filling up my eyes . Awesome scene in an awesome film

1 Saw that a few weeks back for the first time - could n't believe it !

1 The scene where the tub falls through the floor and Tom Hanks goes off the deep end with his laugh , still brings tears to my eyes .

1 * Alien * * Scream * * Texas Chainsaw Massacre * ( First Remake )

1 For anyone with even remotely religious leanings it is one of those holy shit movies though .

1 Daniel Tosh ! Never have I been so insulted on Reddit .

1 I 've been doing it since about '85 . Does that make me the winner or loser ? EDIT : Just double checked . First two stubs : `` The Man With One Red Shoe '' and `` Ferris Bueller 's Day Off ''

1 Fair enough , im on an iPhone : )

1 That is your definition of a fact ? Everything you said is completely subjective .

1 Everything about the guy is lowest-common-denominator . This movie sounds par for the course compared to `` Pretend Time '' .

1 You hate that job anyway ; I do n't see why you do n't just quit . Because I want to fit in . American Psycho

1 No but they could actually bounce a ball of him .

1 Some of them have been made into radio plays . I think some of his later books are just too full of in-jokes to make a successful transition , but I 'd definitely go with one of the Brentford Trilogy books . Actually , I 'd rather like to see the Armageddon series as a film . I just love the thought of a Time travelling sprout possessed Elvis .

1 Do n't let it all get ya down man . It 's just Reddit . If you get misunderstood , it 's probably a better use of your time to just move on and ignore it rather than argue about it .

1 Yes . ? Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris are what made the movie unrealistic ...

1 Funny , when I wrote that last time about this movie , I got downvoted . But Mawkish got me upvotes . Live and learn .

1 The problem is that Nicole Kidman is not talking . She just walked away and refuses to address any of those Scientology issues . It would be brilliant if she were to speak up . By the way- there were tons of rumors that she only married Tom because they had a 10 year marriage contract . Kind of like the same rumour we currently hear about Katie and 5 year contract .

1 Star Wars ... `` * A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far Far Away * `` No but in all seriousness it has to go to Schindler 's List . That movie is a masterpiece on every level

1 i just wet myself

1 Hopefully it comes to xbox soon .

1 It is also the same / similar substance that created us , so it is possible ( believing that nothing had happened to the Engineers ) that they would have shown and taught the Prometheus crew what it was and why they used it . However as we saw with the aggression from the awoken Engineer in cryo-sleep we could assume that this 'invitation ' was in fact a trap to see whether their creation could ever become a potential threat . Or they were n't satisfied with what humanity had become .

1 I think people should bring all kinds of reddit meme signs to the Colbert / Stewart thing ...

1 I love this movie so much

1 Game of Death . Or every video game ever .

1 In Rear Window too . That woman oozes class .

1 It does n't have a standard plot structure , but it 's far from confusing and incoherent . Pierrot Le Fou is an incoherent movie , The Master makes plenty of sense . > It 's about a fictional cult like religion This is n't true it 's about the evolution of the characters , it does n't make an ounce of difference if the cult was inspired by Scientology or not > People who say they like / understand this movie are liars The plebbiest of pleb statements

1 Thank you ! I did have a minor role doing character design / concept art / matte painting in Aleksandr Sokurov 's [ Faust ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1437357 / ) ( 2011 ) . You can see some of my paint work in the opening shot . There is another more recent film I do n't think I can talk about yet . To see a lot of matte paintings by me , check out another xmas film [ The Flight Before Christmas ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0885415 / ) ( 2008 ) where I painted most of the backgrounds throughout the whole film .

1 > ... a never ending sea of retardation ... Welcome to the internet .

1 I think that Uwe Boll creates the type of movies that you are looking for , high budget movies with great actors that wind up being terrible . I 've watched two of his movies and both were really bad .

1 I agree . I actually hate Superman , I think he is an unrelatable dick , but that trailer is awesome and I 'm definitely going to go see the movie .

1 The comment system is not static . If it is sorted under best , you 'll get different results .

1 He was a romantic who believed in love and was enamored by everything she was . Except he did n't see her for what she was . He was never the type of man who would be okay with the type of relationship that she was willing to have with him . She did n't do anything wrong but she was very much the wrong person for him , just as much as he was the wrong person for her . So she was n't a bad person but it probably gets annoying for some people to watch the guy keep justifying what she does just to keep her being perfect for him . And we see it from his point of view so to some it might also feel like she misled him . She did n't but the movie did a good job of raising the viewer 's expectations along with his that this was going to end the way every rom-com traditionally does .

1 But which one of you misspelled retarded ?

1 I think it really shows the type of ego that someone doing Vincent 's job would have .

1 The warboys looked just like the Ghost Clan , the vehicles from Rage are super inspired by Road Warrior or Beyond the Thunderdome . I got home and loaded Rage up and tore ass around the landscape , blowing up buggies with the wonderful sound of the v8 in my cupertino . Even the beginning of the movie and the loading screen of the game have the same engine growl noise .

1 As a family , we love it . The whole `` with me / without me '' thing , is part of family life .

1 ERIC : `` Boyhood '' all the way . I 've seen it several times , most recently yesterday , and noticed more small details . It 's the rare cinematic gift that keeps on giving . No other 2014 release blew me away on that scale .

1 Sure , but it still provides meaningful information . Criterion films are also rated very high on IMDb , while hacky parodies like Disaster Movie are rated very low . It 's been a useful metric to me at least . Do you have some examples of inaccurate ratings ?

1 Old Boy .

1 I did n't get that vibe at all . Halle Barry 's character was reluctant to use her medical technology on the child but realized how absurd her non-interventionist position was . And then there are the space colonies that kept the human race going after earth had become somehow inhabitable . So I do n't see the film treating technology as inherently bad , it 's more about the intentions of the user .

1 Are n't those normally ... filled with water ?

1 Yeah , I ca n't count how many times I went home with some awesome movie I probably would never have watched if it had n't been recommended by a Blockbuster employee . I 'll use streaming when I 'm sure of what I want to watch , otherwise I go up the road to Blockbuster .

1 Well I 'm willing to bet that you disagreed with at least one of these critics in the article . Was that critics opinion `` logically sound '' to you ? Opinions are just opinions , and critics are only worth anything because of their followers . The most popular critics are those that have the same taste in culture as their audience , and are able to communicate in a way that their audience understands . In the end , in the same way theres no food that everyone will enjoy , there is no `` right way '' to make a movie .

Then mysteriously and totally random in every way Dredd turns out to have a very similar plot . No way did he read the script for Dredd that was released online before The Raid went into production , he is welsh , they are very trust worthy .

1 I remember seeing this shortly after it came out . It certainly ca n't be considered a 'good ' movie , but there are a few moments that are comedy classics . Bill Maher and Shannon Tweed both have decent delivery ; Adrien Barbeau phones it in ( as-per-usual ) . The funny part is that this was my first exposure to Bill Maher . Even to this day , even after Bill Maher saturation in some areas , I still see him and say , `` Hey ! That 's the guy from the Amazon movie ! '' I 'm sure that Mr. Maher would appreciate that .

1 Ah thats a classic one . Pier Paolo Pasolini is truly a great filmmaker I completely agree .

1 Eh the age gap is not that big between the chars . JGL does look part for McGinnis though .

1 Yup . I had much more fun at transformers 3 than I had at pacific Rim even after the insufferable hype . The intro to dark of the moon with the moon landing was very very good . I will watch this movie about a robo-Jesus riding a robo T-rex while wielding a sword and I will squeal like a pig stuck on stupid .

1 Movie spoofs , only got better , in becoming their own genre , two of the best in recent memory are edgar wrights shawn of the dead and hot fuzz . Being a spoof does not mean sacrificing plot and story for cheap laughs , but means being a legitimate movie that pokes fun at a genre .

1 Most useless spoiler tag ever . I ca n't know whether I 'll be spoiled with a movie I 've never seen until I click on it and get `` spoiled . '' Should go without saying that threads like this can not be spoiler-free , by their nature .

1 Came here for Bill and Ted , was not disappointed .

1 That 's how I feel after really long , pointless opening credits . But sometimes a title card can just punch you in the face for how awesome it is , like in the lion king .

1 Drive and Only God Forgives are completely different films . They just have the same lead actor and similar art styles . That 's like saying Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown are the same films . Drive is a great movie , but its is n't a movie that appeals to the standard movie goer , which is why it generally is n't received well . And I really doubt it will go away . Its been 3 years since it came out and people still talk about it all the time . In fact , Rob Ager the blogger film critic ( who despised it ) said it would be forgotten in a few months , and he was completely wrong . People mistake it being terrible for not appealing to them . I do n't particularly like The Shawshank Redemption , but I recognize it 's value and achievement , so I do n't say its terrible . I know plenty of film fans who love Drive just as much as I do , and that 's because its a great movie that says a lot without saying much .

1 The one thing I never hear people compliment that movie for is the cinematography . They did such a good job of making me feel like I was watching a comic book .

1 You can still appreciate it , but it is best if you have seen them all both X1-3 and First class , cause it combines both of those worlds .

1 Sort of ? The Guardians are kind of like a street-level team that just happens to deal with cosmic-level problems . They 're definitely not The Galaxy 's Mightiest Heroes , they 're just a bunch of dudes who are in way over their heads because nobody else will step up to deal with these problems . The Annihilators were the proper Space Avengers , in the Galaxy 's Mightiest Heroes sense . They were all characters who normally dealt with universe-threatening events , coming together to deal with a threat that none of them individually could handle .

1 they 're the MCU versions .

1 It had a very unusual constraint that limited all the potential flow of the movie , but that made it entertaining to watch for me . It 's a lot different from other mainstream films , so I think it 's worth watching once . I also liked the fatherhood aspects of it .

1 Man , I keep getting downvoted here but yes , I wrote a review for RT and IMDB . I used my own name and indicated I made the movie . There were other reviews that were done by friends of the production but I do n't know which ones they are . I did n't write any for Netflix .

1 Well i hadnt seen that trailer before , and that made me want to watch it !

1 * Facepalm * Training Day my friend .

1 I just watched it as well ( with the Q & A too ) , and personally it resonated with me seemingly more then the other people in the cinema . I loved it . Gosling showed a unique perspective as he traversed the line of dreams and reality . The scene moves artistically from realism and spontaneity ( achieved through the great actors and the freedom allowed on set . i.e involving real Detroit residences ) to floaty fantasy dream-like sequences filled with great composition and a beautiful use of colour and light . It 's clear that he had certain visual moments he wanted to achieve and I think these mostly occur successfully . I went into the film expecting to appreciate the visual , and like the film artistically but not as a film , or a structure . However , I think that the essence of the film ; a small family story of decayed lives , really helped bring it forward as a whole piece . Obviously Matt Smith is strikingly good , but so is everyone else . The limited cast and short time span of the film emphasised both sides ; the realism of the environment , and the nightmarish tone . You expect to wake up , or be pulled out by some sudden change in events , but no . I think that it is a testament to Gosling 's creative ability that he unites the 'film ' aspects with the 'artistic ' aspects so well on his first film . Personally , I really like the lingers , the silences , the scenes that seem like short art pieces rather then sections of a film because it shows bravery and individuality to explore cinema as an art form . Sadly most people will judge it from a 'film ' point of view , and critique the structure and story and flow of it . Or because it just is n't of their taste , and that 's fine . But I really enjoyed it , and ca n't wait to see it again . Finally , I think that partly why I like it so much is that it is , above all , a story of people trying to find reason and purpose to their lives . Why is this happening ? Why am I doing this ? You can tell from Billy 's point of view that she wants to stay because to leave would be to accept that their home and their lives there were useless , empty and worth abandoning . As a 19 year old writing a bunch of crap online at half 1 , i like this film . It also looks nice .

1 I 've seen that movie 3 times . Each time is just as funny as the last . Wee oh wee oh WEEE OH WEEEEE ! !

THE PRETENSION CAN NOT GO GENTLY INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT ZIMMERHORNS !

1 the problem I had with the mask in the movie was that Willem Defoe basically could n't act through it . The only thing he could do was waggle his head like a power ranger . They did that thing where the eyes kept opening up , but that did n't help much and , in the context of the story , why did he keep doing that ?

1 Mel just told the story on PBS : American Masters about all of the 'Happy accidents ' that took place in order for Blazing Saddles to happen . * Mel prefers to do his own script and not one by someone else . * Richard Pryor ( Mel 's first choice for Bart ) fell through and Cleavon came on as a recommendation from Pryor . * The first Waco Kid - Gig Young turned out to be a hopeless drunk on set and had to be immediately replaced with Gene Wilder . In addition to all that , the most common quote I 've heard about Blazing Saddles is that 'no studio would green light it today ' due to the current trends of political correctness .

1 This was used on Rush 's most recent tour . It 's really for Rush fans more than fans of the movie .

1 I liked it , but it was pretty heavy handed at times . Especially the use of music , I did n't like the way the score was used to really milk the emotional moments as opposed to just letting them stand . I do think the performances were all fantastic , though . Watts was actually my least favorite of the three , but I still like that at least someone got some recognition . Holland destroyed everyone , though , fantastic performance from him . I do n't think it 's a great movie , but it does deserve to be seen . The racism claim and the complaint about how it 's telling how this tragedy ruined some rich white family 's vacation is just stupid , too . It 's one of those things that becomes popular to say even if you have n't seen the movie .

It 's well acted , well paced , well written , and manages to make a ridiculous over-the-top hero whose face consists of a visor and a jaw for the entire movie into someone interesting .

1 Planes was made by DisneyToon studios which is separate from W Disney Animation Studios . They make a lot of stuff for TV and straight to DVD , which was the original plan for Planes .

1 I hated Sucker Punch . Objectively , the plot was all over the place , there was no tone at all , and there was some rather questionable dialogue and acting . But apart from that , it was little more than a compilation of music videos conceived as juvenile wish fulfilment with a cack handed attempt to plaster over this with a half hearted bullshit `` girl power ! '' paint job . It remains one of the worst goddamned movies I have ever watched .

1 Well that explains Spirited Away , which was n't even available yet in the US when the Oscars happened that year . I remember before the Oscars having to pirate a Chinese-subtitled , Japanese-language version to show in my honors dorm , with me ( Japanese-fluent ) and a Chinese-literate friend taking turns translating for everyone else .

1 I agree . It 's actually a really well directed movie IMO . Prequels are always going to be tough to make , but I would n't even think to call it a `` bad movie . '' It was n't at all a waste of 2 hours . Ratner did a great job of recreating the universe of Silence of the Lambs without trying to rip off Demme . Also getting Danny Elfman to do the score was a great choice , it was very much like a Herrmann score for a Hitchcock film .

1 There 's nothing crazy new in this one . Mostly new shots of the robot , TARS , walking .

1 everyone 's mad cause she got the role from her father , that 's all : D

1 On the way home , I hit 90 on the on-ramp to the highway . I was fucking pumped . Later , I realized that was unreasonable and kept my speed at 80 .

1 `` Hey look , mister - we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast , and we do n't need any characters around to give the joint `` atmosphere '' . Is that clear , or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer ? ''

1 you 're right , it 's just a stupid thing I wrote , but ... do something like what ? this took like , what , 2 minutes to write ? You take a shit in more time than that and it took you 10 seconds to read it . Sorry if I inconvenienced you for that long .

1 ... He was talking about Leo . I think we can all fill in the blank when he says Django . No one was thinking , `` Django ... Leo was in the 1960s western ? '' Cool your jets on trying so hard to start a fight on the internet .

1 I do n't know . Loved both but the movie left out several things about the book that I liked . The T-Rex waterfall scene , the stuff with chaos theory , the darker ending .

1 When we went to see it , we had no idea it was a musical . One word ? Agony !

1 > Ghost in The Shell Follow that by for example Jin-Roh : The Wolf Brigade and Ghost in the Shell : Innocence .

1 It 's a great fucking movie .

1 The complaints are n't about the movie not being exactly like the book . The complaints are about the movie having * nothing * to do with the book . It 's like if * The Amazing Spider-man * had been entirely about Aunt May coping with living as a widow and her nephew 's sudden erratic behavior .

1 I agree to a point , but Goldblum had more experience in dramatic roles before he played as Ian Malcolm which made his character feel equal parts sarcastic and serious . I 'll wait until the movie to fully judge .

1 this guy

1 I would pay blood for this .

1 they did ! thats a great example ! i didnt watch Sopranos but whenever my friends talk about the ending i always think about this .

1 I use that all the time . Source : Otter lawyer

1 what an awesome movie .

1 Wot . The Abyss is his best film you lunatic !

1 I live pretty close to one . It 's nice , but I 'm getting annoyed how you ca n't see an IMAX movie without 3D . I really want to see * Godzilla * in IMAX , but I have no interest in 3D .

1 This is cool - thanks .

1 Alternatively , Disney is n't the tits

1 Watch Penny Dreadful . TV series which share quite a few similarities with that movie and comics .

1 Moviebob was defending against the sexism charge which the completionist just sort of glosses over . While the [ bag of spilling ] ( http : / tvtropes.org / pmwiki / pmwiki.php / Main / BagOfSpilling ) is common to a lot of metroid games , it 's notably averted in some cases ( some new suit mechanics are preserved from one to the next ) or usually in such a way where the player understands that they can not use something . The missing upgrade is not ( in the game ) physically still part of samus 's suit . Other M 's method of the bag of spilling only really just weakens Samus 's character overall .

1 Undoubtedly , but everyone making it knows exactly what it would be , and it was a hell of a lot of fun to work on .

1 No , Craig Robinson .

1 Yep . It 's hilarious how easily entertained people are .

1 He 's going about it the wrong way

1 Just like they 'll get out of the way of an ATAT !

1 Great that a character with such a distinctive voice has no dialogue for the first 10 minutes .

1 That 's cool , I do n't begrudge anyone who thinks differently about it . If the movie were truly a direct translation from the novel , I 'm sure I 'd still love it just as much .

1 Ah . [ Well , that 's that , then . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / HdaZkoa.gif )

1 If Pixar wants to make movies like UP , they need to make bank with Cars 2 .

1 He will be on the Comedy Bang Bang TV show eventually as a guest which should be interesting .

1 It 's those rolling punches when the guy is already downed , truly brutal .

1 Yes . Cumberbatch was originally meant to play the part that Tom currently has , but he ended up dropping out . I do n't know if he cited a reason or not , but it was a little sudden .

1 While that did give me a boner , I would n't say it 's the weirdest thing I 've ever seen .

1 The only good things about this movie were the Poison Ivy scenes .

1 He was cast first . Hollywood discussions mostly go like this : `` Can we get a Mara to play this part ? '' `` Sure , but technically that part should go to someone whose race is -- '' `` CAN WE GET A MARA TO PLAY THIS PART ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ''

1 `` Drinking the kool aid '' ? Do we really need to be quite so condescending ? Were talking about a movie not a political statement or something .

1 While I ca n't exactly recommend the movie , I was extremely impressed with how the plodding pacing perfectly reflected the fact that the main character was past his prime and struggling to keep up with the high speed espionage of the present day . The problem is , the viewer suffers to create that atmosphere .

1 There is no Ferris . Cameron is Ferris . Each time I see that film , I believe the Fight Club theory more and more .

1 not sure if `` The 'Burbs '' really qualifies as `` thought-provoking . '' Good movie none-the-less .

1 Current Box Office : 4.8 Million ^according ^to ^rotten ^tomatoes also showing a 4 on the critics meter and 38 on the audience meter

1 Yeah , either that or sexuality is not that big of a deal , and making stupid jokes about it should be fine .

1 Smallville went for 10 years , ( 2001-2011 ) had Superman Returns ( 2006 ) and Man of Steel ( 2013 ) during / shortly after . It will depend how good the movie is I guess .

1 So is this subreddit going into a circlejerk over CGI vs . practical effects again ?

1 Shaolin Soccer is a personal favorite of mine .

1 I 'm really pulling for Arnie to have that hit he needs now that he 's back , commercially and / or critically . I 'm really hopeful that this does well .

1 I 'm not hearing that . You have an alien hovering over your house . Prepare for a probing ...

1 Or the rivalry between Marcellus and Butch

1 you must be new here .

1 Damn dude . Its not really a movie that can be spoiled too much , so you do n't have to avoid the internet . Its a different kind of movie , though . The structure is unusual , so be prepared for that .

1 That 's a movie I 'm actually glad I held off on watching until later . I would 've hated it at 17 haha .

1 This is nothing . The final theatrical trailer will involve massive explosive shootouts , then Zuckerberg standing over the camera , taking aim , saying , `` Five hundred million people like this ! '' and pulling the trigger , with the gunshot coinciding with cut-to-black .

1 No Jano Fett is his grandpa , Jango is his dad .

1 I second that boner .

1 His was the first name I thought of when I saw this thread . He may not have the widest range as an actor , but the man knows how to pick a good script .

1 I 'd say it 's a toss up between Winter Soldier and GoTG which is arguably the most comic booky of them all

1 Like a ~~boss~~ director .

1 > humorous wit about it

1 I thought the moments just before he enters that thing , when he 's thinking about it , he 's got his fist up to his chin ... that 's some of the best acting I 've seen in a long time .

1 The username relevancy is astounding . I applaud you . Buddha - seeking enlightenment and catharsis Robot - in modern times

1 Yes .

1 I grabbed it for a gag gift exchange at Christmas and it was a huge hit . We all stopped what we were doing , popped it in , and sat around watching it while drinking .

1 Can you elaborate a little ? I can understand disliking this movie if you 're not a fan of that style of humour or the Lonely Island guys . But if you are that is quite the disconnect as I found this movie to be exactly the type you would expect from them . Sure it 's a parody of 80 's movies like RAD but it 's still got all the trademarks of The Lonely Island .

1 Thanks ! Which short was yours ?

1 That and doing a Holocaust movie .

1 I like this comment , which resists the need / urge to categorize them , which ultimately serves no purpose unless you are writing a * Cracked * article .

1 I 'm not entirely sure what point you 're trying to make by replying to your own comment like that , but okay .

1 Great analysis . What I loved most about the tank shots in this movie was the fact that the armor actually appeared to work and shots wiuld bounce and ricochet off the ground . It was n't just hit / miss . The ending battle was slightly cartoonish as far as German accuracy goes , but at least it was dramatic and satisfying .

1 I 'm going to have to go with skrulls as well . There is footage from a scrapped Avengers game based on the movie , and skrulls were an enemy .

1 Yes .

1 Welcome to stupidity . Take a pamphlet .

1 It was probably almost impossible to tell in standard definition .

1 Well they 're action movies , it 's not supposed to be hard to understand the plot . In a movie with a potentially confusing plot like Inception or Memento , it 's good to really solidly explain the premise so people can enjoy it without being confused . You could go the Primer route where it takes a minimum of 8 viewings to understand what 's going on , but most people do n't like that .

1 you sure hit the nail on the head with this one !

1 Rule : If you 're discussing a major plot point of a film ( or TV series , or book , or video game ) that somebody in the world has n't seen , then it 's a spoiler . Does n't matter if it 's * X-Men : Days of Future Past * or * Citizen Kane * . A spoiler is a spoiler . A person who has n't seen a film from 1941 has just as much of a right to figure out how the film ends on their own as someone who has n't seen a film from 2014 . If you are n't having a closed discussion between people who either have all seen the film or have expressed no interest in doing so ( and therefore do n't care about spoilers ) , then all spoilers should be prefaced with a fair warning for those who have n't seen the film . I do n't get why this is such a big deal to people , especially on Reddit , where we have a system * specifically designed to denote spoilers * . Just use the damn system !

1 From somewhere else . Get it

1 You make some good points . I do n't understand why you 're being downvoted .

1 * It 's okay * * it 's okay * * I love you . * * I love you Tommy ... *

1 > If you really do n't care about absorbing anything creative over a period of two hours , then yeah , no one else 's opinion matters . What 's `` creative '' to you ? How would you define `` fun '' ? Do you consider good fun to be worthless , and a waste of time ? Does everything you do have to have a deeper philosophical meaning to even be worth your while ? > Reviews for me are about making efficient use of my eyes and ears . You do that , then . I 'm not telling you what to do , of course . But realize that your comment pretty much praised your own subjective opinion , and dissed everyone else in the world as part of the majority for liking things you do n't like . Your opinion , when it matches with `` critics '' is good , but the collective opinion of everyone else is , in your words , `` pretty much useless '' . It 's that kind of mentality I just do n't agree with . I just do n't think I and my time are _that_ important , that I have to think so very hard about not wasting a second of it . If something 's fun , it 's fun . It really does n't have to be more complicated than that .

1 This , absolutely this . In fact , CityTV in Toronto used to play this movie twice in row , so people could figure it out the second time around .

1 yeah probably

1 Go away .

1 Yeah , it may well be . That sounds like the process at most of the animation studios - at Disney , Pixar and Dreamworks we storyboard and edit the film multiple times before it even gets to animation , get it in front of an audience as soon & often as possible , and like you said make course corrections . The list is n't so much Pixar 's rules as it is just stuff I picked up during the years I was working there , from colleagues and outside . I would say if Pixar has a rule , it 's this one : `` Story is king '' .

1 Yes , but whether or not it happens inside or outside the event horizon depends on the size of the black hole .

1 If ever a movie deserved to be seen in IMAX 3D , it was Pacific Rim .

1 Yup. In fact the T-Rex was n't even in the cargo bay when the ship left Isla Sorna . It was in that big cage thing on the back . You can see the cage is all ripped open when everyone is finding all the dead bodies . So the T-Rex woke up , broke out of its cage , killed everyone , and then was locked in the cargo bay by a dying crewman .

1 Melancholia . Also , do n't watch this movie if you 're already depressed .

1 What d'you wan na get * suuued * ?

1 Disney writers are just regular people , ya know . They read the same books , follow the same blogs , look at the same artwork , and watch the same movies as everybody else , often in the name of inspiration . Not that shocking to suspect someone watched that short , liked the concept , and went along with some good ol ' plagiarizing . They might 've even forgotten about the short film ( it came out 4 years ago ) , but 'came up with the idea ' , thinking it wholly original . It could simply be a case of accidental plagiarism .

1 Wow I totally spaced on him being in the Lego Movie ! He was SO much fun and his accent was perfect for the part . I love it when you can tell that actors have a good time doing their voiceovers and especially with him you could just feel it in his lines .

1 Strictly Book Universe here : In The Silmarillion ( Akallab ? th ) , it is stated that three of the nine were Numenorean lords . We also know the name of the second-in-command : Kham ? l , the Black Easternling ( who held Dol Guldur for Sauron in the second age ) .

1 Pretty sure they 've already got an Ezio movie on the books . Last I heard Michael Fassbender was going to be the star .

1 Just when I thought you could n't get any lower , you go and do something like this ... * AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF ! *

1 I said in my comment that it 's obviously just two people joking around . However , the article is trying to make the point that the jokes themselves reflect an unfortunate reality . The fact that `` other races do it about whites '' ( careful about forming an unnecessary dichotomy ) would also , arguably , reflect an unfortunate reality . My reaction when I read the emails was , `` What 's the big deal ? '' But the larger point about how the jokes reflect a structure to Hollywood that is racist in some aspects is a valid point . The article does not address that point well .

1 For those who are n't aware , the movie is Quick Change ; also co-directed by Mr. Murray himself .

1 `` What , perhaps , may be most surprising is that the business decision wasn ? t totally nonsensical . The Rescuers was , upon its initial release , extremely successful at the box office , excluding multiple re-releases . Whatever distaste or basic lack of adoration some people may have for Disney ? s xerographic output in the 1960s and 1970s , it ? s worth remembering that these were some of their most financially popular films . The prevailing critical consensus about these films may assume the films are unremarkable now , but the numbers don ? t lie : many people paid to see The Rescuers . Unlike many of Disney ? s classics , too , the formula at the heart of The Rescuers could be repeated easily enough so as not to offend the true believers .

1 People who demand answers are stupid ( sorry people ) . I would rather be asked an interesting question than being given a terrible answer . Besides , they have 2.5 hours to tell a story AND build a universe , if they tried to answer everything it would be just too dense to follow , better to just suggest things and let people think about them .

1 There is a Japanese track , but the subtitles are just the adapted script , not the original translation .

1 Written by someone who has never been through any serious emotional trauma and had a good therapist get them out of it . Textbooks only teach psychiatrists so much , and just like the douchebag in the film quoting his year 1 history book , this guy misses the core information . Truth is you do form a bond with your therapist , a bond of trust and if they push you it can demolish you like this . Guy writing the article just sounds like some know-it-all dick , who actually knows nothing . Ironically not unlike Will throughout a lot of the movie .

1 Maybe . He probably really fucking hates being millions of dollars in debt even worse though . Just sayin ' .

1 Batman v Superman v Ant-Man : The Legal Drama of the Century

1 It 's very apparent that you are unfamiliar with most , if not all of his work . He was a good writer , a phenomenal critic whether you agreed with him or not , and he contributed to his profession and impacted his field more than you will ever dream of doing in yours .

1 I do n't know if it 's one of the worst movies I 've ever seen ( you 're probably getting downvoted for saying that opposed to the rest of your post ) , but you mostly speak the truth . It was not a good movie .

1 Sorry , I suppose it 's not as interesting to others as it was to me .

1 Schinler 's list is THE definition of `` oh my god where is the gun '' kind of sad . Thats not the emotional release I 'm looking for . Thank you though .

1 I 'm more liberal than anything else , and I loved Zero Dark Thirty . I did not feel that it condoned torture at all . The scenes of torture are deeply disturbing and the film shows that its kind of an ineffective method . You can see that the main character is discomforted by the sight of torture , and I think the film simply wants to show that we * did * torture people in our past , but it does n't want to glorify or encourage it .

1 The english language voice acting for Sen was great .

1 I read it was $ 1m and only the sequence where he crashes through the building with all the glass .

1 * PILLLLLLLLLS ! ! ! *

1 That would only happen in they were owned by 65,000,000 people and had negative equity . Which they are n't .

1 Bateman is more of a villain protagonist though , he 's an awesome character but there is n't anything heroic about him .

1 Delta

1 They frequently give C3P0 shit . The only people who dont get made fun of or shit talked to for being as bumbling as Jar Jar are the mentally handicapped

1 Yet I still watch it week in and week out . It 's one of those tv shows with a huge potential if they 'd just kill off a couple of the main characters . No one substantial has died since season 1 and even then it was someone with really no relevance to the overall plot . Sure , killing off people is n't always the best move but this is a series based on a war against aliens . The likely hood of people dying every now and then should be much bigger than it is in Falling Skies . I sit in patience for that moment . Plus I 've never liked a tv show or movie where you end up yelling at the screen for them to realise something or do something differently / faster . As an Australian I see it all too often . If you 've ever seen any drama series to ever come out of Australia you 'd know exactly what I mean . The screen-writing is terrible and thus the show is terrible .

1 Which in turn is why the gospels fail to make a good exposition for Jesus . Terrible character arc , child to 30 instantly

1 aha

1 That 's great , bud !

1 no.. unless i really missed the point of the movie . his powers manifest in episodes of delusion like when he 's flying through the entire city to go back stage , and in the background is a taxi driver yelling at him for not giving him his fare . personally , i fuck'n loved the movie . i think most everyone past 20 or 30 can relate to failed expectations , an inability to cope , self-medicating , etc.. or maybe it 's just me lol .

1 Louie looks great in a cop uniform , I do n't know why but it suits him .

1 Honestly , and maybe this shows the fact that I 'm fast-approching 30 , but I could totally get down with the transformers movies if Bay would just throw me a wide shot so I knew what the fuck was going on once in a while . Otherwise , it 's just like op describes ; a bunch of metal flying around and me waiting for the end to find out which robot won .

1 Hey pal , regardless of what you think of the housing market , the original Nightmare was pretty darn good .

1 Ok we get it , you hate itunes and love Steam . But dont make up facts when you are wrong . iTunes has been around 2001 and has had the itunes store since April of 2003 . Steam has been around since September of 2003 . Why anyone is getting so worked up about with content distribution system someone likes is beyond me ...

1 The Hobbit , I think

1 Yeah ... its not gon na happen .

1 I was waiting for my all time favourite movie to be mentioned ! And also Sallys `` story '' . She fights for what she wants ( Jack ) even though there 's a lot of hardship against her . In the end , through all the bad , she ends up with Jack because she fought and believed .

1 Head like a fucking orange .

1 Would n't call it a disliked movie , just a film that 's sadly more remembered for what it beat at the Oscars ( * Apocalypse Now * and * All that Jazz * ) . Personally I think it 's a really simple yet powerful movie about a father having to take on the role as guiding parent after the mother leaves . You really feel Hoffman 's frustration but also the love for his son , and it grows into a flurry of complex emotions . Very much an actor 's movie , and a good one at that .

1 [ Also ] ( http : / www.cinepolisusa.com / ) they have some in the US . They 're not as inexpensive as listed above , though .

1 lol , just did it for fun , never done this before in PS , though i 've used PS for a long time : )

1 I 'd actually put Mask of the Phantasm above red hood , but the voice acting in red hood was better than any of the new dc films . Brian Cranston in year one is the only one I can consider close . I was blown away by how truly in depth red hood was , and it did a great job of streamlining the comic story line . I 'm so excited for the adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns

1 I think the thing that pisses them off the most is that it 's being marketed and pushed by critics as being a `` realistic '' portrayal of war .

1 testify brother .

1 Tom Cruise is THE MAN .

1 Unicorns , man . You never see them coming .

1 YOU BASTARD !

1 Captain America was fantastic too . Let 's not forget that !

1 I dont know if I like this . The Dark Knight was so heavily focused on Joker that it almost seemed like I wasnt even watching a Batman movie . I was more interested in Harvey Dent and the Joker all the way through . I want this to actually be a story about Bruce Wayne and how his legend ends just as Batman Begins was how his legend began .

1 Really ? It has some cheesy moments , but I thought that added to the darker moments . It served as mood whiplash .

1 lalalalala i cant hear you whats midichlorians

1 Yes . From Wikipedia : > In the 1975 film Dog Day Afternoon , Al Pacino 's character , Sonny , who is holding eight bank employees hostage , starts a chant of `` Attica ! Attica ! '' at the massed police outside , evoking the excessive police force used in response to the Attica riot . The chant `` Attica ! Attica ! '' has since been parodied or used for comedic effect in everything from children 's cartoons to crime procedurals .

1 You got that one right ... I see all these amazing shows Americans are losing that we never had in the first place .

1 Hmm , I was pretty sure the reason Quarantine 's ending got so much hate was because it was the route I thought , but clearly not . Honestly I like both endings . REC 's was much more real though based on performance , it had a much stronger impact . Hopefully REC3 ( the real sequel that 's coming up , not the spin off third film ) can end that turn and the franchise well .

1 I just realised he is the new Keanu Reeves .

1 Or Kevin James

1 It 's not really about pretension so much as it 's about letting the movie digest . Lots of modern movies get immediate inclusion on imdb 's top 250 , but then dwindle off as people lose the immediate interest . Just like how Oscar fodder is released in December . It 's typically bad form to watch a movie and instantly say `` The greatest film ever ! '' Let it marinate for a decade . See how it holds up .

1 Yes , but the point is that is n't canon . Lords of the Sith is the first * currently canonical * mention of it .

1 He got to raise his kids without being away all the time filming . I think that 's what really matters . Other people will make movies . Some things are more important .

1 Fucking spoilers , man . Not everyone has watched GotG already .

1 Disliking QT 's movies is one thing . Not everyone likes them and some people really * dis * like them . That 's a matter of taste , and taste is one of the few truly subjective things about human life . Asserting that people only like his films because they 're popular is reading motive into people you do n't know and is dismissive toward any * other * reason people might like his films . It 's also a little weird to say that `` people like it because other people like it '' . Where did the first people who like it come from ? And in such numbers that his movies are * really * successful in theaters ? I enjoy his characters , I enjoy his dialogue ( even when it goes on for twenty minutes ) . I think he does those two things exceptionally well . That is why I like his movies .

1 WAAAAAALLLLT

1 I 'm in this boat . Sort of . I 've come to terms with it being an ungodly mess of a movie but I still love it in a way that I 'll never love Donnie Darko . As for Darko itself , when I was fifteen it was my favorite movie but while it 's still a very well-done directoral debut I feel like it 's really designed to speak to people at Donnie 's age .

1 What year am I in ?

1 Until the movie started

1 Mugatu , from zoolander .

1 Fucking shut up about that shite .

1 There wasnt even an awning

1 Cash : bet him cash . Bet him lots of cash . Do it now .

1 Do n't be an ass . Williams had some great movies , a ton of great comedy , and was a good person in general . Yeah he had some bad movies , but most movies are bad , and who are we to judge him for being in bad movies ? Most of us would jump at the chance to be in any movie , and to make the money he did . It 's a tragedy that he died , even if his movies were bad . Even if he was a nobody it would be a tragedy and you should have some respect .

1 Space Jam with Brian Scalabrine instead of MJ .

1 It 's okay , but when you have mediocrity next to two of the greatest films ever made , it 's gon na look like a piece of crap . If Duvall had been involved like planned initially , it would have been the amazing .

1 `` I thought you might be concerned ... . about the location ... . of your shit ... . '' I fucking lost it there , lol .

1 I felt it was very suspenseful when everyone starts killing themselves and you have no idea why . I really wish more people in this sub were like you , and willing to discuss , or more importantly , let others have different opinions , instead of downvoting like it is their job .

1 ASM2 was a horrible movie . But it was a pretty decent music video !

1 Fight Club

1 I remember the first time I saw Bio-Dome like it was yesterday .

1 Yeah . The twist did nothing for me except make me scratch my head . I know it is a movie , but the motives for the protagonist were just silly to me . It just did n't `` wow '' me . For such an epic setup the twist just seemed pretty ... dumb .

1 I do n't care if this turns out to be the worst movie ever , it has freaking robot dinosaurs . I will be buying a ticket .

1 My dislike of Woody Allen knows no bounds . I boycott his movies . ( meaningless for him , I have no doubt , but makes me feel fine )

1 she sings purposely off key . That style , for me , can either capture attention and be kind of endearing or end up sounding like a cat in agony

1 Nooooooooooooo !

1 DOROTHY MANTOOTH IS A SAINT !

1 DALTOOON !

1 I ca n't see anyone else besides Fassbender playing David .

1 But I 'm asking him what * his * specific complaints are . Not the possibly different complaints of someone else .

1 Hey baby ; )

1 maybe they will move will to hardys role and get Jaden as deadshot ?

1 no

1 I 'm actually surprised so many people liked it . I thought it was terrible . I could n't even watch the whole thing it was so bad .

1 Andrew WK needs to be used in wayyy more trailers .

1 No , it does n't .

1 Nope . That 's The Winter Soldier . I was actually hoping to see Batroc in this trailer , though . As I 've yet to see what he 's going to look like in the movie .

1 Yep . And the point of the post is that I 'm having percentages thrown out against my choice simply by browsing a forum .

1 -ANAL_ASSASSAN

1 Are n't all 3 of them `` After-Earth '' type movies ?

1 Borat made me cry of laughing too hard . Does that count ?

1 I would n't exactly say it 's been lost to time , but it has undergone a drastic change in perspective . Most people still know about it , and film buffs still regard it as an example of excellent cinematography ( even if the subject matter is not regarded as excellent ) .

1 Irreversible

1 He 's the writer and producer , he also wrote Pineapple Express , Superbad and This is the End .

1 I think his bizarre personal life being highlighted only proves what a great actor he is . He is not playing himself on screen like so many actors often do .

1 Same . I went as Scream for Halloween for four straight years . Not sure if it was because my parents did n't want to get me another costume or I just liked it so much . Probably both .

1 The scene where he pulls a couple over for drugs is the best . Classic Nic Cage .

1 Friggin ' hate that crap .

1 If anything , under dramatic .

1 Scotty Does n't Know . Do n't tell Scotty ! Agreed .

1 If you look at the facial expressions on the two of them when they ride the bus into the future and beginning of a big mistake , The Graduate qualifies . Thats at least how I always viewed the end . It almost looks like they know they were caught up in the moment and even though theyll continue to be together , it will end badly .

1 No , they stickied it to let everyone know about it , and that they are aware of it , and that they are n't going to allow it to become `` drama '' that overruns the sub .

1 Yeah but he ca n't control those beings , he actually wants them out of his ocean .

1 Nope . Just like Snow Dogs , it 's a three minute dream sequence .

1 > And paintball episode of community ! Well , sign me the fuck up !

1 So its a spoiler ? Fuck him ... ..

1 It 's slightly creepy too . Seth 's joke about getting them together with drunk producers exposes the strangeness of the whole situation .

1 He said he paid for it . What more do you want ?

1 Pretty standard evolution of a dork that 's comfortable with being a dork .

1 Doing what she does in every movie . Provide unnecessary eyecandy .

1 Depending on when all of these come out I think Jurassic Park will be able to compete . I mean it 's considered almost a classic and a huge franchise . I know I for one will see the shit out of it

1 I hope they Keep this one more true to the actual book . They have so much potential , its such a shame when they get screwed up !

1 If youre gon na say a batman movie you should probably go with Batman & Robin .

1 Ah , the old Guardians of the Galaxy box office report . Long time , no see .

1 In Bruge was much more thoughtful and well crafted , and Seven Psychopaths was just a ton of fun . Both are good , though .

1 Yeah , sadly this post is pretty much useless as it is : (

1 I 'm a grown man who still fears Pennywise .

1 You trim out those moments and you lose the tension they build .

1 I loved the movie . It 's such a cynical look at celebrity culture ad the glorification of the dead . Plus that scene where he 's crying in front of the porno magazines made me cry from laughing and sadness at the same time . No other movie has ever made me experience two opposite emotions at the same time . haha

1 Kids choice awards

1 Just FYI - `` road trip movies '' means `` movies that are about a road trip '' like Tommy Boy , Little Miss Sunshine , etc . If you liked those three you mentioned , it sounds like you like movies about people becoming really successful but with trouble with the law / etc . Scarface Catch Me if You Can Goodfellas Wallstreet Boiler Room

1 Amen . Fitness is not a pipe dream .

1 Probably wanted to give a shout out to its homies in new port .

1 Hollywood assumes the audience is dumb . In turn , the audience grows dumber with each passing film .

1 It 's a pretty good movie , but it is very uncomfortable to watch . It 's a satire of torture / slasher movies that wants to tell the viewer they are a bad person for wanting to see people get killed . It makes a point of making itself unenjoyable to watch . For that reason , it is pretty interesting to talk about afterwards , but watching it is no fun .

1 Here , if you have a milkshake , and I have a milkshake , and I have a straw . There it is , that 's a straw , you see ? You watching ? . And my straw reaches acroooooooss the room , and starts to drink your milkshake ... I ... drink ... your ... milkshake !

1 Especially considering how well-written the source material was .

1 I thought about this too , you would think that if these ships are close enough to get pulled into Earths gravity then someone would have witnessed two ship shooting the shit out of each other .

1 That 's sufficient to interest me in * some '' movies , but the majority of the time it would be a list of names that did n't have any real meaning to me .

1 Yup , literally chose the `` poster '' option .

1 Maybe I 'm blissfully unaware , but unless The Blindside changed the gender of Michael Oher 's best friend in order to add a romantic interest , I do n't think it could be as bad as Patch Adams

1 Groot and Rocket were my favorite characters .

1 Since she already played in Machete Kills ( from the same director ) , I 'm not that surprised . She probably wo n't disguise as Anthonio Banderas this time though = (

1 Avi Arad is the fucker upper in chief at Sony . He 's to blame for why the Spider Man movies now are terrible .

1 Boyhood http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Boyhood_ ( film ) It was a pretty bold endeavor .

1 [ Spoilers ] ( # s `` The scene in the warehouse where the one guy pops out of his skin like a balloon scared the living shit out of me . '' ) The worst part ( or best part of experiencing it ) was I watched the movie at 2 AM with the lights off and alone . The only source of light was my laptop screen so pretty much besides my face , everything else was shrouded in the pitch black . As scared shitless as I was , I would rather watch it like that and be authentically scared than in the middle of day as my little sisters constantly bother me and distract me .

1 Kirk Cameron acted in Fireproof , but he was not involved in any of the writing or directing .

1 Amy and Tina mentioned that there was an actual Margaret Keane Big Eyes painting there and say we 'll show it now and cut to Emma Stone

1 Suprise me ...

1 Yeah we 've already had tons of bombs . Black hat , Mortdecai and now 7S .

1 That 's a lot . I do n't think more than 20 % of the population are capable of affording and interested in seeing `` movies '' in theaters .

1 I disagree . His eyes were SO expressive ; `` any muscled actor '' could n't have conveyed so much with so little .

1 In your opinion .

1 Payne is from Nebraska ...

1 Nice try , Steve Oedekerk

1 Source ?

1 I 'm still very much in the interview / research process and am learning new thing all the time . The best book I 've found on the subject is Shelley Adler 's 'Sleep Paralysis . '

1 It 's screening , but out of competition .

1 No . I read this as `` Hey , Marvel has taken a shot at making a variety of different characters into feature length films , and DC sticks to pretty much Supes and the Bat . ''

1 I 'm just saying , if you 've made it clear you have no frame of reference , then why do you keep debating ? Not being informed gives a weak argument . Maybe the `` tribalism '' has more to it than just cannibalism . Possibly you are the subtly racist one for assuming the two are connected ?

1 Duuuuuuuuuude ! ! ! ! YEEEESSSS ! ! ! !

1 Friend says he heard this movie is funny as hell . Its about a foreigner in America , fake documentary thing . ( Borat ) Did n't remember the name , then sees a title and says that must be it . Three tickets and popcorn later , a night of terror begins . Norbit starts

1 so he is n't jerry seinfeld

1 That would be amazing especially if they stay close to the comic , at least the first issues . The crumbling psyche of a superman was great .

1 I can second this one as well , I 've been reading a bunch of their stuff lately .

1 The bullets were slowing down . They only struck a few feet below the surface . After that depth , they just sink .

1 * There Will Be Blood * is an excellent film that just had the misfortune of coming out in a strong year for movies . ( Same goes for * Michael Clayton * and * Juno * . ) But * No Country for Old Men * is a masterpiece . I agree with the Academy more in 2007 than just about any other year .

1 it doesnt matter if you 're selling paper or conquering earth , dont be fooled , there is only sex

1 Wait , but broadcast TV has been doing that for decades . All the animated graphic overlays during sports casts and news programs and such .

1 So what about Iron Man ?

1 Whoa !

1 thank you ! exactly

1 pacific islander if Im not mistaken

1 Absolutely . The guys only 26 or 27 and is getting better with every film . He has a starring role next to Deniro coming out in the next couple of years .

1 Not this time

1 Yes .

1 Every JP movie is PG-13 .

1 The term for these rants are `` Kermodean '' .

1 I think one the best parts of the CGI here was that all of the action scenes were really choreographed and instead of the quick cuts of many modern movies we get to see more of what 's happening .

1 Chris Kyle , American Psycho

1 Exactly , just because theres a mystery does n't mean its immediately a good film .

1 He plays Ultron [ Fake spoilers ] ( # s `` when he becomes a real boy . '' )

1 Who does he think he is ? Spike Lee ?

1 Oh a little of this , a little of that ... If you 're really curious you should watch the show . It 's good .

1 You must really like Bruce Campbell , huh ? Ca n't argue with that actually , guy 's a badass .

1 Ah , the good old Twin Peaks trick . `` Let 's rock ! ''

1 Alright , /r/moviescirclejerk , which one of you created this alt ? ! Answer me !

1 `` * Farther * : used to indicate the extent to which one thing is distant from another . '' `` * Further * : To a more advanced point . To a greater extent . '' So it 's possible they 're not refering to distance .

1 Birdemic !

1 His character in Snatch is still my favourite . Partly because he 's not just the same action hero badass type like in most of his recent roles .

1 He 's got a much wider range than that .

1 `` You 've had alterations to two different chromosomes . '' The Bourne Syndrome .

1 As a Georgian , I 'm also happy !

1 I want these kind of movies done with the flair of an old Jackie Chan movie . I ca n't really expect to get some Who Am I with every action movie , but I like the style . I 'd love to see stunt people this talented in much bigger roles .

1 So : affluenza ?

1 Darth Vader gets redeemed

1 `` You see , in this world there 's two kinds of people my friend : Those with loaded guns , and those who dig ... You dig '' . It really is a masterpiece , as far as I 'm concerned the final scene in the cemetery in the greatest 10 minutes in Cinema history .

1 100 % sober and I liked that part , too . Fuck people , like what you like and do n't be ashamed to admit to it .

1 You my friend work at a family video . I guess I too am stuck in the past . I still rent movies and games from my local store . We even have a pizza place in the same building with a walk up window from the movie store . Order your food then browse around for movies and games .

1 No but Edward Norton does .

1 Oh my god . Frodo sucked off Samwise and we never knew ... Kevin Smith was right ...

1 There 's a scene in the record shop where he takes a call and writes down an address to go look at the records . That 's all that 's mentioned of it though , and it 's not major . Him going to the house to look at the records was a scene in the movie , though .

1 I do n't see how reason A translates to conclusion B . Kind of a dumb thing to let get in your way of enjoying it .

1 Yeah ... can someone fuck start this guys head

1 Honestly I think more movies need space Zeppelins I ca n't think of a single movie that would n't be better off with them .

1 There is no guilt in Wayne 's World ...

1 I swear to God I just put it together that he also played Dick Jones in Robocop . Mind blown .

1 He was cast in Saving Private Ryan because Stephen Spielberg saw the dramatic short film he wrote , directed , and starred in called Multifacial .

1 Fucking Tyrone .

1 You must be a joy at parties .

1 Until the next time Spike Lee speaks and then woosh goes the pendulum

1 Tim Burton : `` Anyone who knows me will tell you that I would never read a comic book . '' Kevin Smith : `` Which , I guess , explains Batman . ''

1 The army literally did make a game thats free called Americas Army 3 so anyone can play it and be like `` I wan na do this for real ! '' But there is in fact a difference I see American Sniper as an antiwar / Prowar film showcasing PTSD and readjustment to normal life while showing why we are fighting the war and justifying the killing

1 The original novel is called All you need is kill

1 Pan 's Labyrinth .

1 The Big Sleep

1 You missed the point so hard .

1 Dude karma is an illusion , do n't let it get in the way of your opinions .

1 I honestly could n't disagree with you more . There are effectively two Godzilla movies that have a soul , this one and the original . Almost every other Godzilla movie was terrific fun and entertainment , but seriously sacrificed any kind of meaning ( except for Final Wars which was about just enjoying how awesome Godzilla is ) . I seriously have trouble comprehending how you could be comparing this movie to the 1998 `` version . '' That movie was a painfully idiotic rehash that focused on unlike-able characters and an idiotic series of events . No where in this movie does Godzilla get tricked by a pile of fish or tied up and killed in a bridge . Perhaps you missed the shot at the Broderick film . One reason Godzilla effectively smashed the Golden Gate bridge with almost no effort is because in the 1998 he literally got caught up and died in a bridge - sort of the director 's way of saying `` you had no idea what this character is about . '' This movie focuses on the errors of humanity coming back to haunt them . Bryan Cranston 's character is a representation of that - he does n't push hard enough for something he knows is important , and then he ignores his wife 's dying wish ( that he take care of their son ) and instead degenerates into a correct paranoid loon . Cranston 's performance was perfect and did exactly what it needed to do . Taylor-Johnson was amazingly accurate as a soldier who is simply trying to do his duty but has some severe emotional problems . I encourage you to watch the film again , watch his scenes closely . Whenever he 's around his father or his wife , he is initially very uncomfortable because he starts `` feeling . '' However , as time passes again with both characters , he starts to open up . By the end of the film he is able to show emotion to his wife as he has learned that his family is more important than his duty - he ca n't end up like his father . There are also two issues I take with you suggesting Godzilla was n't the focus of the movie . First : Yes he was , Ken Watanabe 's character spends the entire film obsessing over Godzilla and explaining that HE is the only real solution to the problem . Certainly you 're correct in that Godzilla is n't on-screen for extended periods , but again , he is clearly the focus . And why would n't the MUTOs be given screen-time ? Two things were on-going throughout this movie : building up the desire to see Godzilla fight , and establishing that the MUTOs were viable threats . Be honest , the first time you see the male , you were immediately thinking ... '' Well that 's just kind of a large bug , it should n't be too much trouble . '' Right ? So if we the audience do n't see that their powers and destructive capabilities are really something not simply dangerous but beyond humanity 's capability , how are we to look forward to Godzilla fighting them ? Second , Godzilla is the focus because he is ever-present , he hangs over the film like the force of nature he is being portrayed as . At first he is unseen , but once he is revealed the rest of the film is fully concerned with where he 's going and what he 's going to do when he get 's there . Finally tone : this movie 's tone was only slightly less dark than the original and perhaps had to be . Still , it was nowhere near as goofy as most of the other Godzilla films and light years away from the tone of the Broderick version . This movie effectively says that there are going to be consequences for humanity constantly thinking it can mess with nature / the environment / science etc. , and that those consequences might be something we can neither bomb away or contain . So respectfully , I disagree .

1 A lot of people , including myself , do n't have the time nor patience to sit in a theater for four hours . If a movie needs to be split for content , then let them because both parties end up benefiting . The viewers do n't have to sit in a dark theater for four hours , and the producers make more money because it 's two movies .

1 This . This so much .

1 I demand to be considered for the title role in 'Hideous Man ' . My reasoning is two-fold : 1 ) Am man 2 ) Am hideous Thank you for your consideration .

1 He just does n't seem to give a shit anymore , which is a shame because once upon a time he made really good comedies .

1 Thanks for this ! So interesting to see how news reporting / celebrity coverage has changed over the years . Considering this was one of the biggest films of all time the atmosphere almost seems subdued !

1 I mean the book by James Joyce . Big difference .

1 & # 3232 ; \_ & # 3232 ; I 'm not sure who is the `` little shit '' in that situation , I was n't aggresive at all .

1 Turns out billy connoley had health problems or something ... like , parkinsons or alzheimers or something , and he could n't properly do the job of playing Dain Ironfoot . For whatever reason , the production did n't want to hire another actor to play the part , so they CGI 'd Connolly . He looks sorta like CLU from tron : Legacy now . I 'm sure the special features will explain it all , if anybody other than me bothers to watch them .

1 > and no one decides they should investigate how Bruce Wayne went bankrupt after that hostage situation ? How do you know there is no investigation ? Lucius even says that it 'll be sorted out at some point but it 'll take some time

1 I loved that , so much . He looks at him , and can just * tell * that Loki is too much chaos , and too dangerous .

1 The movie is a love letter to existentialism with a side of showing it 's over indulgence . The point i took away was that life is whatever you make it . If you do n't connect with the people around then life is just pointless and needlessly chaotic . If you do connect with everyone you can see the potential in everything and everyone and in yourself . All that fits in to Humanism quite well which is main philosophy in life . I too love this film , even though I do n't think O'Russell is that good of a director . He picks good movies to be involved with . This film was his baby from start to finish so I can appreciate that .

1 I think that the John Carter stories have so much potential . But the movie they made , in my opinion , was not good . I think that the characterization was weak and the plot had too much going on with too much action . BUT I want them to make another one because the idea is great .

1 The number of lines indicates why not to make a first one : there 's enough of them already .

1 How was the first one American propaganda specifically ? While it did n't criticize America , it seemed to portray * every * nation in a positive light , including Germany .

1 Not to mention god damn there are some bad JP Godzilla movies .

1 Oh yeah ? Of what origin ?

1 Well , Flash is typically several orders of magnitude faster than Quicksilver , but in DoFP Quicksilver was much faster than he normally is without any sign of having to strain himself , so it 's hard to guess what his limit is there Then again Flash 's abilities are more than just `` goes fast '' because of the whole speedforce thing ( e.g. he would n't have to brace someone 's neck to prevent whiplash ) so probably still Flash

1 I wish somebody would go back a make Jurassic Park , but this time match the tone of the book . Probably one of my favorite books . But man , I hate the gee-whiz perspective that Spielberg adds to so many of his films .

1 Cracked is like a porn site for contrarians .

1 I just like how they 'll be different . Marvel 's is less powerful but more magical effect to him . He also will get more screen time and more of an arc . From creation , to villain , to hero . ( Plus he 's interacting with his sister ) XMen 's seems more fun , powerful and great use of slow-mo and frames per second . ( and the nice hint to Magneto being his father )

1 AMA request : Meryl Streep ?

1 I really do n't think you understand Magneto , at all . He is a Jew that went through the Holocaust , and this is shown right at the beginning of the film , where he is separated from his parents . He and his family are among a group of people who are being rounded up and killed simply for being different than anyone else . And who was responsible for the Holocaust ? Humans . Humans killing other humans , simply because these other humans were different . This is where humans treat him badly . This is where his hatred for humans is based . His hatred of humans is only furthered when they fire upon him and his group on the beach . They are the heroes , they just saved the day . And their thanks ? * BOMBS * Bombs are their thanks . They are fired upon because they are feared for their powers . Feared because they are different . It becomes similar to what Magneto experienced as a child , as a Jew in Nazi Germany . Being hated for being different . And it is all the mutants there , not just the bad guys who are fired upon . They have no quarrel anymore , because Shawn is dead and now the humans are trying to kill them . The enemy of my enemy is my friend . That is why he goes off with them , there is no need for theme to fight anymore . The reason Magneto hates humans is because of what happened to him as a child . People tried to kill him simply for being different . This is why he `` sentences all of humanity to death because one ship followed orders and tried to blow up the island '' , because the mutants are the new Jews . They are now the group that everyone is trying to eradicate , the group that everyone is trying to get rid of . Having already gone through the Holocaust , he knows how humans can act towards one another , and tries to get rid of them before they do the same to mutants . He is just trying to protect 'his ' kind . As for the `` following orders line '' , I 'm pointing back to the Holocaust . Any day he could have been killed ( at least before Bacon ) , just because he was Jewish . Any day , someone could have ended his life , just because they were following orders . This is why he reacts by killing them , because he knows that the persecution of mutants will not end with his death . The way he sees it , is that he needs to be the one to fight for mutant kind by trying to get rid of humans . Otherwise , it will be no different than what happened in the Holocaust . This is why he tries to get rid of the senator in X1 , he wants to pass laws against mutants , because he is afraid of their powers , afraid of them . He tries to kill all humans in X2 because of Striker . Striker wants to kill all mutants because of his son . He is afraid of him and his powers . And who is Striker working with ? The government . He works with the government to kill off a group of people simply for being different to humans . Sounds like the Holocaust right ?

1 fuck that ! i enjoyed way too much to give it back !

1 Same here . They complimented each other well . BH was like a dessert to the big dinner of interstellar

1 I thought Melancholia had a happy ending . The calmness with which Justine faces the inevitable collision of Earth with Melancholia is truly admirable . The change occurs about halfway through the film when she accepts her fate and life . The contrast between her calm and serene attitude and Claire 's frantic , stressful and fearful attitude in the end of the film was just beautiful . Sidenote : I really think this film can not be fully realized and appreciated if one has not gone through depression himself / herself for Lars captures that mind state perfectly .

1 Screening at the AMC in the same building I work in . Because we 're in that building we get sent screening passes to pretty much all Universal films . A couple of coworkers and I have gone to about 6-10 in the last couple of years , and usually see some of the movies about 3-5 weeks before release ... . so it 's kinda cool .

1 Amen . The kid deserves every award in the book .

1 > I will be your Sherpa up the mountain ... of gayness That has to be one of the greatest lines ever . I so rarely get to use it in everyday conversation .

1 The 52 redesign * was * in this . He appears at 1:30 and fights Darkseid . Just because you were n't attentive to the video does n't mean Zack Snyder messed up .

1 Agreed . Marvel is doing great at the funner side of the superhero genre , I would love a Justice League that 's polar opposite , bit more serious , bit darker . What 's the point in them both playing the same angle ? And one other thing , imagine a Justice League movie with this level of cinematography and score ? Those are the weakest points of the Marvel movies right now , ( which I love regardless ) , bland cinematography , and scores that I can barely remember five minutes after watching it .

1 Fackin Mick Taylor !

1 ... have you seen the movie ?

1 I always thought this book would make a great Premium Cable series .

1 Woah , you think it can be as good as The Room ? That movie was just amazing you know .

1 Now with Cylons !

1 Netfliix got the rights to show it but not the rights to the sound

1 I think he was funnier in Boogie Nights . He was just so earnestly gay for Mark Wahlberg !

1 do n't just stare at it , eat it

1 Then do n't watch it ? Not sure what to tell you .

1 It is n't about making it work . Its about adapting the story so that they can do something different . Maybe this movie is n't about him `` getting the girl '' . Maybe its about his life being so dull and dreary that he does n't believe he is adventurous or interesting enough . I 'm not usually one to say this about authors , but in this case I 'll make an exception . Who cares what Thurber intended ? His story is out there and was already adapted into a film that follows the story closely . I 'd like to see someone do something new with the story . Besides , if Fight Club ( and The Shining if I recall correctly ) taught us anything its that adaptations of stories can sometimes be better than the original . I obviously do n't know if this 'll be better . I doubt it , but I still believe it 'll be a fantastic movie and a great adaptation to the original story . To say that its missing the boat would imply that you think they 're trying to follow the original which I think is n't the case .

1 trailers should not exceed 3 minutes . I just saw that whole movie .

1 Inception is all _about_ questioning reality . There are at least two scenes where a character thinks what 's happening is real , then it turns out to be a dream . On top off it , the entire plot is about convincing a person that a dream is real . I literally ca n't think of a subject that 's better suited to an ambiguous ending .

1 For a fleeting moment on-screen , sure . For their entire careers ? Doubtful .

1 Fassbender was fucking great in that role , do n't know why you 're expecting downvotes .

1 oops ...

1 I DO N'T ROLL ON SHABBOS ! ! ! !

1 Is that their real names ? ? I honestly do n't know .

1 SHUT YOUR MOUTH ! ! ! KEVIN BACON TAUGHT A TOWN TO DANCE ! ! ! ! !

1 if its a good film they shouldnt need to know all this before hand though . if any piece of art requires explaining then that art isnt as strong or refined as it could be . sure , some people are just dumb and will miss the point no matter what but if the context is lost because you dont have a guide then thats a weakness .

1 pierce ...

1 `` I 'm Ron Burgundy ? ''

1 pretty accurate

1 I think that 's a little dubious . But it certainly felt a bit * odd * at the end of the film .

1 Hot Fuzz 2 : Words , the fuck do they mean ?

1 Pretty sure he was n't just `` stoned '' .

1 /r/conspiritard Nobody cares

1 You 're confusing short memory with incompetence and conservative management - oh , and a massive industry where everyone wants the next easy paycheck or residual .

1 Dude , have you watched TNG ? The Federation is probably one of the nicest SF cultures ever put on film , but I would n't step in a holodeck for 10 times my weight in Orion slave girls . They fail more often than XBoxes , but the failure mode is that the Flood manifests in your living room and actually kills you .

1 It 's not quite as basketball-y as the mask from the new Spider-Man .

1 Them being so overt with it actually had the opposite effect for me . Up until the final moment , I was n't really sure if they were going to go fully through with it .

1 Not a single star warred against another . False advertising .

1 I 'm with you man . This guy must 've been taking notes .

1 Go home , apostrophe .

1 Back to the futire trilogy

1 Just like blond vs . blonde

1 Until next year when `` Xylophone 's Curse '' finally comes out .

1 This is the one I was hoping to see . For his age , he really stood on his own , and put an effort into his performance that 's uncommon among child actors in dramatic roles .

1 * Men In Tights * is fantastic !

1 I actually checked afterwards in case I was wrong but there is no way Johanssan is 100 lbs . she 's about 125 according to that site .

1 Feige confirmed the Gauntlet seen at the end of AoU is different from the one in Odin 's Vault . And Thanos is not in Asgard . http : / www.slashfilm.com / mcu-infinity-gauntlets-thanos /

1 That part was not nearly as emotional for me as the scene where they got off the first planet and Cooper watched 23 years of his kids life in recorded messages ... so fucking heartwrenching .

1 The guy or Howard ? 'cause Howard is chillin ' with the collector .

1 or as in KnightFall - Bane breaks Batmans back - Joseph Gordon Lewitt as Jean Paul Valley takes over the mantle but ends up mad - Batman returns for a final showdown with Bane and / or Jean Paul .

1 /r/Juxtasubs I do n't want to inundate /r/movies with this trend , so if you 're interested in it , I guess let 's see if we can make a subreddit work ! Cheers .

1 Worst novelty account ever

1 The worst thing about the Nic Cage meme is a lot of people think it 's ironic . I genuinely believe that when he 's put in the right film he 's a seriously great actor . He 's done some amazing films .

1 Geez frack

1 I saw dark knight at an aquarium .

1 [ A little context . ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/AskReddit / comments / 1yfsaz / what_is_the_worst_mainstream_movie_you_ever_saw / cfk86gc )

1 So I mutter sayings from this film all the time , one of which is `` What do you think of that , hey ? '' ( Sultan to the Baron , about a bottle of wine ) - to which the Baron replies `` ... .not bad '' My son only realised where I 'd gotten it from when I put the movie on for him and his sister - that would have been last year when he was 7 . Now fast-forward to this year - we take them to Disneyland Paris , and I take him on the Aerosmith Rock'n'Rollercoaster , and as we took off ( it really * goes * ) , I had that panic 'I made a mistake , uh , too late ' moment - and then realised I 'd taken * my son * on this thing . I looked around , but could n't even see his nose sticking out from the big bars that drop down to hold you in ... .so I shouted , as we flew around the track in semi-darkness , `` WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT , HEY ? '' . The answer back was `` NOT BAAAD ! '' . And at that moment , I knew he 'd be OK .

1 We trust you , revel in the karma glory my friend

1 Do n't go in with your hopes very high . It 's pretty pretentious and there 's a lot of masked circle jerking that ends up essentially being `` DAE Felini ? '' Still a lot better than /r/movies as far as discussion goes ( I go to /r/movies to get pictures and news , as opposed to discussion or critique ) .

1 The other Indiana Jones movies that you grew up loving are still there though . Your childhood is fine , I promise

1 Too much range .

1 Oh , I disagree . You should watch the whole movie before you judge that scene . May not be your taste , but it was powerful to me when I first saw it .

1 They 're really good . TCW 's first season has some kiddish moments but overall the series takes some dark turns . Especially for a `` kids show '' . Rebels is pretty good so far .

1 Interesting . The first time I saw the movie I felt that way a tad , but after re-watching it 3-4 more times , I 'm very satisfied with the ending .

1 The realistic , edgy and dark thing just does n't work for Fantastic Four . The tone of this movie looks like it completely misses the mark in terms of the characters and the tone of the comic book .

1 I think you misread the title , it asked what the * worst * movie you 've watched three times was , not the best .

1 As much as I LOVE Pinky and The Brain , I think Freakazoid would translate to the screen a lot better .

1 Kevin Bacon is n't just a fan . Kevin Bacon is a hero .

1 * THE SALMON MOUSSE ! *

1 Agreed . Nothing frustrates me so much as when someone defends a plot hole by saying , `` no , it 's okay because this world has magic in it '' . Magic existing in a world is n't a pass to throw all logic out the window .

1 One of my favorite books and I would have loved Gilliam to direct it , but I do n't think any studio would have trusted him with the money needed to make this film .

1 Dominatrix dungeons .

1 Loved Pandorum .

1 That was as of May 8th . If we assume that he has stayed clean since then , it 's actually 1,579 days ( go Jason ! ) EDIT : And GO Kevin for never giving up on Jason !

1 Now THERE 'S a scoop o ' ice crame .

1 The best part about the Tom Bell charcter is that his mind was always working on the case and you could see it , at one point he was telling a story to Carla Jean and he references the machine they use to kill cattle , a bolt thats pushed out with compressed air . He says this to her not realizing that he has just figured out Chigurs killing method , because it was his subconscious that figured it out and he never did put 2 and 2 together . Thats completely backward from typical hollywood logic where the cops are always 'super genius sleuths ' who make all the connections somehow and always wrap everything up into a neat little ball at the end . In this case its just something the old cop will ponder on for the rest of his life , never quite understanding the meaning of it all and questioning whether his lifes work , something he was prepared to die for , was all for nothing .

1 [ Great find ! ] ( http : / imgur.com / b7pPi )

1 Berenger was good in Major League .

1 They were n't all trannies , just that one fellow that could n't risk pissing in a lavatory with a broken latch . The rest were a bunch of shrill women .

1 And they believe they are embroiled in the armageddon war for their Sky Father God . Whereas ours often believe in Science and not torturing people .

1 But Jackson never said `` it worked . '' Nothing except OP 's headline says it worked . Jackson said it was an opportunity to end on a cliffhanger , and that other movies and TV series have had waits longer than one year .

1 I 'd argue the first 10 even more so .

1 Considering the whole point of the movie was him trying to reunite and live with his kids ... yes .

1 Not the same year as any of those .

1 He 's one of the leads in penny Dreadful , one of the best shows on TV .

1 I do recommend seeing it as you will appreciate good movies even more after watching such a shit film .

1 Fox still owns Deadpool .

1 It 's true . Though some of the performances were poor . But I tend to attribute that to writing / directing more than the acting itself since most of the actors have done quality work outside the Star Wars franchise .

1 > Doctor Ctrl + F `` Doctor '' Check .

1 Eh . That was basically nerds as stereotypes for comedic effect . OP 's point is that Hollywood does n't like to just accept the premise and run with it without winking . X-Men making fun of their outfits , for instance .

1 Only if it is in my hometown . If it is a major landmark like the Statue of Liberty or Grand Canyon , no .

1 [ Big Trouble In Little China ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0090728 / ) , This is literally my definition of an 80s movie . The star is jacked , there is smoke everywhere , everything looks really fake , and there is always techno music playing in the background .

1 And a different name . Huge clue that it was another planet .

1 Saw it at Sundance , as I 'm a big fan of Chan-wook Park . The guy could film your mother taking a 2 and 1 / 2 hour dump and I 'd probably watch it . The film is n't bad , it 's not on par with the Vengeance trilogy , but it is n't terrible . Looks great , some fine performances , story was okay . I think if you enjoy his style you 'll probably enjoy the film .

1 I 'm pencilling him in for the 40 Year-Old Virgin remake in 2030 .

1 It was great on the big screen , but not really an effects-driven film so I would n't be concerned .

1 FACT : The only difference between Travis Bickle and Batman is money .

1 shut up norrin

1 Espiecially Emma Watson

1 To me it just ruined the slow building tone of the film . For the first two thirds , I do n't think I ever felt deaths in a film as much as Sunshine . Every time a character was killed off you felt the emotional weight the rest of the other characters felt . When you get like 3 characters killed off screen in a few minutes , it just feels like bodies thrown at you for shock value . It made the ending so dull .

1 Nice try , Disney

1 I feel the same way about scrubs . The end of the relationship also involved large amounts of my bones being crushed and destroyed . I consider that pretty much on the same level as watching all of that thing .

1 I ca n't stand Will Farrell , and find him borderline unwatchable . And think he ruins everything he 's been in . That being said , Stranger Than Fiction is one of my favorite movies .

1 Bale = batman , batman =\= bale .

1 Hey-Oh !

1 I agree . My wife loves that movie , so it 's on in my house all the time . Bullock did an excellent job , and totally deserved to win for her performance .

1 > Lundgren . > Rocky IV : 1 APOLLOOOOO

1 Yes ?

1 Honestly Scarface is good but overrated . I prefer the scene when Michael caps Sollozzo and McCluskey at the restaurant . It was a defining moment in his character . When he went from war hero to mobster .

1 No shit . It means `` I am not a member of the group in which you have included yourself , '' and in this context , that group is under-evolved humans .

1 IIRC it was the crystal at the heart of the city and the smaller ones that they wore around their necks that let them live that long .

1 And RDJ in NBK for that matter .

1 Star Wars was also in the arcade early in the movie

1 I 've always thought that The Darjeeling Limited was a really deep movie about brotherhood . I guess it helps that I have brothers exactly like the ones in the film .

1 There are going to be posts like this every day until the movie is released .

1 I do n't know , the original was not very immersive for me . It could also be that I 'm a picky prick .

1 Cloud Atlas - arthouse ? Hilarious .

1 John Malkovich is the impersonator . As himself , not as a character being Johnny Depp .

1 Yeah , Spider-man 3 really dragged the franchise down .

1 watch it with commentary- tina fey makes some funny lindsay comments

1 [ Mhhhmm ] ( http : / gifsoup.com / webroot / animatedgifs4 / 1342873_o.gif )

1 False , Jaws spawned the summer blockbuster

1 Friend , I think you 're missing it . Excalibur is the original Arthurian legends that the very ( questionable , and debated ) existence of King Arthur is based on . Maybe a matter of taste . I personally read the Hobbit and found it entertaining . But the LOTR movies ? My god . The CGI , the talking trees , the entrusting of a quest upon rests the survival of the world to a bunch of midgets with hairy feet , who eat 6 times a day . I ca n't make it through the first movie . But Excalibur ? An example : * `` But the cliff , the sea ? '' * * `` Your lust will hold you up ! You will float on the Dragon 's breath ! Ride ! '' * That , followed by real titties , bangin while wearing a suit of armor , like a boss . All next to a roaring fireplace the size of wall ! I 'll take that badass shit over midgets complaining about not getting breakfast any day .

1 Second and Third are dogshit . First one is awesome . Fourth one was a fun . It felt like almost direct sequel to the first one . But Fast Five is on another level of awesome . Like on the level of awesome that I expected for Nick Fury to be in the after credits scene asking Dominic Torretto to join The Avengers .

1 Its on Netflix Streaming right now . For anyone curious who does n't know about it , its a 1996 movie about a true story of two man eating lions who are claimed to have killed 135 workers on a British train line in Kenya in 1898 , the Tsavo Man Eaters : [ http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Tsavo_Man-Eaters ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Tsavo_Man-Eaters ) The movie stars Val Kilmer , Michael Douglas , and Tom Wilkinson . Its a lot of fun but certainly a bit dated in its storytelling style . But its an interesting story with enough historical truth behind it and interesting enough characters with good performances that I think its worth the time to watch . Trailer : [ https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ncG6epwTlEE ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ncG6epwTlEE ) That trailer is also kinda dated , so maybe a better way to show its merits is a couple of clips : [ https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ORTcApj26RQ ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ORTcApj26RQ ) [ https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=vyb55MXi7S0 ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=vyb55MXi7S0 ) Its basically a less-well-made * Jaws * , but with lions instead of a shark . Douglas is Quint . Kilmer is kind of a Brody / Hooper .

1 Ip man is great

1 I liked her in THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW a lot !

1 And Marshal from HIMYM . And the inverse of Barney from HIMYM .

1 Yeah , I know that . I 'm hoping they find another actor to play the Joker . Katie Holmes was replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal . It 's not outside the realm of possibility to get more Joker .

1 I 'm glad that you can see into the future .

1 That would be awesome . I was bummed that I did n't see this guy in Fury Road . http : / imgur.com / mbEyuEu And I kind of wish he had a dog again .

1 ... And Tuna upon rye bread !

1 Which is why he stand out more when he plays against type .

1 yup

1 ANd how many set accidents occur in other films , but are very rarely mentioned , or become such wide knowledge , unless its mentioned in an itnerview or dvd commentary ? Whilst I was working in the bar I used to work at one night a fellow employee cut her hand open , the chef burnt his arm on the grill and I dropped a keg on my foot . That was a cursed night ... oh wait , no , they were all accidents . My point is , these are just accidents that I am sure happen all the time , that have been inflated via a stars 'injury ' or a death , or two , some of which do n't even take place during the films 'time ' but years later .

1 yup .

1 YESSS ! It 's been a fucking while . I had almost given up on hope by now . I do n't think it is going to happen . Come on Rock , make it happen .

1 The poster you 're responding to did n't really quote Ebert 's review of Midnight in Paris , he quoted another ebert review of another movie .

1 Lol , that 's cuz that how they really talk xD

1 > corny stuff like `` Ferris Bueller '' I laughed . I 'd love for you to share with all of us your favorite films . And what year you were born .

1 Yeah please do . Either way I think the toes line is much better , the whole point in that scene was the players psyche outs being lame and terrible 'dick in the ass ' does n't go as well with his earlier crappy attempt of yelling 'miss it miss it '

1 classic paul dano

1 no

1 * What ? * Spiderman 2 is up there as one of the best superhero movies around , while TASM 2 is easily one of the worst . It nailed Spidey 's wit , I 'll give it that , but they are terrible ! There 's no proper narrative or plot , just a series of scenes hamstrung together . I do n't know if Raimi returning would work or not , but I 'd happily and eagerly wait to see .

1 Have you read to the Interstellar part ?

1 Reddit ! = ABC / Oscars

1 It definitely did n't have much of a compelling story , but all of the things I was hyped about before it came out ( action , visuals , and music ) exceeded my expectations . And while the script was n't amazing , there 's one line from the trailer that still gives me chills . > `` Alan , you 're acting like I 'm gon na find him sitting there working . Just , 'Hey kiddo , lost track of time . ' '' > `` Would n't that be something . ''

1 What does that have to do with the quality of the movie ? If it 's not your genre , it 's not your genre , but that has nothing to do with the movie itself .

1 If this is true ... Well lets just say i 'm probably going to masturbate to it .

1 * Europa Report * is mostly solid .

1 Apparently they thought when Superman said `` there 's always a way '' , he was referring to murder .

1 I think it takes a lot of artists of different art forms to make a movie . You have writers to write the script and actors for acting . There are musicians who make the soundtrack and photographs who deal with the cameras . In animated movies there are also a lot of Painters and Animators involved . Making a movie takes a lot of different people with different professions and puts them together in a Team which will ( maybe ) produce a masterpiece . I think this is what makes movies so great . I do n't really have a opinion in what medium is the superficial medium but I still think my opinion will be useful for the discussion . ( sorry for possible mistakes , not my native language )

1 [ Fight Smack in the Orphange ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=3P63Uyrfsb4 )

1 The film breaks me into more parts than I knew I had . Sobbing , tear-stained parts . I was , however , watching it with a close friend who I have sexy times with and we did so very shortly after . ( Not in celebration of my crying , of course . ) TUL : Never be embarrassed to be you . Being emotionally available ai n't just for women , children and certain types of fish that do so purely because their genes . It is n't weak to break yourself open and display your insides . It is weak to pretend you do n't have any to begin with .

1 ... .I do n't know if I 'm blind and ca n't see the link for the livestream channel anywhere , or if there is n't one .

1 There 's not actually that much action from Spider-Man . The small battle at the beginning , the Electro battle , then the final Electro / Green Goblin battle .

1 This is one of those moments where I have to remind myself that everyone is entitled to their own opinion .

1 > I believe Diesel created Riddick and the universe it all takes place in . This is not the case.. It was Twohy 's labor of love . He spent years building a universe for the story to take place in . Chronicles of riddick was actually to be the start of a much larger trilogy . Twohy had hoped that the spectacle of the movie would lead to building a franchise . It however did not rake i the dough like they hoped . The studio decided to not greenlight any sequels at the time , and the story was buried ( I guess until now ) the thing is , Twohy i really great with the thriller genre , I just feel that his sense of spectacle is best confined to the written word instead of directing . Chronicles was a jumble , and felt like it was trying so hard to show you the universe it 's in , that it forgot to be a movie .

1 > My problem is that , as a reboot , I felt like they could have knocked it up to college or something , and school and classes could still be used as plot devices . Going to disagree - outside of the first 30 minutes of the original Spider-Man movies , the entire series takes place in and around college . The high schpool angle is a fresh take ( and relates more to the Ultimate universe which the movie is more based off of ) .

1 Agreed . It was either Helena Bonham Carter or Cate Blanchett . I wenf with Cate , but Ms . Bonham is amazing .

1 Hey , man , economy hit us all pretty hard .

1 Questions like this are the same kind of panicky bullshit that media outlets pull . NOTHING will happen with the future of movies . A bunch of groups that want money and exposure will rant and rave , and some politicians will use it as as fuel for their campaigns , but in the end nothing will change . The quicker everyone shuts the fuck up and goes back to their lives and realizes that we ca n't predict or control every single event , the happier we all will be .

1 `` ... but no third movie was made ? ''

1 Everyday we were told that as soon as the public knows we 're in the area the pranks wo n't work and we 'd have to pull the plug . Had to squash rumors as soon as they popped up .

1 does this count ?

1 They were n't remakes , they were adaptations of the same source material . Which begs the question as to whether or not the Jackson LotR films can actually be remade , instead of just being re-adaptations .

1 I dunno , the white guy just looked WTF

1 It 's not a poster , it 's a jigsaw , as mentioned [ above ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / 1ov96c / new_poster_for_the_hobbit_the_desolation_of_smaug / ccw97l8 ) : )

1 The movie was a direct influence on that episode . Not a true replacement , but a decent send-up to ~~the original~~ John Carpenter 's version .

1 Even in the musical , I believe Gavroche has the same accent . So I do n't think it 's something new to the movie .

1 Mysterio- a Spider-Man villain Or maybe you mean the right of Cable- he 's Puck from Alpha Flight

1 It 's a musical .

1 ca n't speak specifically regarding film , but i read a lot of amateur writing . one of the biggest issues you find is that , because writers already know the story in full , some of them when editing will completely miss parts where they have n't communicated their ideas very well . i do n't think that 's exclusive to amateurs either , like i think f. scott fitzgerald was supposed to be god-awful pre-editing . anyway , i assume schoonmaker is / was avoiding a similar issue . i mean , maybe it hindered her work , maybe it did n't . who knows . with that said , it 's not like her approach is inherently uncollaborative . you could just do a first few naive edits , and then work with the script / director from there on . she also did have the benefit that she could trust scorsese not to pick a terrible script ; most of us would n't have the same luxury .

1 Yeah we do . This is a sub dedicated to movies . These are relevant images for a movie we 're interested in .

1 Hardy 's delivery completely sold me on that dialogue exchange . I liked pretty much all of Bane 's lines in that movie .

1 The founding fathers did great things and awful things , which can make them difficult to evaluate as men . You can admire them for their accomplishments or condemn them for their failings , but to ignore one in order to define them solely by the other is n't right . That 's what American Sniper does . Everything I said about Chris Kyle is in the public record , along with , arguably , worse . He was a bigot and a bullshit artist . We * could * recognize that his attitude towards middle easterners was based on experience if there were n't a record of his attitude being borne of religious enmity . He saw himself as a crusader and the war as a Crusade , in the literal sense , and said he wanted to kill anybody he saw with a Koran . He made up a bunch of stories to feed his celebrity , and the fact that he thought it was good for his image to claim he was still killing people after he came home says a lot about what a fucked up guy he was . Kyle tarnished the image of a man who served his country as a SEAL in a far less popular war so he could look like a bigger man . He was , by all accounts , an exceptional soldier , but that does n't excuse his racism or what he did after his career was over . It 's true that no one has , as yet , made a movie about me , which is about as relevant to this topic as the lack of a film of your life story is , which is not at all .

1 Strongly disagree . I was in a fast food place a block from a high school last year and heard some 15-16 year olds quoting billy madison . It 's like porky 's and animal house and the jerk . They may not be the greatest films of all time but future generations will still go back and watch them . I know growing up with comedy central on TV I saw a lot of older classic comedies like Porky 's I otherwise would n't have if it was n't on while I was bored . Some of Sandler 's more recent garbage ( see : jack & jill , or more aptly , do n't ) wo n't be remembered but some of his old stuff will last a long time , whether you think that 's good or not .

1 Nope . Incredible Hulk is the one they use as the canon , its included in the Phase 1 box set , and events from it are referenced in the first Avengers movie . Norton was recast and the Hulk was redesigned for the Avengers , but canonically it is the same character and follows the events of Incredible Hulk . EDIT : Also nope , nothing in the reddiquette about not downvoting blatantly false info . Sorry dude but you 're 0 for 2 here .

1 Watched that today . It 's a good movie , very faithful to the book other than a few minor things . I was happy with it .

1 The whole thing looks like it was sculpted by taiwanese child labor that had never seen the movie and used a hong-kong black market `` revenge of the jedi '' poster as the only reference .

1 It 's the same look as I get after the DMV .

1 But your criticism is equally true for reading the book today .

1 Yea , like I said , I read the leaked original script that was posted on here a while back , and it was infinitely better . I think you can really see all the rewrites . And I 'm not saying it 's David Lindelof 's fault , but I 'm saying LOST was awful and the next Prometheus movie will be better off without him .

1 The three laws are originaly from the cannon , however now they are core of roboethics in both imaginary worlds and the real one . There 's nothing weird with using them ? everyone does . Also , you can hardly call a ( loose ) movie adaptation of a book ripoff .

1 Holy shit yahoo slideshows are useless on mobile .

1 Then you missed the point . There is a difference between what you do and who you are . Mike wanted to be the best scarer ( what he would do ) but he was n't scary ( who he was ) . He was still able to work at MI , but not as a scarer . Because he was using what made him unique to his advantage . He worked as a trainer for Sulley and pushed him to be the best scarer MI had ever seen . That was the point of the cabin / police scene . Mike could scare ( what he would do ) , but he needed the natural ability of who Sulley was to accomplish it .

1 `` bad guys '' is a technical term meaning characters with pimples , scars , russian accents , and fetishes .

1 man that scene fucked me up ( maybe because my parents thought Gremlins was an appropriate movie for a 7 year old )

1 Same . It 's sooooo good in 3D .

1 He needs to watch his son go through involuntary electro-shock therapy .

1 Park Chan-Wook , who directed The Vengeance Trilogy and one of the Three Extremes , also directed a vampire movie called Thirst which is pretty good .

1 A Drew McWeeny review is listening to him tell you about his childhood home in Texas . With Interstellar he changed it to Florida .

1 Yea , it really has n't been done . I mean there are some out there , but none of them are Saving Private Ryan , Band of Brothers ( not a movie i know ) or Schindler 's List ( or many more good WW2 movies ) . I would love to see this happen

1 short and to the point . good comment

1 Thank you based Tina and Amy .

1 actually , he 's one of my most favorite actors and this is one of my most favorite movies . simply wanted to share in memory , people tend to do that . not all redditors care about karma grabs ( says the one who has 17,450 comment karmas )

1 All of them do . It 's mandated by federal law. Most movies get around it though the use of the `` Oh Yeah Break '' Loophole . Though the law requires every movie include at least seven seconds of `` Oh Yeah '' , it does n't specify which seven seconds . So , in 1986 , a savvy producer just spliced together all the dead space in the song to create well over seven seconds of silence that technically fulfills the legal requirement . Most modern movies use this seven seconds . One notable exception is the movie Inception , which instead simply slowed down and distorted a `` bow '' in the `` bow bow '' and played it repeatedly throughout the movie until they were well above the seven second minimum .

1 We love Will Smith but fuck his son is weird

1 I watched it on a Friday night . I was wrecked for the remainder of that weekend . So good but I can never watch it again .

1 What a lovely , lovely voice .

1 Thats Called a Marine .

1 It says , `` En garde ! ''

1 Cinema is incredibly personal . What works for some does not work for others . No great art is universally adored , because good art does not pander . The only thing you are missing the fact that you can never be wrong for not liking a movie or director .

1 This . The Prequels are terrible but I 'm glad they exist because otherwise we would n't have those hilarious reviews .

1 To be fair , nearly any reason for not liking transformers is valid .

1 So that 's what a bomb is , now ? A * not * utterly fantastic movie that * some * people were disappointed with ? It 's not even some universally agreed on opinion . I thought it was fantastic , and that Copely was pretty damn intimidating in it .

1 A shame I have never seen someone parody this . The Scene : Someone pumps a shotgun 8 times trying to threaten a bunch of hostages in a bank or somethings , trying to be a badass or something and then he finally shoots someone , but nothing comes out . And he 's just like : `` Holy fuck , is this thing jammed ? `` , and someone is just like `` No , you pumped all of your ammo out trying to look like a badass , only to look like a dumbass , you fucking dumbass . ''

1 It 's kind of shoved down your throat too much ( with your point in mind , unnecessarily ) for it not to be some sort of symbolism .

1 I do n't know , Hawkeye and Blackwidow are great shots and very athletic , Captain America 's strong , but guided missiles , super-strength , pretty much indestructible armor , flying , I mean to me it sounds like 4 Iron-Men would just be immensely more powerful than the other way around .

1 I watched the second one yesterday for like the fifth time

1 Well * excuse me * Mr * Gives A Fuck * .

1 Reminds me of I Robot ... that 's a bad thing .

1 No , I 'm saying 16 screens is large and I still do n't always have the option to watch a movie in 2D . I 'm from a small one screen town originally so I know what it 's like to live with a small theatre .

1 I liked it . I laughed more than anything . Clint Eastwoods unrelenting barrage of rascist slurs was hilariously awesome . His tone was unapologetic , and yet the words lacked any real hatred or bitterness . That 's really the only thing that stuck with me from that movie , the offhand , straight faced rascist slurs . Never seen a film make a racist protagonist as respectable as gran tarino did . I hope I do n't come off as a nazi or something in th is post . I 'm not a rascist nor do I like rascism . But this movie shed some light into the world of the past where rascism was common place , and showed an interesting juxtaposition between the old mans time and the modern world .

1 I think it 's hit or miss- if you do n't find Johnny Depp 's character funny , I can see how the scenes would be unbearable . Personally I found them consistently hilarious , but it 's definitely a very 'off ' style of humor that a lot of people hate . And I agree that it was n't scary in the slightest . It did n't try to be- the villain was so absurd .

1 Oh * Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeesus * ! !

1 Godfather is amazing , the first time you see it there 's so much hype that you do n't expect it to live up and then it just exceeds so wildly . That would have to be close to , if not , a perfect film

1 And a soundtrack by Mastodon .

1 Someone asked Greg Sestero ( Mark ) this in the AMAs he did . IIRC he replied with something along the lines of `` Tommy said that 's the twist ''

1 I love how that exact scene was in TDKR .

1 Pretty sure you can sync up Army of Darkness with Metallica 's Kill 'Em All .

1 Should 've gone more for the [ spoiler ] ( / s `` little-kid-getting-bullied angle ? '' )

1 Zac Efron dude .

1 Agreed , that was a very specific moment when the two non-humans communicated , and was left very unexplained . Unless , of course , it was as simple as describing what was about to happen , `` let 's escape , kill him if that 's necessary ''

1 I would wholeheartedly agree . It 's a brilliant film , but a difficult watch purely from the point of view of what it deals with . Wonderfully acted , though .

1 Fly , you fools .

1 Yeah Training Day is definitely Fuqua 's best . Love both the characters in this film . Hawks was actually pretty good .

1 Password keys ? Do you mean the authenticator ? I 'd so they only way you could get hacked with one was a man in the middle virus . Nasty stuff and it 's a problem for a lot of games . If you got hacked with an authenticator in your account you may have bigger problems then the game stuff . I 'm serious , check your computer out super thoroughly . As for the no help part though , that was not my experience when I was hacked ( no auth at the time ) . They got all my stuff back with in a week . Which I 'm sure only took that long because of the shear amount of tickets they must get daily with so many subscribers . There call center must be nuts .

1 So someone down-voted this . I see no reason to , you 're only expressing your enjoyment . Have an upvote !

1 Which comic is he referring to exactly ? Dark Knight Returns - Batman gets back into the game after a decade long retirement after losing someone close to him ( love interest in the film , boy wonder in the comics ) . Knightfall - Bane pushes batman to his emotional and physical limit after finally breaking his back . He is a superior fighter to Batman with genius level intellect . They just changed `` venom '' to painkillers for realism in the movie . John Blake is a stand in for Robin analogous to Tim Drake ( the third Robin , now Red Robin ) an orphan who was able to figure out Batman and Nightwing 's identities at the age of 9 . Someone has already mentioned that Catwoman is more like Miller / Loeb 's `` Year One '' / `` The Long Halloween '' version . Where she also takes care of another , younger female . No Man 's Land - After a disaster , the U.S. Govt evacuates and abandons Gotham City . It 's an earthquake in the comic , but a bomb in the movie . Feat of Clay ( The Animated Series ) - Daggett hires Bane and Selina Kyle to force Wayne Enterprises into bankruptcy . Sound familiar ? Your brother should do a little more research and a little less complaining .

1 Or British names as they 're also known .

1 Well as someone else pointed out , the cast have all aged ( Nathan Fillion and Adam Baldwin the most noticeably ) . So unless you 're OK with someone else playing those roles I think a prequel is dead in space .

1 Harrison Ford better get fat as hell like Graff does by the end of the book .

1 In hindsight , it 's clear as day . But at that moment , it would never occur to anybody that the movie was going to be so meta .

1 Also one of them tripped carrying the USB stick up the stairs and broke his neck . Just really unfortunate .

1 Yes , The Road is a great movie , even better if you 've read the book .

1 `` guy tries ta kill ya and ya want his job ... '' good point haha

1 I think he refers to Brave , which played out exactly like a Dreamworks movie ... And Dreamworksification does n't mean it 's shit , it 's just a different style . Dreamworks : Visual gags and focus on humor . Pixar : Unique settings and stories with a lot of heart . Take a look at Brave , Cars 2 and Monsters University , they look very much like Dreamworks movies . And even weirder , How to Train Your Dragon felt more like a Pixar movie .

1 He 's speaking from the perspective of the actor . Of course the people behind the camera love digital , because of the reasons you stated . But for an actor on film , it is the one and only time in the entire movie making process that everything is completely dependent on their performance . That fear of screwing up , and costing the production budget several hundred dollars on useless footage is damn well sure to make you want to perform your best .

1 Will Furelle and Kristen Wyge !

1 One of my favorite scenes is when one of the guys wakes up with his hands duct taped to the steering wheel and Creasy simply says `` I 'm going to ask you a question . If I do n't like the answer I 'm going to cut one of your fingers off '' . The guy just responds with a `` fuck you '' and without hesitation Creasy proceeds to cut his finger off and cauterize the wound with the cigar lighter . That scene was so intense because it was just so matter of fact . Like , there was no reasoning with Creasy . He knew what he set out to do and was going through with it with absolutely no hesitation .

1 And another mis-guided band of their employees seek the advice of Motherfucker Jones again ... ..

1 Do you mean the animated movie Coraline ? If there 's a movie called Caroline in there then my mistake but I checked and Coraline is in there and it 's really , really charming . Full of vivid imagery & colours , it 's just downright fun ! It 's based on a book by Neil Gaiman which is equally charming . If you 're into nightmare before christmas , it 's the same director sans Tim Burton 's influence . Definitely worth a watch if that was up your alley and another of Gaiman 's books are being adapted by Selick which I 'm really looking forward to . : D

1 It can make a bad movie bearable though .

1 Really really good , but got to say , found it hard to actually hear some of the lines at the start .

1 He was very good in Showtime 's tv series Brotherhood .

1 Holy shit , someone needs to get laid .

1 Not to mention movie goers are just gon na see Darkseid as a Thanos knockoff even if Darkseid did come first in the Comics does n't matter it will just look like DC is copying Marvel .

1 Good think he is also the director and has a say in how that will play out .

1 That movie should have been called 1 angry man , 1 skeptical man and 10 indifferent men .

1 You can look up an actual explanation of the storyline , that was left out for some reason . All they really explain in the film is that there are bigger ones and smaller ones . The actual plot for the predators was supposed to be that by law , the predators are only supposed to hunt at certain times . Kind of like a hunting season . The planet in the movie was set up as a `` poaching reserve '' . The predator that they found tied up was basically the predator version of a cop , that was sent to investigate the reserve , and the other predators were the poachers . I 'll see if I can find a link to this , but IIRC , this was what Rodriguez intended for the predator back story .

1 If it goes against the lore it makes sense . It 'd be like if in the next Harry Potter book , it turns out Voldemort is actually Harry 's lover all along . Given the entire premise it doesnt make sense , even if Voldemort does n't actually exist .

1 Just by being nominated for Best Picture it 'll bring in good DVD and Bluray sales as well .

1 Not any more . The beard is gone .

1 I admit , I do as well , he 's never made a movie I did n't like . Even Clooney thought so saying after * Three Kings * : > `` Will I work with David ever again ? Absolutely not . Never . Do I think he 's tremendously talented and do I think he should be nominated for Oscars ? Yeah . '' `` ( From Wikipedia )

1 Most if not all screeners have watermarks .

1 They should 've got him back for season 2 .

1 The way I saw it is that he did n't quite understand what all was happening until he saw the 4x4 . At that point he started to realize that this was his new life now . His parents were doing great , his siblings were doing great , and now he was doing great too . It just took him until the 4x4 to put it all together .

1 The point of that was to 'capture ' the feel of the roaring 20 's . If they put jazz from the 20 's into the film todays audience would n't be able to get the proper feel , so they are putting in 'hard ' hip-hop and grindy rock to get the same kind of feeling , something that 's still a bit risque in todays society for instance . Just think about it for a bit and it makes sense . Source : Someone talking about this exact thing on NPR .

1 Yikes , better hop in your time machine .

1 I could say it 's become more popular since X2 , when Mystique allowed herself to be captured while posing as Wolverine . Or maybe it 's been more popular since Seven , when Kevin Spacey 's character 's final 2 sins hinge on his being caught . Etc , etc , etc . I 've heard people give Nolan movies credit for everything from inventing film tropes to inventing darkness and it is fucking exhausting . Nolanites are ruining otherwise decent films with their obsession .

1 All that was thrown out the window when Nero created a new timeline . That utopian ideal is now threatened . For these 'rebooted ' films to have real lasting impact , they have to make that connection and tie it back to our own time , to make it relevant to * now * . Part of me was hoping that old Spock would stay in the picture as an adviser to Starfleet , helping them to move back to where things * should * have been - and by extension , hinting at what we need to be wary of if we ever want to reach that utopia ourselves . Spock 's commentary on how things were better in his own timeline would provide a useful perspective on how the current Federation government is letting things spiral out of control . If this is to be more than just a confrontation between a havoc-bent villain and the stalwart crew of the best ship in the fleet , then it has to have repercussions beyond the mere physical destruction . There ought to be ongoing arguments between Kirk and ( young ) Spock about the measures Starfleet is willing to take to fight this threat and how to balance those while maintaining the paradise of liberty and equality Earth has fought so hard to build . If it 's just an action romp without an overarching theme of the many shades of tyranny , then it 'll be a massively wasted opportunity to use sci-fi as a powerful vehicle for socially-relevant commentary - like Gene Roddenberry originally envisioned when he created * Star Trek * .

1 The movie has nothing at all to do with the reasons for going into Iraq . To the extent it does justify the war through characters such as the Butcher , that is based on fact . As for not portraying a complete Chris Kyle , this is common and even expected . I 'd expect there is a harder time coming up with 'complete ' biopics versus dramatic portrayals on a limited aspect of a real life person , such as Amadeus or A Beautiful Mind .

1 Yep , Dave Grohl was born there , Dominic Sena ( director of the Gone In 60 Seconds reboot , Swordfish , and some other Nic Cage movies ) is from nearby Niles , a whole slew of football players are from Warren as well .

1 It 's not really supposed to have action . That 's sort of the point .

1 > X-Men Apocalypse focuses on Jennifer Lawrence and Jennifer Lawrence 's Love Interest ftfy

1 [ ] you did read the book actually , there 's a version of the movie ( and lynch had his name removed from it ! ) that explains the lack of computers : > The * Butlerian Jihad * is an event in the back-story of Frank Herbert 's fictional Dune universe . Occurring over 10,000 years before the events chronicled in his 1965 novel Dune , this jihad leads to the outlawing of certain technologies , primarily `` thinking machines '' , a collective term for computers and artificial intelligence of any kind . This prohibition is a key influence on the nature of Herbert 's fictional setting .

1 Bigger the circle gets , the more time someone is watching that one point .

1 Tetsuo the Iron Man . . .sweet chrimbus . . .

1 It 's not . Seriously , he was awesome in that movie . The movie itself is divisive ( I liked it ) , but his performance was chilling .

1 Meh . Whatever . I do n't really care who voices ultron . I care that I have to watch the avengers fight a robot . I 'm trying to get excited for this but I 'm having a hard time .

1 Except the Joker has green hair . I guess this guy was really crazy .

1 Dumb and Dumber .

1 But he made Ed Wood and Big Fish . I know that hating on Burton is easy because of the crap movies he made but Nolan is 12 years younger than Burton . Twelve years ago , Burton was still a good director and in 1999 he released Sleepy Hollow , a great movie . Let 's wait and see .

1 I think people think it is too gimmicky and comical , which I ca n't necessarily argue .

1 The movie keeps stressing how Royal thinks his relationship with his adopted daughter , Margot , is fine , while she resents him for making her feel like she was n't a real daughter . This shot is basically contrasting their relationship with the other fathers / daughters . Wes Anderson FTW

1 > And I do n't recall for sure , but I believe in Skyfall they reference Bond 's parents and they 're both explicitly named Bond too . What I think he 's saying is since Craigs Bond is a reboot he 'd be the first `` Bond '' . Then after he dies they pass the name on . Ignoring the previous movies of course .

1 For a fair bit of it , she 's standing still but he also has his back to her until she first hits him , at which point he 's on the defensive the whole time . If you watch closely you can usually see where she is by splashes or shadows-you can see she 's moving very little when she is n't actively hitting / grabbing / twisting him . You can also see the occasional shimmer , [ as it is n't at all perfect invisibility . ] ( http : / ghostintheshell.wikia.com / wiki / Thermoptic_camouflage ) Even if he realizes where she is ( around :46 it looks like he knows she 's directly in front of him ) , he ca n't really know what she 's doing with her arms . She 's also much stronger than she is , as her synthetic body is absolute top of the line military tech versus whatever he might have ( which might not even be a completely synthetic body , I ca n't remember ) . He was weaker , panicked , and might not have ever had to deal with an invisible foe . That fight was only going to go one way .

1 Only 5 minutes ? On Reddit ? ? Bravo !

1 No , I mean this movie . It 's wildly inaccurate , because it is mostly based not on Genesis , but the non-canonical book of Eunoch , and the director wants to push his ideas , making major changes . Plus , it 's a movie , which needs a certain structure and mass appeal , causing more changes . Based on this trailer and the other info we 're given , no one will expect a faithful adaption . I would like to see one made someday , but I doubt that 'll happen .

1 No , the anonymous crew can not come forward without being vulnerable to physical attack . But the nomination led the government to finally speak about the film . They acknowledged the 1965 genocide is a crime against humanity , which is an aboutface . Until now , they 've maintained the killings were heroic . - JO

1 Except : * Blizzard 's writing is n't very good , at least not on its own . Duncan Jones , however , is a great writer and director . This is mostly judged from Moon . He is the one who set the WarCraft film 's story straight , whereas the idea used to be to have a film from the Alliance perspective , from a single human hero who we 've never met before , taking place between Frozen Throne and World of Warcraft , about some conflict between the Alliance and Horde that would obviously have little impact on anything because we never heard of them before , with the mindset to have it similar to 300 because 300 was a recent film by Legendary that was trending and they thought it would be cool to see a WarCraft version . Keep in mind that Blizzard has a history of making games based on things that they thought were cool . Warhammer heavily inspired the production of WarCraft , World of Warcraft was made because everyone was really into EverQuest ( they even cancelled the game they were currently working on to start WoW ) , and recently people have been into CCGs and that led to Hearthstone . With that said , obviously those all led to success . * We will be seeing great CGI in this even though it will be mostly live action with great makeup / costuming . It will be the visual effects team that worked on Life of Pi . * Each Blizzard cinematic takes roughly a year to complete . Keep in mind that they also do not use motion capture . All animation is done manually , and realism is much more difficult to achieve this way of course . * Blizzard 's cinematic department is very small . This is also why the hand animation is so much slower , however , the few people who work on it are very , very skilled . This differs from animation companies such as Disney and Dreamworks who have literally hundreds of animators for each of their films . Exaggerated animation is also quite a bit more forgiving as it does n't really venture into the uncanny valley . If it 's unclear , I absolutely love Blizzard 's cinematics too , but full length films are not exactly their territory .

1 I still want the Slip n ' Slide movie to happen

1 Cool .

1 Made from scratch . So impressive .

1 I do n't see how she was un necessary because she facilitated a large plot device for the entire middle of the movie .

1 [ Whew . ] ( http : / popwatch.ew.com / 2010 / 04 / 09 / rob-pattinson-kurt-cobain-biopic / )

1 I 'm not a big believer in snappy quotable dialog = automatic great screenplay . A complete screenplay needs to have something more . Not necessarily originality , just something that gets the audience more involved on an unconscious level . Great writing invests in character development more than anything else . A Separation Secrets & Lies Naked The Lives of Others Two of these are written by Mike Leigh , one of the great scribes of our time .

1 May I ask , which line is it from the trailer that bothers you the most ?

1 Oh , you must have only seen Shanghai Noon and all the movies that came after .

1 You have the right sub , but not the right thread . There are times and places to provide your opinion of TMNT . Now is not one of them .

1 Of all the * Fuck you * moments in movie history , it may very well be the Fuck you-iest .

1 While we 're on Pitt , his delivery of `` I thought you might be worried about the security ... of your shit '' was amazing in Burn After Reading .

1 Dude , the movie will probably end with Hulk punching a server in another country or something ... causing all the Ultron clones to die immediately . Crisis averted !

1 First IRL laugh from internet browsing of the day !

1 They hate us , cause they ai n't us ! The movie was fantastic , you suck OP

1 Not enough veins ... .

1 > It 's a Unix system.. I know this . Every hacker in every movie ever

1 That looked pretty professional . I like the segments of dialogue in the movie . Still , I do n't really know what it 's about . A little bit more information would be great , I feel like I love the pictures and not the story .

1 There 's some justification for having more ads aimed at women , because the social rules for hat wearing were different for men and women . Men could leave hats on outdoors , at athletic events ( indoors or outdoors ) , on public transit , in some public buildings ( post offices , hotels , office lobbies ) , and in elevators . Men were supposed to take hats off in homes , when eating at a table , when being introduced , in a church , indoors at work , in some public buildings ( schools , libraries , courthouses , town halls ) , in restaurants , at indoor performances ( movies , plays , concerts ) , when the national anthem is played , and when the flag passes by such as in a parade . Women , on the other hand , could leave hats on in homes , in church , at restaurants , at indoor performances ( but see below ) , during the national anthem , and when the flag passes by . Women were supposed to take hats off indoors at work , and when it blocks someone 's view . So , at a movie , you 'd expect men to remove their hats without reminding because men generally remove their hats indoors . There were only a small set of exceptions . Women , on the other hand , generally kept hats on indoors , and so it seems reasonable that they might need a reminder that this is one of the few situations where they * might * need to remove a hat indoors .

1 Trent Reznor 's got a lot of nerve to rip off Lebron James .

1 `` What are you telling me , that I can dodge bullets ? '' `` No Neo , I trying to tell you that when you 're ready , you wo n't have to . ''

1 The thread is * worst * movie you have * sat through * , not greatest films of all time .

1 My friend got me the trilogy box set for my birthday a few years back . E knew how much I loved them . Definitely one you can watch over and over

1 Would n't be the first time . I 'm not sure about the rest of the world , but I know the UK did n't get the shawarma scene at the end of The Avengers . Also did n't get the commentary on the DVD .

1 No thank you . But feel free to downvote the comment so it gets hidden for others . Negative karma is worth showing the usefulness of Karma Decay .

1 `` No ticket ! ''

1 I think the distraction and confusion was part of the point in Waking Life .

1 I do n't know , maybe because she is a talented actress . ( she 's also gorgeous )

1 His acting in ROTS was really good whenever he did n't have to spew out awful dialogue . People latch on to the content of awful lines that he 's not responsible for having to say while ignoring how well he portrayed Anakin 's emotional arc in all the other ways that make for a good performance ( body language , facial expressions , tone of voice etc )

1 Seu Jorge plays guitar Pirates have stolen our ship Did we get the shot ?

1 It 's far from perfect , and the ending pissed off my friends when we saw it the first time , but I think it 's vintage Gilliam . It may not be as good as Brazil , but it 's a solid 8 / 10 .

1 I just got chills reading this article ! This will be an epic movie worth seeing in the theaters .

1 I did n't want to list all his movies because it 's honestly been awhile since I 've seen some of them . That and The Prestige might just be my favorite Nolan movie , so it 's probably better that I leave that one out ; )

1 Upvote for liking the wosrt movies ever made

1 My age is showing but back in the day , you would stop off at a video store with your friends and chat ; sometimes you 'd chat with one of the guys there , and without expecting ad clicks or page views , you would BS about movies . Blogs appeared and anyone could form and publish an opinion on any subject including movies . It 's not bad just different . We were amateurs but we loved movies , obscure , weird , and maybe even cool . Of course , as one of the comments mentioned , this forum is what we have now . I think this works in a fashion that I would have never dreamed of . Millions of people could potentially comment on a movie , with important comments being pushed to the top through the democratization of ideas .

1 It 's pretty low budget , and does n't really hold up against the other two , but definitely worth a watch .

1 Haha , if onl ... I mean yes .

1 It was poorly written as well .

1 Because it 's beautiful .

1 The Rock is one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood . I sincerely doubt that he is jealous .

1 Only 15 bucks for all three ? That 's a pretty good deal . Also ... FUCK YOU , I wish I could go .

1 Peter Stormare is the best part of every movie . I want to have my vocal cords replaced with Peter Stormare .

1 Spoilers , dude .

1 Because the non-soldier personality does n't have control over the weapons . And the soldier personality would n't care about civilian casualties and would just evade it . He chose to be human .

1 Like Thrift Shop ?

1 Same here . I would have been excited for the movie if they simply said , `` this happened and now she has these powers because of it '' , not `` this happened and it gave her full use of her brain instead of 10 % and she has these powers because of it . ''

1 Outbreak 2 : Outbreakier

1 forgot to mind her surroundings

1 Jurrasic park

1 Brokeback Mountain

1 My first thought as well and I am relieved that it is the prevailing comment . That suit is iconic .

1 this one is only fun to look for during the first 2 seasons . then they got lazy and just put superman on jerrys shelf

1 There 's a 2D version , too .

1 From the context , it 's obvious he meant `` how much [ scenery ] in movies is just green screen . '' Chill the fuck out .

1 > old movie

1 Jesus Christ , you 're not grown up yet ?

1 Chill out guy . Still loved it .

1 Let 's keep the conversation centered around Rampart , okay / u / Defengar ?

1 * Dazed and Confused * Boogie Nights * Almost Famous * Goodfellas * Casino * American Hustle * Pulp Fiction * Rushmore

1 1 hour and 6 minutes apprx .

1 * Captain Jack Sparrow

1 * farts *

1 Blair Witch , IMO . The ending still haunts me .

1 Technically not the opening scene , though , unless you actually mean old man Ryan in the graveyard .

1 I may be wrong , but I feel like * Synecdoche , New York * is pretty unknown , or at least not as known as it should be . Wonderful film written and directed by Charlie Kaufman ( who wrote * Eternal Sunshine * , * Adaptation . * and * Being John Malkovich * ) and starring Phillip Seymour Hoffman in my second favorite role of his . A near-perfect piece about existentialism , fear of death , and the struggle to reflect life within art .

1 Dredd , He fought the Death Judges and won , Plissken while still being badass , took on Bruce Campbell and won Clear Winner here , and it 's Dredd

1 Huh ? I was n't judging them . I was saying that none of those deaths were particularly surprising . People knew Robin Williams was sick and dying long before he killed himself . Paul Walker was known for doing risky things , so it 's not exactly shocking that one of his risks came back to hit him . Philip Seymour Hoffman had been struggling with heroin addiction for a long time . And Attenborough was 90 YEARS OLD . How much longer were we expecting him to hang around ? I think PSH gave one of the best performances in film history in The Master . Robin Williams was my favorite movie star of all time- I can quote Jumanji and Hook word for word , for god 's sake . I have absolutely nothing against these people . But that does n't suddenly make them immortal .

1 Jackass is said multiple times in pretty much every episode .

1 Instead of [ this ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=6zwhFwuPk7I ) he 'd have ended up with [ this ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=w1dbrHPIrwA ) .

1 it does bring a LOT of laughs . Its so corny . Born from the `` dangers of D & D '' hysteria of the time . So lame that it is fantastic .

1 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ?

1 and mel brooks had the advantage of actually being jewish

1 Hugo ? It 's an awesome film .

1 No movie `` needs ' a remake or sequel . But they 're made anyways . Let 's not forget Christian Bale is nowhere near the first iteration of a Batman movie . If they stopped with Keaton imagine what 'd we be missing out on now . Look at James Bond . At first no one thought anyone but Sean Connery could play 007 . If Hollywood listened to those fans Roger Moore , Timothy Dalton , Pierce Brosnan , and Daniel Craig all would never have created the incredible films that they have . It 's similar to remakes . A remake of a film is n't going to ruin or tarnish anyone 's love for the original . It does n't affect your views of the film in any way . If you do n't like the remake do n't watch it . The Thing From another World did n't NEED to be remade . It was regarded as a good film , but it was remade anyways , into The Thing , which is now regarded as a Scifi-Horror classic . Evil Dead did n't NEED to be remade but it was . And the remakes seen as a pretty good horror film . Superman The Movie did n't NEED to be remade , but then we would n't have Man of Steel which many people love . Scarface was a remake , Cape Fear was a remake , Dawn of the Dead was a remake , Dracula , 3:10 to Yuma , True Grit , ect . ( The Departed , A Fist Full of Dollars , Unforgiven , ect are films that are also remakes , but of foreign language films ) Remakes / Reboots are n't a bad thing . It 's just another chance / opportunity to create a new fresh take on a popular character by a different artist . If everyone stopped making remakes / reboots once they felt satisfied we as viewers would be missing out on some of the greatest films in cinema history .

1 This is a really great choice , especially since WWI kicked up in the Balkans .

1 If ? If ? ? ? It 's already been a profitable series , it ties in to an even more profitable series , and there 's just no way this movie wo n't turn a profit . The merchandising alone is lucrative , and it 'll make back it 's money in the foreign markets alone , let alone the US . You clearly do n't know what you 're talking about and obviously just want to argue in the face of all the facts . Hype alone will give this a guaranteed more-than-acceptable opening weekend .

1 Hell yeah , Asylum is the best .

1 As shitty and jarring as those shots were , they are n't CGI .

1 They do a lot of analysis before the film is even released , and have gotten very good at predicting success and failure .

1 Tunisia

1 If you enjoy it quietly , I wo n't judge you . However , if you proclaim it to be academy award-winning , only then while you be judged .

1 Why did you watch it four times ? For me it was the sheer bloody mindedness of the two antagonists , how they just hated each other for no real reason and it all came out in the last scene . I need to watch it again really : )

1 Nah I thought it was exactly what he deserved . He never really was anything more than a pawn in the Game , and he died like a pawn too .

1 It is garbage , but its easy garbage . It has all of the posturing and synthetic quirk that makes its dull audience believe it 's something real . It 's a 'fresh ' romantic comedy for those with no real interest in cinema . I will read that article when I have more time ( at work : )

1 I can understand most of the disappointment towards the sequels , the first movie uniquely blew everyone 's mind and when the sequels failed to garner universal acclaim they suddenly became terrible films . The Matrix ended on a 10 and sure the Wachowski ? s were n't up to maintaining that , but I do n't think the sequels deserve anywhere close to the hatred they constantly receive .

1 That movie sucks dick , and that dicks name is Sam Witwicky .

1 Did he say it wasnt ?

1 We walked out and snuck in to fighter . Best decision ever made .

1 What app are you using ! Reddit is fun can save just for future reference

1 I really thought he should have won for A Single Man , and I definitely agree with him not deserving Best Actor for The King 's Speech . I think Social Network should have won Best Picture too .

1 Exactly . Terminator 2 takes place in 1995 and judging by the age of Sarah , John and John 's kid , this would depict the future somewhere around , oh 2015-2025. edit : whoops , 2029 , as someone else in this thread already pointed out .

1 The guy next to him is a focus puller , he most likely has a device connected to the camera to change focus and zoom at a predefined set rate that they practiced . This is what is normally done on complex shots . Sometimes camera rigs ( dollies included ) can require 5-6 hands on the rig just to get a single shot . Awesome stuff .

1 I 'm pretty sure he has a new documentary he 's about to release . The Napster documentary was excellent , by the way .

1 Except Rose . She dies of being a selfish bitch who does n't share space on floating pieces of wood . At a very young age . * ... in an ideal world *

1 STUNT COCK ! ! !

1 Do n't forget Spartacus

1 The effects artists left several shots unfinished . Literally . They ran out of time and did not finish the shots . They 're 'good enough ' to go up against a lot of the other poor SFX work I guess..

1 The studio abandoned it before it was released . It never really had a shot at the box office .

1 It was added to Netflix instant a few days ago . If you have netflix you should definitely check it out .

1 I love the ending where Marge and her husband are all cozy in bed . The ending makes me feel like `` I should be happy for Marge , but this is pretty much just another day for her . '' She seemed so unaffected by seeing a man put through a wood chipper .

How else would you explain me not getting a college scholarship when I know a black person who did ? Now I have to pay loans , so insulting to me ...

1 Supposedly , he did n't read the script , so Francis Ford Coppola spent two days reading him the book that it was based on because he refused to read it himself . Coppola had similar issues with Brando when they worked together on The Godfather . Brando did n't memorize his lines on that film either , so they would place cards with his lines on them on the chests of people standing in front of Don Corleone so that Brando could just read the lines as he went .

1 Silva changes his name , for the same reason 006 changed his name in Goldeneye ( Alec Trevelyan to Janus ) , anonymity . Silva smirking at the gravestones is him coming to the realization that Bond has brought him to the home he grew up in , thinking it would be an advantage . The `` orphans '' comment was to link Bond and Silva 's pasts together as similar paths , giving the characters common ground . Additionally , it is documented in the original novels that Bond was born and raised in Scotland ( Naming the estate `` Skyfall '' was made up for the film though ) . If he was n't born there , then why would he know about the secret passageway and M does not ? If anything , Skyfall further solidifies that all the different actors are the same person . `` 007 '' is his codename .

1 The ruling was `` no '' .

1 Uncle Ray Ray 's got a game for you !

1 It looks like Ultron will be going through several versions in the movie , so we could still see a comic true incarnation , even if it 's only in there for a few seconds for the fans . as for Vision , it seems like they are holding him back as much as possible for later in the marketing .

1 i hope it gets made . looks awesome .

1 There was an album . And a music video that was ... well , David Lynch wrote a song and made a music video . Surreal . Aside from that ... no idea .

1 What you just wrote is simply beautiful .

1 I think the issue is that they consider it obscene in everything that 's not a $ 125 million Columbia / Miramax blockbuster .

1 His Joker was a fucking circus clown that listened exclusively to Prince . Least threatening villain ever . Ninja edit : these movies are very fun . I think they are very entertaining . Just not for exclusively good reasons .

1 Finally , someone else who loves this movie ! It 's my favorite romantic movie ever.It 's colorful and quirky , but has a sort of subtlety that gives the relationships and the film heart . Also , the costumes are awesome and the dancing 's phenomenal , especially the dance Scott and Fran do behind the curtain while the two champion dancers are performing .

1 I heard something along the lines as the marketing guy wanted the film 's marketing to resemble his recollection of the marketing for the original Star Wars , where it would n't be entirely clear to the audience what the actual plot of the film would be . This backfired for them big time .

1 Oh , man . That might actually be worse .

1 Yes , absolutely IMO . Remember , it was 9 felony counts , so this goes past just SJ . And he could just has well have accessed financial data , plus whatever other personal information he could get his hands on .

1 Hail Ming !

1 It 'd probably be very funny if you could see or understand it .

1 That sounds somewhat like [ Colossus : The Forbin Project ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Colossus : _The_Forbin_Project ) .

1 No Country For Old Men is pretty well known for its lack of music , so you could pick a number of other scenes from it [ like this one ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=fBqbMZ23n5o ) for example .

1 Maybe Reddit is saying that , but I 'm not . It definitely has a political message , but it was a spy movie , a superhero movie -- there were no real politics in it to speak of . Hard to ignore the NSA / CIA allegories in it , all the same .

1 Having agonizingly sat through that , you made the correct choice .

1 There 's two sequels to * The Magnificent Seven *

1 It 's not the Hunger Games .

1 Some parents brought their kid in the theater when I went to go see Wanted . He had to have been like one or two . By the end of the movie , the kid was saying `` Fuck . '' nonchalantly . Deep down , I really hope that that was the kid 's first word .

1 I actually liked Sweeney , which is strange since I usually dislike Burton films .

1 Love Ken Watanabe

1 He pretty much just acted like a real life Batman .

1 I think that the character of Lex and Walt are too similar for him to portray their differences well , and I do n't want to see Walt Luthor . They are both egomaniacs , proud , independent , ambitious , intelligent , etc. , but they are also very different . I see Lex as being a bit more like Gus Fring , actually . He 's shrewd and calculating , careful in what he does so that he achieves his criminal ends but without * directly * implicating himself . Superman , of course , knows that Lex is behind everything , but to the world , Lex is generally a respectable businessman . He hides in plain sight and does evil through his organization , not by busting up a bank or whatever . Now , Gus is still able to be emotional and vengeful ( I do n't want to post spoilers , but you know what I 'm talking about ) , but he is patient and efficient about it . I think that Bryan Cranston does well at portraying characters who let their emotions bubble over and affect their normally cool exterior ( ex , Walt making emotional decisions instead of rational ones in Breaking Bad ) , whereas Lex is amazing because of his calculating rationality . But really , the character of Lex Luthor has been done so much that you can really attribute anything to him , which leaves it up to the director to decide how he wants to define Luthor in this iteration .

1 Not a background line . This is the punchline to a major gag .

1 If they make it USE THE SAME ROBOT AND VOICE ACTOR . I swear , if it 's just a CG character and none of the human actors I 'll scream . Though I do n't like the gold version at the end of the second movie , canonically it makes sense .

1 WTF it does n't have to be either / or . Some of the best science fiction movies are action flicks meant for mass appeal .

1 I have absolutely zero guilt about my unrequited love for both of the Crank movies

1 No I was referring to the assumption that the movie would be awesome because of the inclusion of a lot of Hollywood heavyweights .

1 Will Smith looks like Will Smith . Seriously , was he born looking like he does today ? Because proportionately it 's suggested .

1 Another `` thriller with horror elements '' was Shutter Island . I think anytime you 've got major Hollywood actors ( Hopkins , Foster , DiCaprio , Kingsley , Jack Nicholson ) , you avoid making them look like idiots .

1 That line from * The Crow * is hilarious , but it 's meant to be ! It 's from a junkie who does n't have a chance of understanding what 's happening to him .

1 Is that good ?

1 Honestly , I would n't be too pissed off if they based Episode 7 entirely off of Lucas 's designs . People give the prequels a lot of flack , but , like you said , that 's primarily because he had free reign . His initial ideas for the OT were also REALLY weird , not to mention numerous and disjointed , but there were a lot of gems in the rough , so he went through them all , editing and trimming the fat until he got something good . The difference was that he never got the chance for better ideas , due to the sheer number of yes-men around him .

1 It ended up being pretty good too . Much deeper of a character study than I thought it 'd be

1 Yes , Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great on 30 Rock .

1 If you have n't already I would highly recommend [ Mongol ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Mongol_ ( film ) ( great movie about Genghis Khan 's earlier years ) or the 2004 tv series [ Genghis Khan ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Genghis_Khan_ ( 2004_TV_series ) ( the man who plays Genghis is a great actor ) .

1 It was a good ending , but I think it was supposed to leave you unsatisfied because there was so little justice . The bad guys suffered little punishment and the good guy was stuck going home on the smelly subway . In Belfort 's eyes and by his standards he had a net victory . And that was before getting a movie and more fame that will increase speaking fees , book sales , etc. , helping him recoup even more of his losses ( not to mention whatever he had hidden away ) .

1 Yeah but once every 666 years Halloween happens on the Friday the 13th that happens on a Tuesday .

1 Her breakdown when V reveals the truth about her captivity kills me . You can feel the betrayal in her voice .

1 I agree , at least where MI3 is concerned . My pet peeve of 3 is when Ethan gets into some trouble off-screen , but we only know about it because he crashes through a window . This might be a clever trick on TV , when budget can be an issue , but in a big Hollywood tentpole , I want to see the action .

1 Dude , the July 2012 issue came out in May ... 1973 . Do n't you know how the magazine industry works ?

1 It 's not as though any of the rest was any better written . > Until Gunn choices to reveal more , the Internet will have to continue to dream . Choices ? Really ?

1 and this is why we ca n't have nice things .

1 I agree . Should say , `` A digital painting I did ... '' I know a lot of pro-digital people will argue with this , but I think it 's useful to draw the distinction . Personally , I 'd be a lot more impressed if it were done in acrylic or oil .

1 I think you 're missing out by limiting it to that allegory . It 's about so many things , mostly about alienation ... Of course the film does raise many questions and thoughts about the dynamic between men and women , sex and power , but it 's more complex than `` rape '' . The way she consumed the men was very different from the way people rape each other . To her it was n't about power , manipulation , condescension , fear , or anger . She did n't see them as dumb or stupid ( in fact , most of them were pretty nice and under the impression that all of this was fully consensual . They were n't all disgusting creeps and I think people interpreting the film 's intentions that way are wrong. ) . She did n't hate them , she did n't know enough about them to hate them - and she did n't really need to : to her , those men were simply an energy source . ( In the story , as far as I know , the bodies go directly towards feeding her planet . ) She does n't really need to justify her actions . She simply uses humans in a way that benefits her own race . She spends the rest of the film wandering and observing people , trying , curiously , to understand how they work , much like a village butcher might wander a farm and pet the cows . There 's curiousity and even sympathy , but all of it at a distance : you are you , and I am me . Having spent some time on Earth , learning more about people , and having become attached to that one man , it became impossible for her to stay so distant from us / humans . So she basically became one of us . She became weak and vulnerable ( like us ) but also more emotional and beautiful , in a way ( like us ) . The film is an ode to the human race , as pompous as that sounds - the good and the bad in it . As for the ending , I did n't see it that way at all . She shed her skin because the human race had turned against her , and she yearned to turn back into what she was - unemotional , alien , purposeful . She knew she 'd never be able to fully become human - but also that she 'd never be fully alien again . She 'd never be able to fully belong in either world again . She was basically doomed to be a purposeless outcast . But I do n't think she accepted her death . She was killed before she could even decide that much . It 's a very hopeless , horrific ending ( I think ) . I 've mentioned this before but I really suggest anyone who 's intrigued by this film watches `` The Man Who Fell to Earth '' - also a great film . `` Under the Skin '' was clearly inspired by it and deals with many similar elements .

1 No ? It was in theaters back during summertime and it only just came out on Netflix . It 's a much better movie than you think .

1 I 've watched the rape scene in Irreversible . Twice . I 've seen countless beheadings , stabbings , shootings , etc all to varying degrees of realism and violence . I watched the ending to Audition and laughed . And I still have n't been able to keep my eyes on the curb stomp from AHX in the several times I 've watched it .

1 Dredd obviously was much better than the original film . I would also say the new Planet of the Apes films are pretty good overall . I enjoyed them more than the original film , although they 're quite different storyline wise .

1 I watched Jupiter Ascending yesterday without really knowing anything about it as I just saw it was streaming for me . I really liked the idea , cast was good , but it felt a bit empty . What 's the general opinion on Jupiter Ascending ?

1 The events of Foxcatcher .

1 She was rumoured for the Harley Quinn role too . I guess sans the acting capability , she got the creepy cute look down .

1 Pretty sure that 's what the upvote button is for ( milking this purely for my own upvotes )

1 Still there is no need to post the same news over and over again , especially when it is such a breaking news item . It 's not even like they were posted at the same time either . They were coming even an hour after it was announced

1 More insanity . Admittedly I saw the movie after reading the book , but I do n't understand how anyone could even follow the nuances of the plot if they had n't read the book . Not to mention all the stuff the cut and used in Godfather II was some of the best stuff in the book .

1 The War Zone made no money . People ca n't just choose to be directors . It 's a job like any other . You are hired as a director and you have to prove you can deliver what the studio wants ( generally in financial terms ) . Most directors do not have a free hand directing , either . Contrary to public belief , studios are intimately involved in virtually every decision about a film . Combine these factors and it seems likely Roth did not enjoy directing and / or studios believe he is more valuable as an actor .

1 I 'd guess 9-12ish is who they were aiming for .

1 Shaun of the Dead

1 Reasonably speaking , I do n't think [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` they can ever kill bond . Looking at it as whether someone accomplishes their objectives or not . Bond fails to save M , and Silva succeeds in killing M. Technically it was a necessary means to change the role of M and Bond perhaps emerges a better man because of it . But while I agree that it did n't feel like Bond lost , I think in this case you could argue that he did . Compared to casino royale , in which Bond lives to fight another day , but loses Vesper . She was a loss , similar to M , but her survival was not central to the objectives . Bond still succeeded in his mission . '' )

1 Would n't call it genius . I think it 's called `` leitmotif '' , and it 's pretty common .

1 Samuel L. Jackson . Every . Damn . Movie .

1 I love the Friday the 13th remake . It 's so absolutely ridiculous that it 's hard not to like it . I mean come on , `` Your tits are stupendous ! '' is probably my favorite movie line ever . I 'm so pumped for the next one . Because we all know Jason will never die .

1 Domestic = / = total though . Moonrise Kingdom only did 68 million worldwide , while GBH is over 100 million worldwide . GBH is killing it internationally .

1 First comment : > Thank you , Harrison Ford but your wife is in another castle ?

1 Barry 's or Wesker 's picture behind his desk at the raccoon police department ! It amazes me someone else was thinking of this ; being such an obscure thing .

1 People were `` used '' to handling lead without protective equipment and working 12 hour days too . There 's no reason layoffs * have * to be part of the job , outside of convenience for the company that hired you .

1 All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts . I aim to keep it that way . You can stay till morning . Then I do n't ever want to see you again .

1 8-bit originally referred to the CPU architecture it ran on . There 's a massive world of difference between an [ 8-bit architecture ] ( http : / c64.kset.org / shots / 259.png ) game and an [ 8-bit colour palette ] ( http : / static.zenimax.com / bethblog / oldcontent / DOOM_II_SP_02.jpg ) game . The `` pixelly and few colours '' effect should use a very limited 8 or 16 colour palette and , generally , a resolution of between 80x60 and 300x200 .

1 C'mon man , what the fuck ? It says NO SPOILERS ! Now I do n't need to see it .

1 Pretty sure Brendan would have done a better job than a CGI character like JarJar .

1 I 'd hope they are very far along since they shoot next year !

1 Life is easy . You make choices , and you do n't look back .

1 I know , but there was always the possibility they 'd make him canon again , which is what I meant . They do it sometimes , like with Darth Bane , Korriban ( well , `` Moribund '' now ) , Quinlan Vos , etc .

1 I know she wo n't be the right age , but If we all learnt something from this movie is to STFU and wait to see the actual movie before making random claims because you may think is not going to be good . Right now I 'm interested to see how the whole son / daughter / dad thing plays out .

1 great movie , was n't ( that ) scary though

1 I do vaguely remember [ Stripes ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0083131 / ) having this sort of scene .

1 its like poetry ... it sort of rhymes .

1 No . [ Talia Al Ghul is an actual Batman character . ] ( / spoiler ) So ... No .

1 Cabin in the Woods was great because my friends and I were the only ones * laughing * throughout the movie . The rest of the theater was screaming , freaking out , etc . Meanwhile we were having the time of our lives . It got better when the movie ended and we heard people talking about wanting to get their money back because the movie had false advertising .

1 Note to everyone : Braindead is the title of Dead / Alive in countries other than the US .

1 Well good thing we are n't dating then .

1 You should also check out Castle in the Sky and Princess Mononoke . Beautiful animation .

1 It was good that he had a particular set of skills to find Albert with .

1 I think the idea was that in `` the further , '' time is n't really an object since it 's basically a realm of the dead .

1 If he was on his deathbed , that 's pretty much how he 'd be breathing too ...

1 Correct

1 Pretty obvious answer , but the first film I saw that really stunned me mostly in a visual way was 2001 .

1 You chimed into a comment tree talking about actors in movies with over 60 % critical praise . Your thoughts on the quality of the movies are completely irrelevant . Might as well start talking about F-14s , caterpillars , or tacos and then bitch about how people are downvoting you . This ai n't rocket science . Find a submission that says `` what are your thoughts on the Harry Potter series ? '' and you wo n't be downvoted .

1 Except , you made me check the wrong username ! I had no idea why OccamsChainsaw was so bad .

1 The movie adaptation of Tobias Funke 's `` The man inside me '' .

1 Ah , I see you 're taking part in the motherfuckingaissance

1 i think pretty much all the original writers from the Simpsons were ivy-leaguers

1 It 's always nice to see something not related to * Prometheus * on here once and a while . Also , mad props for Fellini .

1 So many of the awards it did n't get nominated for had nothing to do with Affleck .

1 Should n't whether or not Fincher pulls it off or not be a non-factor in getting a Screenplay Oscar ?

1 Hilarious movie , I loved it . What really sold that movie for me was John C. Riley , but the whole movie is pretty funny

1 He mentioned one time while introducing Jeremy Renner that while filming SWAT they went to Tijuana and got super drunk and did a bunch of crazy stuff . I was a little jealous ... not being there

1 That is simply incorrect . If you mean that they are all inked and colored digitally , that 's still all done by hand , instead of ink against cell though , it 's a stylus against a cintiq monitor . Either way requires virtually the same skill set .

1 C'mon ... Why reboot a franchise when you can murder it with a shitty sequel ?

1 Yeah , the Bill Cosby reference also made me tense up and cringe ... But as for the Kanye connection , my wife pointed that out and that others have wondered whether he acted as an `` adviser '' to the scriptwriters about what it 's like to be marrying someone who has no talent and who is obsessed with their reality show ...

1 Stories about David O. Russell have led me to believe that he is a sociopath .

1 Why do people keep on forgetting that nick fury is a lying liar who lies ? That guy is like the ultra spy . If he tells you something that you know is the truth then you 're probably wrong on some level . If he falls it 's because he wants physics to believe that gravity still works .

1 No . not since `` Paul Blart : Mall Cop ''

1 Nah . It was just a ripoff of the diesel truck sequence in T2 except , `` Oh hey , now it 's a bigger truck ! ''

1 That is an upgrade . The new suit definitely looks more like the comics and just looks more appealing overall . Especially the mask .

1 You have some weird issues .

1 I . Fucking . LOVE . Penguins !

1 Rant is a crazy story ... I love Palahniuk

1 I love some of the above mentioned artists , and I 'd love to see them score movies because they can pull off incredible mood pieces , but you 're right . Other than fitting under the same gigantic umbrella of `` electronic music '' , they 're not that similar to the artists featured in Drive . Still , it 's not like it hurts the original cut to try out different scores . It 's a challenge for the artists I suppose .

1 Loki was n't really protecting humanity . He 's just.. kind of a dick .

1 She had more personality than Ramona . I agree with everything you say about Knives , and I chalk all that up to her being 17 . I guess I can see how she changed at the end of the film and thought , `` Yeah that character has learned form her mistakes and has grown up a bit . '' I guess that is what I liked about her . Ultimately though , I 'd take Kim over them all .

1 Moreflicks.com ?

1 He never said it was a secret .

1 I upvote this one . Typically movies have the `` Show me , do n't tell me '' rule applied , so whatever the last thing you were shown is what you accept as reality . So if you see the gates open , but do n't close , then they 're still open until you see them close . And anyone who says they 're closed , they 're lying until you actually see that its closed .

1 There seems to be a thing with animated films that all marketing must appeal to children and make a film appear to be nothing but a silly children 's movie . The worst example of this was A Christmas Carol with Jim Carrey . The preview included all 2 minutes of 'silly ' stuff from the film , whereas the film itself was a very dark recreation of the book . If I took my children to that under the pretense it was anything like the preview , I would have been pretty angry .

1 I thought it was over when it pans back from a closed door then fades to black , and you just hear muffled screams . I thought most of it would remain implied . Nope .

1 This looks hilarious .

1 film rights not TV rights .

1 Because film has been overtaken by digital video and digital cameras , the correct term is 'file ' . `` Are files still considered files when the overall gross surpasses its budget ? ''

1 When Tokyo is ashes , then you have my permission to drive .

1 Go ahead and boycott them , im sure this will only fuel Collectors to buy them faster .

1 Dark Knight is way condescending .

1 I am going to agree with you . My rationale for it , is that this film was trying to fill the somber , quiet tone that Superman Returns left audiences with . It focused less on Superman as a super being and more of a human . With little action and driving force , it was arguably boring . This film on the other hand was almost non stop action , and while entertaining at first , it began to lose it 's value as the battles wore on . The film had some truly beautiful moments ; the bus being saved , the death of his father , him finding the ship in the ice , to name the prominent ones . But they just were n't enough . If anything , I would argue that the film suffered from an identity crisis of trying to be a deep film focused on the pain of being a god among men , and a film where we get to see a guy fucking throw a guy through a building while a giant dubstep machine pummels cities into dust . Personally , I did not hate this film , but it did not leave a good taste in my mouth the first time I saw it . I will be the first to admit that I am not a Superman fan , but I was expecting something more even . For me , the main issue was pacing ; not the actors , not the story , not the script , not the aesthetics , not the score . It rushed to get to the final show down and it stayed there for half an hour . But I can say that I absolutely loved Superman showing Zod what his back looks like .

1 Troop Beverly Hills was awesome !

1 Then you become the dude interrupting the movie by instigating a fight . Employees do n't mind ( in my experience ) . Some even enjoy tossing obnoxious patrons out .

1 Robocop ... .one of the best 80 's movie of all time !

1 This was on the front page a few hours ago .

1 And I 'm not trying to insult his work on In Living Color , I grew up on that shit and it was hilarious .

1 If you 're expectations are for a spoof comedy , I found the movie bet enjoyable .

1 > but I 'd love to see what Apatow could do with this franchise . I 'm sorry man , but frankly it 's enough already . It would n't be `` Ghostbusters 3 '' it would just be `` Another Judd Apatow movie '' . Hollywood has decided he only gets to make one type of movie now , or he 's done enough in his career that he only wants to make one type of movie anymore . I 've already seen that movie . It was good the first time , still pretty good the second , then slid quickly from `` OK '' to `` We can just skip the next one '' .

1 I honestly did n't even notice . I only noticed the pirate one , and I liked that .

1 I bet there 's a term , but it probably ends in `` -punk '' . `` Vacuum-punk '' ? `` Nuclear-punk '' ? As a nod to Fallout , `` Vault-punk '' ?

1 In what way ? That seems like exactly what that movie deserves .

1 heh . well , you 're right about hitler , but black slaves did actually get freed from time to time back then in america for various reasons .

1 I 'd actually argue the opposite , despite some memorable movies , 2012 was pretty forgettable .

1 There are tons of people who simply refuse to watch it because they hear it 's propaganda , and yet I have never heard someone who HAS seen it agree .

1 I think it 's because he 's a good guy , IRL .

1 It 's bad because you can only seem more sophisticated by saying so . Do n't expect any actual citations .

1 HA

1 Knowing musicians and being a former musician this movie definitely show what being a working musician is like for a lot of people . I need to rewatch it ... I already know there is so much more to be found in the movie .

1 All I feel this movie was trying to tell me is that most spies were gay back then

1 They were both great . Let 's not pretend like Jean 's performance was easy just because we like Oldman more . You have to be a real showman to pull off that role .

1 Exactly , there is nothing to go on . I wish it was an actual trailer rather than an unrelated short .

1 That gif just gave me seizures ... of the sexy kind .

1 The fate ... of the world ... rests in yous twos hands .

1 I suppose they all look alike to you , right , Costanza ?

1 Kevin is good friends with Harley 's creator Paul Dini , so that 's why she was named that . Plus , people do n't usually mention their middle names , so most would just call her Harley Smith , and it 's not like Harley 's not a real name .

1 The one in the film looked like a sea shell or some kind of spiral thing

1 My ass !

1 The whole movie was garbage . Complete lack of coherency , shallow emotional depth , a storyline to defy even a comic book reader of suspension of disbelief , and it did n't even have any decent action to fall back on . Superman Returns was amazingly bad .

1 I 'm glad to see the Skeksis get a node .

1 I just want to begin by saying I had almost no expectations . I am not a * massive * Marvel fan ( though I 've liked a lot of the movies ) , and had no idea what Age of Ultron was about besides the fact the Avengers take on a killer robot . My post was built on the expectations I generated * while * watching the movie . The set-up was all Stark . He got his own special vision of the future before anyone else , and acted from there . He talks Banner into helping create the Ultron project . Ultron marks him as the one he hates most . Act 1 is the story of Tony Stark creating a monster , and in doing so discovering the worst part of himself writ large . The idea of creators bringing about their own destruction fits with that , and it 's an * extremely * prominent theme through the movie and possibly even the entire point , like you say . But the problem is that is n't satisfying given the way things play out . It does n't build off of the setup and complication . Given the way it played out , Act 2 ought to have been about Stark confronting that monster within himself and learning that he does n't embody the worst qualities that Ultron represents . This then equips him for the showdown in Act 3 . It is n't , though . Act 2 culminates in a fight between the Avengers as to whether or not they should let Stark do exactly what he did in Act 1 all over again . It 's a really bizarre and jarring turn . A couple of lines of dialogue between Ultron and the Twins do n't cast it in a different light . ( This is where I think comic knowledge is a key difference ) To me , it is * very * obvious Vision is entirely a creation of Tony Stark . He 's literally Jarvis in a body . Dr Cho created the body , Tony Stark created the AI implanted within it . On the evidence of the film , Vision is another one of Stark 's creations , not Ultron 's . That 's what I meant by Stark fobbing off his problems on to yet another creation to defeat the first creation . That it works makes it seem like a really odd tangent to Act 1 . Even granting it , though , the movie still lacks personal stakes . Who has to learn something through this movie that leads to the destruction of Ultron in Act 3 ? It * should * be Stark , since he 's the one Act One promised it would be , but it is n't . It should * not * be Vision , because a character introduced at the end of Act 2 is n't around long enough for the audience to invest in and can have nothing to learn , anyway . The idea behind Act 3 is to show off what the Main Character in Act 1 learned during Act 2 , yeah ? There 's a reason that formula works : it 's satisfying , and neat , and straightforward . Nearly all western movies follow it . So , the Avengers is an ensemble piece . Maybe , like in the first movie , the ALL need to learn something about working together ? Turns out no . Do they rally around each other , determined to prove that the creation does not always destroy the creator ? No , not that , either . Nobody learns anything , or overcomes a personal obstacle that was previously stopping them from winning the fight . Instead there is Vision , and for me at least , he was a super unsatisfying lead in to the final act . I 'm kind of just thinking out loud here . I 'm going back to see it again tomorrow because I enjoyed it for what it is , I just think the flaws that come from having to deal with so * many * characters made the wheels come off about two thirds in . Vision was a useless addition to the movie . I 'll go so far as to say the Maximoff Twins were also a useless addition to the movie . It would have been a much better film if it was Iron Man 4 .

1 Goonies vs . Aliens . Yeah , that one was so ... Spielberg

1 Kansas .

1 The only one of those I 'd even consider calling a `` chick flick '' is 500 Days of Summer . Rom-com does n't necessarily mean chick flick , and hell , I would n't even feel comfortable classing Eternal Sunshine as the former . All fantastic movies , though .

1 Not many people were unarmed in that area at the time .

1 I think that they cut most of the scenes due to the change in actors .

1 I think all the `` witty '' lines make it really obvious Whedon is a tv guy .

1 I agree . In Twilight she is playing a character who was written to be hollow and lifeless so it is easier for the teeny boppers and soccer moms who read it to put themselves in the characters shoes . Add that to the already shitty script and of course she looks like a bad actress .

1 Not that different , it 's based on the [ Peter David version ] ( http : / www.monitorduty.com / imgs / oldimages / Aquaman % 20fish % 20army.jpg ) .

1 That 's not really so far off from the comics where SHEILD always seems to fall into the role of evil-fascistic oppressive global police force whenever Nick Fury is n't incharge .

1 This is more like a kernel upgrade ... Damn I hope there is a giant spider in this one !

1 Just read the plot summary on Wikipedia ... . yikes ! O_O

1 That still has nothing to do with anything . Most people will still do something for their benefit regardless of how they feel about the subject . Voting or going to the doctor or even working are all wonderful examples . Explaining how they feel about the something they are going to do regardless is not the same as reasons why they do it .

1 There 's got to be a better way of saying that .

1 You should watch it , it 's very good .

1 Growing up he was bullied quite a bit . I wonder what effects that has had on him . Every time a video of him goes viral , he 's being an absolute badass though , stopping fights , hanging out with fans .

1 I heard that you 've been posting this story on other places , and that it changes each time ; what 's up with that ?

1 I 'm perfectly okay with this . Harry Potter 's story has been told . Coming back to him would just be superfluous .

1 Personally , I felt that the movie failed on a few objective qualities . For instance , the editing on a scene-to-scene basis often muddled spacial relationships . ( Notably , the scene where Cooper pulls the lever and sends himself into the black hole . ) Not to mention countless subjective qualms I have about it . I do n't dislike it because I did n't understand it . In fact , contrary to what you say , I disliked it for its `` artistic integrity or intent . '' And I think I express pretty commonly held opinions on the movie . I 'm really tired of people saying Interstellar naysayers did n't understand it . I do n't know how one could n't understand it . It 's not very complicated .

1 I know , only 86 % ? ? ?

1 The plane sequence was fantastic as well .

1 hit it

1 Are the international theatres TBC ? It only has the dates so far . UK based .

1 Like I said , I 'm not saying I think for sure it 's going to be bad . I just think , considering the director 's track record , it 's unreasonable to tell people that their negative expectations are unfounded . I personally did n't like the trailer much .

1 Weird , I 've always known it as Equilibrium . Even when it was shown in TV , they never used the name Cubic . TIL .

1 Are you craze ? !

1 For that particular planet , yes . They 're an advanced race of homosapien look-alikes , they 're supposed to be relatable in a world full of weird aliens , so they make it look like a future utopian Earth .

1 Geeze , I 've read a good bit about script writing and have studied writing in general here and there and found what you wrote is quite insightful . I 'd like to read more about this point you 've made . Any reading suggestions ?

1 > different to filming a movie about a war on the day that the war is being remembered . Yep because the movie is remembering the war . Seems like they were doing exactly what you wanted .

1 walking dead is ass

1 She was in many movies before Speed . Demolition Man , The Vanishing , Love Potion No . 9 , and others .

1 Haha love the title . And an excellent choice .

1 Right , neither one plays music anymore .

1 and then the sequel `` Bourne Yesterday ''

1 I 'm surprised how many people have n't seen this movie . I 'm pretty sure everyone has heard the soundtrack at some point in their life , but it seems the movie has slipped into obscurity somewhat .

1 The allure of cinema popcorn .

1 Well , I had n't really thought of it until your post , but if we 're going to go down this road : Look at the end and the escape pod scene . The pod submerges under water and in addition to just being a tense and scary escape scene , Bullock has to pass out of the pod ( womb ) through the hatch ( vagina ) under water ( amniotic fluid ) before breaking through the surface and being born again back home on Earth with her new self worth and purpose in life . And taking her first , shaky steps as she does . Interesting .

1 You were better off ...

1 It was a joke , in reference to the recent Mel Gibson scandal .

1 That was in Pulp Fiction .

1 Yes , I was surprised that he did n't have a greater career after this . He really was the perfect foil to Arnie . I loved the conversation where he went on about the guy 'banging your wife ' and Arnie about to blow up .

1 One of my favorite movies ever . Definitely not underrated , just not very popular .

1 RT has average critic ratings too because even they know the difference is important .

1 Really enjoyed Funny People , though it admittedly ran long since even the smallest side characters get lots of love and full story lines .

1 That 's not weird , it just means you are a special kind of douchebag that labels people into specific categories that will never truly appreciate all that life has to offer because of your narrowmindedness . It 's ok , at least you 'll never be alone in that regard .

1 A Trip to the Moon ? Duck Dogers ? Akira ? As always , beautiful posters . Thank you , Mondo .

1 it 's the same as a kid buying a ticket to see a PG movie and then sneaking into an R rated movie . It 's been happening for as long as there has been restrictions on movie viewing .

1 based off those , just check out the rest of the movies in the imdb top 250 , post-1970 .

1 I like to think The Big Lebowski and Pulp Fiction occurred simultaneously , in the same movieverse .

1 The Abyss is a fucking awesome movie . Sphere was a really good book turned into a crappy movie .

1 If this ends up doing well , I can see Toho being okay with selling the rights to more of their characters .

1 It does n't make much sense either . Rocky was supposed to be a washed up boxer past his prime in the first film . How does he suddenly become the greatest boxer in the world in the second , and manage to keep it up for each subsequent movie ?

1 did u think u could just hide a 30 rock episode in there and no one would notice ? ? ?

1 I 'd say that their debut is memorable , it 's fun , catchy , juuust different enough to hold your attention , and there 's no bad tracks on the album ( some are meh , but none are bad ) . I fear for their future though , I do n't think they can ride the same shtick for too long , I 've even kinda dismissed their newer songs ( I Just Wan na Die and Awkward are forgettable at best ) .

1 But better yet , make it the sort of creepy that only adults get . So make it a kid 's comedy , adult 's horror , where the kids are just `` bored '' by the long parts .

1 Ghetto it up ? Yikes

1 Michael Jai White is already Jax in the Mortal Kombat web series . I believe he will be maintaining the role for the upcoming WB movie as well .

1 I rented this thinking it was something by Joss Whedon and ended up with a face full of tears .

1 Why would n't he be ?

1 The Human Centipede . A romantic love story involving two girls and the guy they just ca n't get away from .

1 I can agree with that . I absolutely loved The King 's Speech and I just ca n't get enough of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush . Tom Hooper did a beautiful job with this movie , as did the writer David Seidler and DoP Danny Cohen . I would say just about every element of the movie worked together incredibly well to make a moving story both visually and narratively . The King 's Speech beating out The Social Network is n't as far fetched as some people make it out to be .

1 Young males on the Internet do n't like Christianity ? Knock me over with a feather !

1 I hear the original only got an 11 % on Rotten Tomatoes ... Soooo ... .

1 Again , a well renowned book that 's been out for decades , it 's up to you to read it , not for society to be quiet about discussing it . I understand getting upset about spoilers . Outwardly if the content is recent , inwardly if it 's something that I wanted to see / read but never did .

1 `` sigh '' god dammit , this is why we ca n't have nice things !

1 That line was ad-libbed

1 1 ) that was a cheesy line , but awesome . 2 ) He was popping drugs to keep himself alive . He probably did n't have long to live at that rate . 3 ) They were checking for compatibility in fighting styles , so they wo n't want to do drastically different things when fighting the kaiju .

1 `` Ohhhhh , thank you for correcting my English which stinks . ''

1 He does n't diss people who make best of lists , he 's dissing those who make their lists exactly when 2012 ends . He thinks you should n't make a best of list for 2012 when eligible movies are left out for the sake of getting your video out as soon as possible . He thinks it defeats the purpose and I agree .

1 I do too . IMO : 1 ) A New Hope 2 ) Empire Strikes Back 3 ) Revenge of the Sith 4 ) Return of the Jedi -- -- -- -- -- -- - 5 ) Phantom Menace 6 ) Attack of the Clones

1 I thought this as well . Read the title > Alan Turing ? s biographer criticises upcoming biopic for downplaying gay identity and thought `` well , did n't Turing try to downplay his gay identity too ? '' It was a private matter for him EDIT : He refused to deny it , but also refused to make it his sole identity . He was very much his own man

1 No . But you 're in a VERY small minority .

1 I was gon na jump onto the hate train until you jogged my memory . Everything up until Safe House and Buried was Ryan Reynolds playing the same Van Wilde character in every movie . Although I do look forward to him resuming the tone in the upcoming `` Deadpool '' movie as the attitude fits perfectly with the comic character .

1 Nope its just the immediate aftermath where society is still trying to hold it together . That and it takes place in the more populated areas whereas 2 and 3 take place in the forbidden / forsaken areas . They are a progression of a fossilfueless aftermath , and the gradual decline of civilization .

1 I want to be so badass that when I make a pouty squeezed-lips face , people call it badass .

1 I do n't see it is all that different from a news outlet reporting on snippets of an interesting interview . I think Ethan Hawke gave one of the most interesting actor AMAs that I have read .

1 Dude - you reported it , I spammed it , I RTS 'd it , and less than half an hour passed .

1 I do n't see why that 's a problem . Max is simply a mature adult male , who gets into adventures here and there in a post-Apocalyptic world . It 's like a comic book series like Tintin . He 's ageless . I do n't see why we 'd need an older Max . That 's actually kind of clich ? and would be done only because the original actor aged ( like Indiana Jones.. ) . They can make one eventually if it 's useful to the plot . But I 'd rather have it in Roadwarrior and Fury Road format . Conan , however , has a specific timeline which is grounded in a fantasy `` reality '' ( not trying to make an oxymoron ) . He becomes a king , and is necessarily older at the end of his `` saga '' . It helps that Arnold reached the ripe age for it .

1 Its an article about a movie director . It has some relevance in this sub reddit , albeit not much until it goes to trial .

1 No , he didnt . He claims to have `` over-paid '' the victims , but he has n't paid back the $ 110,000,000 that he agreed to pay in 2003 to 1,513 victims .

1 Finally somebody picked John Ford ! I was starting to think people had n't seen any movies before the 90s .

1 Se7en ?

1 There are so many songs in that movie that I get this with . Another prominent one is Runnin on Empty .

1 I do . Not brilliant , but I enjoyed it . : D Fuck Humanity .

1 Are you sure ?

1 It 's something Peter Griffin says in Family Guy when he thinks they are all about to die .

1 Tell me about it .

1 who would have the balls to fill those shoes ?

1 That would need parts of Canada , too .

1 A few songs got changed around ... but I think the DC ended up giving too much away to the audience . The original film was more confusing and thus more interesting . I still like the DC though . Swayze as positive-thinking paedophile was brilliant .

1 Oh god dammit not this comment again .

1 Yeah and theres nothing wrong with that approach but peoples criticism is that they did a really bad job of the human perspective .

1 I have n't tried with liquor bottles but with wine bottles you can generally soak them in the sink and the glue will release . Slide it off the bottle and face down on to a paper towel to dry .

1 Oh yeah , that was hilariously obvious . Maybe he just suddenly tensed up

1 He 's already Mad Max . I like him but I do n't think every 80 's action franchise should be rebooted with him .

1 What he should have done was put him in touch with Edna . She would have both appreciated his talents and been able to keep up better than anyone else .

1 Right up until a major movie is released and then my opinion becomes null and wrong .

1 even more than that , the one passing remark says that it is n't happening .

1 [ The resemblance is uncanny ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / aBW0dXO.jpg ) .

1 Exactly .

1 It 's barely a concept

1 Me too , it 's so great to rewatch . Get something out of it everytime

1 That 's exactly what Clooney 's hoping we all do .

1 : D accidentally exposed nationality

1 There 's a Jack at my school who 's last name is Hoffman .

1 It said during the movie they were waiting the whole time for Joe Cabot to get there so they could take him down .

1 `` Tarantino had n't been calling , and the mortgage was due . ''

1 * pow * sorry boot that

1 Space balls 3 : journey to find spaceballs 2

1 Willem Dafoe , Harvey Keitel , Tom Wilkinson , Jude Law , Edward Norton , Jason Schwartzman , Tilda Swinton ... So many unknowns !

1 Because you want to see if it is possible to breathe life into an old concept that is n't based on car chase and explosion porn . Since Hollywood is so dead for ideas , at least it is n't the 7th remake of the same comic book story or a high concept mash-up like `` Transformers : Madea '' .

1 Customer : Cute cat , what 's it 's name ? Randall : 'Annoying customer ' . Customer : Fuck you !

1 I agree . Meeting Don Logan would be like being thrown a live hand grenade .

1 But still , Steve Buscemi .

1 Awesome . Thanks man .

1 I like the way they think .

1 No all the monster in this Godzilla are original , Toho did n't give them any other license

1 It 's a hundred times better . I still have enjoyed the Hobbit films but they had potential to be leagues better than they are .

1 i honestly do n't think that he 's as versatile as people make him out to be . he clearly does well in the roles that he 's done so far but the main theme is that each character he 's played has some kind of chip on their shoulder . each character he plays is also a borderline villain ( even batman ) . i could never see him in a role like Ryan Gosling in Blue Valentine or Martin Freeman in the Hobbit

1 Never go full retard & # 3232 ; \_ & # 3232 ;

1 They just went and made new dinosaurs ? Probably not a good idea .

1 I can still watch Braveheart and enjoy it , there 's no way I 'm watching that piece of shit Crash .

1 Please provide proof that The Raid stole the script to do a copy ( dredd starting production first is not proof ) . Otherwise , just accept the fact that two different filmmakers had similar ideas for a movie at roughly the same time . Nobody stole anything .

1 Have you even watched it ? ? ?

1 `` The description comes from Latino Review '' ... and that 's when I stopped reading .

1 I re-watched that last week , thought it was funny how many more actors I recognized since the first time I watched it . You can pretty much bank on there being at least one Game of Thrones actor in every British film that came out in the last 10 years .

1 Thats `` Andy Serkis as Caesar in a scene from ? Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. ? ( Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp . via Associated Press ) ? Rise of the Planet of the Apes ? is about the lead-up to an epidemic , while ? Dawn of the Planet of the Apes ? is set in its aftermath . As is so often the case with post-apocalyptic or dystopian fiction , the franchise is not really interested in how people make decisions during crises or in identifying the moments when crises become irreversible . ''

1 somethin ' like a PHENOMENON

1 Wow I wholly disagree . To each his own but I felt the sequel brought out a level of seriousness and maturity the first one could n't express because they were so young . The scene where his father approached his mother ( who essentially abandoned them ) and immediately forgave her brought a tear to my eye . I thought it was clever , charming , serious , and beautiful . Liked it a bit more than the first one tbh .

1 Great find , congrats

1 One Heston was fucking enough

1 Absolutely ! The satire reflects this reality better than serious media ever have been able to .

1 Gene Wilder is the man

1 And The Prestige of the same year !

1 The higher framerate helps . A lot .

1 The Sum of All Fears and Gozilla ( 1998 ) are two that come to mind

1 Bill the fucking Butcher .

1 What a fantastic film , with incredible acting from Philip Seymour Hoffman . The scene where he [ plays the fairy game with his daughter ] ( http : / youtu.be / 7NANYiWjy04 ) is pretty beautiful too .

1 There is Robotech : The Macross Saga ( the first season of Robotech ) and then there is SDF Macross . Robotech was an American mashup by Harmony Gold of SDF Macross , Southern Cross , and Mospeada into a three season cartoon . In order to make these three separate series work together , they changed the plot a small amount and made a surprisingly coherent story . SDF Macross was the first in the series of the Macross Franchise . It does have an original English Dub which was done by ADV and it retains the same story and even one VA from the Japanese original . The final battle in [ DYRL ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=wckZcVFLU24 ) is probably the best example of `` idols '' that the original Macross regularly has in their series . Newer series like Macross [ Frontier ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=AyxOgud3VP4 ) is a little more blatant about it ( warning : the frontier video is a slight spoiler ) .

1 I would n't call them a `` sequel machine '' . No offence , but I think it 's silly how dramatic people are about Pixar lately . They 've done two sequels since the incredible reception that Toy Story 3 got , and they 've got one in production , with three original movies in production alongside it .

1 I 'd like an HBO series about the rise and fall of the Viking Empire . I do n't mean purely historical , but rather following the vein of Game of Thrones or The Sopranos . Developing a cast of characters and running through key historical events for that group every two seasons . And when those two seasons end , they move on to the next generation . I do n't know why , but seeing someone actually pray to the old gods , or the sea and land based raids , or even the games and challenges would be really cool for me . I mean , I enjoyed Eaters of the Dead ( book that 13th warrior is loosely based on ) , and I think following it with the full grit and effort HBO could put behind it would be amazing . But , that 's just me . -An example of awesome that is historical vikings http : / www.badassoftheweek.com / stamfordbridge.html

1 considering it was written by seth and evan about their own lives back then , the movie probably just updated technology to the script to keep up with the times .

1 > unexpectedly really though ? does anybody expect it to win ?

1 Obviously they 're dated . But they come from * before Toy Story * . And they still look better than , say , the wolves in Twilight . That 's pretty impressive . The circlejerk is absolutely justified in this case , imo .

1 I found that out 5 seconds after I posted that but I could not bother to correct myself .

1 Straight from the co-writer herself : `` What starts to happen as the movie progresses is that what you 're seeing is what 's going on in his head . So when he shoots a car and it explodes , even he for a second is like `` Huh ? '' because even he is starting to believe that his perception of reality can not be right . As he goes more crazy , what you actually see becomes more distorted and harder to figure out , but it 's meant to be that he is really killing all these people , it 's just that he 's probably not as nicely dressed , it probably did n't go as smoothly as he is perceiving it to go , the hookers probably were n't as hot etc etc etc It 's just Bateman 's fantasy world . ''

1 I do n't understand . Did you think the freeze-frame was too cheesy ?

1 I bet it wo n't be funny .

1 I watched it a few days ago and I thought it was really good . You wo n't be disappointed story wise .

1 i though it was great . Very funny , especially Rockwell .

1 Have the host ( s ) of an award show ever appeared less in the show they 're hosting ?

1 Have n't seen this one .

1 In the MCU ( Marvel cinematic universe ) there is a person called Kevin Feige which is spearheading this franchise with some close producers aswell as having BIG input from select directors ( Whedon , Favreau in the beginning , Russo bros ) . Spider man series is owned by Sony and i do not know entirely who is spearheading their franchise , i know they have a tendency to think only about money unlike MCU which thinks Great movies and fan service = Money . X-men is mainly decided by Lauren Shuler Donner i have come to believe . Stan Lee has no input into Marvel movies at all any longer .

1 It 's fucking badass and Christopher Nolan is the shit .

1 The original was a dystopian future where a fuel crisis existed , but there were still major cities . Was n't quite the end of civilization yet . The Road Warrior takes place after an actual apocalyptic war .

1 Tommy Lee Jones in [ MiB ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0119654 / quotes ? qt=qt0997317 ) > A person is smart . People are dumb , panicky dangerous animals and you know it . Fifteen hundred years ago everybody knew the Earth was the center of the universe . Five hundred years ago , everybody knew the Earth was flat , and fifteen minutes ago , you knew that humans were alone on this planet . Imagine what you 'll know tomorrow .

1 Yea Depp and HST were close , Depp paid built a god damn cannon to shoot the ashes of HST . I think Depp will do a few more HST between his cashcow Pirate adventures etc . I 'd be 100 % ok with that .

1 Nope , it was * awful *

1 Your definition of film critic = my definition of film theorist . Your definition of film reviewer = the world 's definition of film critic . My definition of film reviewer = people on reddit . It 's mind boggling how capriciously dismissively you are of Ebert due to his layman-accessibility . I find him just as poignant as Stanley Kauffmann or Robert Warshow . Well ... maybe not Warshow . It 's just that he 's in the trenches of commercialization , which frees him to be more personal with his reviews , unlike your film critics / theorists . Ebert has done more for imparting understanding of film for the world than pretty much any film theorist , simply by way of reaching a larger audience and speaking their language . I do n't see the general population running out to grab the latest David Thompson book . Both critics / theorists and critics / reviewers have their place , and Ebert might not have the catalog of film theory you want , but he 's hardly lacking depth because of a few insights you did n't agree with . Plus , you 're making assumptions about his `` most western actors are overactors '' comment . He did n't say `` stars '' he said `` actors . '' Pretty sure he 's speaking in macro terms .

1 TL ; DR : Helicopters

1 protip : Unless it is somehow relevant , ditch the stupid memes . `` Does anybody have a higher res version of this ? '' Much better then `` LOL Y U NO HD XD '' do n't you think ?

1 I thought * The Times of Harvey Milk * was great . I watched it after * Milk * and I liked the doc far better .

1 Well , there 's a few nails in the coffin still needs to be hammered . Besides , cinema had a couple-a resurrections now and then .

1 They talk about this in the scene , someone asks him in the end `` so what IS the color of the boathouse '' , and he replies something like `` How would I know ? ''

1 Even though he has visible tattoos over his entire chest.. ?

1 Agreed . Do n't think because it 's George Clooney / Jennifer Lopez that it 's some sort of romantic comedy . Steven Soderbergh , Don Cheadle , Albert Brooks , Steve Zahn , Ving Rhames , Dennis Faurina , Catherine Keener ... the acting and directing are outstanding . It 's a very funny and well-crafted movie from start to finish .

1 Of course it is .

1 Seems the most appropriate .

1 I assumed the actors were n't shot together and the three were photoshopped together .

1 I found this movie visually appealing but otherwise I thought it was pretty mediocre . I do n't mind a slow burn , but I thought the film did n't really meet it 's potential .

1 duh its what he 's known for . i hear he was a in a couple cowboy movies a long time ago but apparently they were n't that good .

1 Yes , but you must know the definition to be able to accurately present an example .

1 In my mind Goodfellas will always be the definitive movie that can be watched and enjoyed over and over

1 How exactly do we know what your generation is ? You want us to use the force ?

1 I 'm not a big hearthstone player but having played a lot of magic in the past , I honestly do not see much of a difference as far as the business model goes . You buy packs to get cards . Makes sense . I play enough rank games each time thy release a new card back to get the rank to get the new back . And I have spent maybe 10 bucks on the game . My decks work well and I get the needed rank quickly . I can tell you to get the same level of workable deck in magic I spent a lot more : p .

1 Try either [ Clan of the Cave Bear ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0090848 / ? ref_=fn_al_tt_2 ) or [ Quest for Fire ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0082484 / ? ref_=nv_sr_1 ) . Both have examples of love between Neanderthals and Humans . Not really a la Romeo and Juliet though .

1 I thought Pattinson was amazing . He walked a fine line between under / over acting his characters condition . Truly heartbreaking the way it ended , but I got the sense that he was never meant for that world .

India has 22 * official languages * , [ but the census in 1961 showed we have about 1,652 languages ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Languages_of_India ) , each state has a different language / culture and all that . A movie from that state is most likely their language . Bollywood = hindi Malluwood = Malayalam Tollywood = Telungu Kollywood = Tamil

1 Wow did n't know about the escaped gorilla scene ! I agree I honestly did not see any need for any of these scenes but they were still worth watching because The Goonies is one of my favorite Childhood movies .

1 as a heterosexual male , i can confirm this .

1 Tokyo drift was probably when I reallly got into it . Probably an age thing . But I really liked how it was a self-contained story of the kid , and racing culture in japan , etc . Plus kitagawa keiko was in it .

1 The movie focuses alot more on Olivia Wilde .

1 It 's just a matter of what people are looking for in sci-fi . A lot of people hated the Watchmen because they were expecting one thing and they got something very very different . But it happened to be what I was looking for in a superhero movie . And we take all these preferences and apply them to the movies , calling them good or bad , rather than just applying them to ourselves .

1 The whole of the first * Transformers * movie should have been like those first twenty minutes . The camera follows various military / CIA / insurgent groups who are trying to come to terms with the extraterrestrial robots having their own war for some MacGuffin buried on Earth , coincidentally in Iraq . Cue lots of explosions and `` our missiles are worthless against them ! '' anguish . Optimus Prime 's entire communication with humans extends to `` these guys do n't care about your lives , get out of the way and you might live '' . Et voila ! A brilliant , action-packed Transformers film which takes advantage of every one of Michael Bay 's unique talents ( US military porn , beautiful action , odd comedy ) but does n't get involved in Shia The Beef , tiny dogs humping , or urinating robots .

1 Yup , this is some `` the lizard people run everything '' level of conspiracy bullshit . The entertainment industry makes what sells and apparently that makes them horrible sexists .

1 Great director so far . alright actor . his brother though , is an amazing actor .

1 Lucky for you , the Tokyo lead is back in 7 .

1 That movie might not have straight up jokes , but it is by no means serious , Its absolutely ridiculous . I agree though that Pitt was side splitting

1 The first thing . Imagine Southland Tales meets Speed Racer . That 's pretty much what I 'm expecting .

1 What the heck ? ( pardon my language ) I thought they were great in the movie . I thought one weak performance from a major character in a classic film was Dianne Keaton as Kay in the Godfather . I always thought she was very wooden and I hated how she delivered her lines . I also thought Courtney Love brought down Flynt and Man in the Moon . I do n't know what Milos saw in her .

1 [ The Mummy 1932 ] ( http : / www.movie-list.com / posters / big / zoom / mummy32.jpg ) The concept of hot and cool colors is n't something Hollywood just recently came up with , it 's been common artistic practice for a looong time .

1 I just watched this for the first time on Saturday morning . One of the best of the genre , easily . The opening scene , despite NOT being visual gory , was one of the squirmiest scenes for me ... that face and those audio effects ! ! ! Excellent film ! ! !

1 Dude the machines are just playing on your sympathies

1 Apparently , yes .

1 Holy effing spoilers . But yeah , I think it was a good ending .

1 I do n't remember exactly what happened , but I remember finishing the movie and was confused . I think it was him abruptly having sex with the woman and then the movie finishing .

1 Honestly I loved them all , not exactly the Godfather but a nice sci-fi action flick trilogy People just like bandwagons

1 You mean Hector and the Pursuit of Happiness ( although that 's basically Eat , Pray , Love )

1 well he did porn before that soooo

1 Watched it all the way through . It was a decent primer on film . I 'd use it as a jumping off point for parts of film history you 're interested in learning more about .

1 Never said it 's not fucked up . Robbery and murder are both fucked up , but I 'm not going to call a thief a murderer just because both are fucked up . There are levels of fucked-upedness , and to ignore that is silly . Having sex with a 4 year old is * way more * fucked up than having sex with a 14 year old , despite both being fucked up .

1 MREH ! ! ! ! You got the fire in you , kid !

1 I agree . I recently bought it my Dad for Chrismas on BluRay and he was happy enough just watching the beginning again in HD . Also , it has to have one of the best endings as well .

1 Since he 's been dead five years , that 'd be real fucked up .

1 The BSDs support ext2 which is distinct from but compatible with ext3 . The ext3 ( and apparently ext4 ) driver for Windows is also unmaintained as of more than 2 years ago . In any case , Digital Cinema machines run Linux .

1 I actually really liked The Wolverine because it was slower , more methodical , and with the exception of robo-silver samurai and the train sequence , it kind of felt like Kurosawa making a Wolverine film .

1 Seriously . The Thing is like the perfect horror movie .

1 Its been out for a few years . Nice little short .

1 Guys - charlize Theron Girls - tom hardy .

1 BS . the production quality BLEW the swedish version out of the water , let alone the fact that it is arguable that the american version was truer to the novel ...

1 I could not control myself when watching this scene , I mean I knew what had to come next ... .but wow . Great movie .

1 Lots of people love comic book movies .

1 I 've read that 's only a loose sequel that can stand alone . It helps that watch the others to acustom yourself to the franchise 's mythology and atmosphere though but it is n't a big deal . It 's supposed to be in-between 1-2 but dont take my word for it .

1 star war 's basic story has been mostly taken from kurasawa 's hidden fortress .

1 > How come people like adjusted for inflation numbers ? Because this is the number that the work of every single person financially responsible for the film cares about . If there is a way to determine who 'won ' , this is it . This is the final result of the goal that all those people worked specifically for . The purpose is not to do apples to apples comparisons of the whys and whens . Just apples to apples comparisons of success .

1 Except that was n't what happened . Firstly , the N word was only one charge made against her and that was in 2007 , 6 years ago , not 50 . Second , there are plenty of other charges against her and her business partners . The wedding where they had to dress as slaves , black employees at some restaurants were required to use only the back entrance , black staff had to use one specific bathroom . Reddit ( and most of the internet ) may have latched on to the one specific instance of her using the N word , but there was a lot more to the lawsuit than just that one thing . Here is a rundown on many of the charges , not the most detailed list , but the first one I found with most of them . http : / www.mybs.com / 8994-the-shocking-charges-against-paula-deen-that-you-havent-heard-until-now /

1 Because she can .

1 I 'm assuming you 've not seen Tatum in Foxcatcher ? I went for Nic Cage as he can put in a decent performance ( Adaptation , Leaving Las Vegas etc . ) but because he 's nuts like Busey .

1 No Problem man . I still like you

1 As the character , I agree I would want them to reference this in some way . However , Nolan purposely left out any reference to The Joker out of respect for Ledger 's family .

1 I 'd love to see something similar for the six Star Wars movies ( highlighting : dialogue , light sabre fight , large battle , prominent death ) . Though Eps 1-3 will be probably 98 % dialogue .

1 But hold on a second . This guy is on the internet . He would * never * lie here . Plus he sounds angry and bitter ! That means he 's honest .

1 Depends on how much Dune you want . I prefer the Theatrical as a film its leaner although less coherent if you have n't read Dune or are n't really familiar with it . The extended scenes to me feel out of places and just do n't look as polished compared to the rest , although it fills out the story more .

1 Get used to disappointment .

1 You stopped reading comics in 1973 ?

1 > Could have used a different word than trending Like what ? `` It 's being read by lots of people at once across various social media platforms '' ?

1 And on the bright side , you have one of the best foreign filmmakers nominated for Best Director this year and a newcomer that made a beautiful masterpiece .

1 2 Pitch 2 Perfect .

1 Okay , so I 've watched one of the final drafts of this . It is visually stunning , the imagery and scenery of Indonesia is fantastic , which is why I wish you had made a more interesting title so that this could gather more exposure ( no offense to the title that you already have ) . I personally feel that the direction Hollywood should be taking is reaching out and producing internationally . For several reasons : 1 . We 've seen a shit ton of America . 2 . We have n't seen a shit ton of the rest of the world ( and not a lot of U.S. citizens get to travel out of the country ) . 3 . There are some BEAUTIFUL places out there ( Indonesia being one of them ) . 4 . And production costs are certainly cheaper in some areas than others . These are just a few of a list that could go on and on . But that 's just what I think .

1 And money . And effort . And more money . And god knows how much more money . No thanks .

1 * Fido * ? http : / www.rottentomatoes.com / m / fido /

1 No

1 The cover you see on the store shelves is a throw-away slip . When that 's gone , you have a flat-black sleeve with the movie 's tagline written across it , like the posters with Eisenberg 's face on it . Then you open that and you get the actual case , which has Eisenber on it , and words like `` Punk '' , `` Billionaire '' , `` Genius '' , on his face , and then a ton of photos from behind the scenes . On top of that it just has a nice feel to it , it 's just a gorgeous case .

1 The remake pretty fun too .

1 Raiders is still my favorite , but Short Round cracks me up .

1 He has a lever that instantly changes his costume . What would D. Zoolander give for one of those ?

1 Look at that fat Technicolor camera , it could possibly be easier to move the set around the camera than the camera itself .

1 What the fuck do you even mean ? Are you telling me Prometheus * did n't * show us what a space jockey is ?

1 Awesome . Thanks for sharing !

1 It 's funny because no one in the film knows what the hell is going on either . Fits the 'paranoid ' theme of the 70 's perfectly .

1 Then Lex Luthor switches their buttplug for a kryptonite one and Superman dies .

1 Really ? We just going to throw that out now because a list has Moon in it ? I do n't remember the last highly upvoted post with Coherence and Mr . Nobody in it . Would you rather people just not know about these other movies so that /r/movies can pretend to be some sort of cinema holy ground ?

1 I actually felt that the connections were n't too in your face at all . I mean , sure , they were n't subtle , but they did need attention to be noticed . I also thought that all of the stories focused more on their individual plots than they did on connections .

1 Those are my two favorite movies from both of those directors . Check em out !

1 http : / www.skylightstudiosinc.com These guys do a lot of Boston 's statue work .

1 The difference is that there is a whole new generation of kids that have n't seen it unlike the majority of us . These kids will hopefully be similarly inspired like we were in '93 . A whole new generation of dino-inspired kids . I like the idea of that . It might not blow my mind , but if my kid pees his pants like I did , then the cycle is complete .

1 Haha wow ... Did I say I payed them anything ? Did I defend the movie ? This series of movies is successful because a very large group of people find them entertaining * gasp * . If people like something they will spend money on it , it does n't tend to matter if you , personally , like it or not . I know this is a tough concept to grasp for someone that is as stuck up as you appear to be but if you do n't like a movie then do n't watch it , there may be others that do actually like it .

1 The final scene with the Sentinels walking through the aisle to get Kitty and the Professor was terrifying and heart wrenching . They did n't look like mere machines with a target , but you could feel there was a `` motivation '' behind it , like they were actually `` enjoying '' the moment . Fucking scary .

Strange . It 's not at all what I expected . I feel like I 'll need to watch it again sometime to really come to a strong opinion on it . As it stands I think this was way better than Adventureland , though .

1 Good thing we can pirate windows !

1 > What else do you want from him ? What * more * do you want from him ? FTFY

1 The point is that there 's no proof for either , is there . That 's the irrationality of rationality , it is n't actual empirical truth , its an efficient framework of doing things that leads into the proverbial iron cage . Even Piscine 's memory of the events is at its core a sequence of chemicals in his brain that he is reading in a not necessarily objective way . Memory is n't sancrosanct , this idea of realism is n't either . So the reader is given the option to choose their reality , which probably sounds ridiculous to you but in the confines of the plot it makes a lot of sense to me . You 're too literal , go smoke a bowl or something .

1 Yeah I think the only thing that stopped his performance of Brock from being amazing was those god damn false teeth he could n't talk behind . I thought from the get go , when Thomas Haden Church was cast , that Church would have been Brock as we all know him . Still though , Spider-man 3 was a bit of a mess .

1 Watch the documentary on making 2001 ( on the DVD ) , Kubrick and his team went to extraordinary lengths in doing the science , tech and culture properly for 2001 . The movie itself is a little bit boring but a tour de force in cinema , influencing everything and everybody that came after it .

1 Or at least an idea that Batman and Joker were going to interact for part of the movie .

1 The Life of Brian , moreso for the irony of the last scene given the circumstances you 've presented .

1 Have n't seen it yet , but try watching Drive . Literally every shot - I mean every single second of the film - is blue and orange . Could barely focus on the rest of the movie .

1 Mean Girls is a solid movie . I would n't call it # 1 , but it 's definitely not a joke of a movie .

1 That film relied on me being in the right mood . And I was in the right mood . Which made it absolutely fucking fantastic .

1 Could be from how much attention the film has received in the last month with the Golden Globe win and the Oscar nomination .

1 That 's fine with me , that line just does n't sound natural . Bane 's earlier line sounded fine , so I 'm not really worried . Maybe his mask has a microphone or something .

1 The sequel is the batman superman movie

1 I do n't think they will . I mean , Jack Black wants it to be scary as well . I think it will work in some humor to make the kids calm down after the scarier parts

1 I agree . This kind of goes along with Donnie Darko for me . Depressing but also a little WTF on the first viewing .

1 I love red letter media , but that 's kind of a stupid video . I did n't watch the whole thing , but everything he mentions at the beginning of the video is either meant to be mysterious ( what is the black goo ) and will probably be explained in the sequel ( s ) , makes plenty of sense ( the hologram knew where to look because it is a computer program , do you get confused when a video game character looks out of the screen at you ? ) , or is just typical sci-fi movie logic ( why did they take off their helmets , for that matter why do movie helmets always have lights on the * inside * ? and maybe their suits scan for organic compounds and did n't find any , who knows ) . Also , anyone who ca n't understand why someone would get freaked out after finding a 2000 year old humanoid alien corpse is either socially retarded or being willfully ignorant . If anything , that goes double for a biologist because it flies in the face of everything we know about the nature of life , and it goes triple for a biologist that is high . Many people could n't even handle the sight of a human corpse .

1 All of Lynne Ramsay 's movies are so beautiful !

1 First : Influence . It came from the age of New Hollywood where directors were given a brand new kind of creative freedom . One can look at Mean Streets as one of the defining films of the age in that Scorsese was able to create a film like it , which leads to : The film itself . There really was n't much like it before , at least coming out of Hollywood . It provided a strikingly realistic and personal portrait of living in New York , which was very personal to Scorsese . For this alone the film screams a sort of authenticity that 's valuable on its own . Ultimately I think it 's a great film . It 's light on narrative but its so authentic and personal that it just speaks to me . I can totally understand not enjoying it though .

1 If you read the descriptions you 'd see it mentioned under Lifeboat , I just wanted to focus on a lesser known Hitchcock . I figured there was n't much point in recommending one of the most critically acclaimed movies of all time . Same with Rope .

1 I loved that his hand to hand was kinda not so good . It made him a believable character I rooted for . Like , yeah he 's getting his but kicked because this person is up close , but John just needs one shot to finish it .

1 Speaking as a parent , I hate other parents .

1 I highly suggest you watch the original * The War of the Worlds * ( 1953 ) , and get a bit more context behind the already-released film interpretations of Orson Welles ' radio drama episode * The War of The Worlds * , which is adapted from H.G . Wells ' novel * The War of the Worlds * written in 1898 . After you 've watched that film , and possibly have listened to the original radio episode ( it has an awesome history behind it where people actually thought it was real when they heard it on the radio , and people committed suicide , because they thought aliens were going to destroy the world ) and have read the novel , you 'll understand why producing yet another adaptation is really excessive at this point . Although it 's an excellent and exciting story , it would really need to be adapted in an entirely different way , possibly with a different perspective and / or series of events leading up to a different outcome than the novel and previous movies have used . If this can be done successfully , without ruining the integrity of the original work by H.G . Wells ' , then it could work out . * EDIT ( Forgot to add the movie I 'd like to see remade ) * : As for a movie I 'd like to see remade , * Rebel Without a Cause * would be an awesome film to be remade with the same story for the most part , a respectable cast with their own interpretations of the characters and not necessarily the original actors ' interpretations ( unless the original interpretation is really the only appropriate one ) , taking place in the present-day and having certain details of the story modernized to fit the present-day appropriately .

1 I think 100 on metacritic is an incredible achievement and it probably gets a lot of hate for that , but , it was a solid 9 / 10 movie for me , maybe even more . Loved it .

1 I LOVE LOVE LOVE that he made this on digital . I really want this to be different from BEAUTIFUL DAY , and the few stills from this article have proven that he 's put that tablet to good use .

1 a teaser for a trailer ? now this is new ...

1 You saw the scene correctly but it 's nothing more complicated than a stylized reaction to the visions hes having . If he were to have had the vision and blocked the arrow just that once , people would think 'Wow that 's a bit of pathetic story-telling ' so I think showing him reacting to the vision in the exact same way makes it more believable ? I do n't know , maybe it 's best not to try and find sanity in a movie so full of craziness ?

1 It was an excuse to have the Luddites vs High Tech plot without committing to one side or the other .

1 Oona Chaplin ! She 's Charlie Chaplin 's grand daughter or great grand daughter or some thing .

1 I 'm kind of surprised by all the responses in this thread that discuss her as if she 's a little kid . 11-year-olds , or at least the 11-year-olds I know , are basically at adult level in their capacity for grasping detail and learning skills ; all they lack is experience . I 'm a college teacher who sometimes does talks in elementary schools and I 've found that I can teach anything from my college classes to an 11-year-old . 9 year olds , I have to dumb stuff down ; 11 year olds , I can pretty much throw everything at them .

1 B & W may not have been necessary for the 90s , but it IS necessary when you are trying to make a film for only $ 26K , funded by a bunch of your personal credit cards

1 Your reasoning about lack of peril is why I hated that he pitted Legolas against Bolg . First in Desolation of Smaug because we knew neither of them would die , so it ends in a draw . In the book , Beorn takes him out in the BOFA . This would have worked in the movie since we never saw Beorn in LOTR . But making it Legolas meant it was just an exercise in Super Mario feats of strength .

1 I 'm sorry I ca n't offer the name of the movie , but /r/tipofmytongue would be a better place to go for help .

1 bad movie , but he was still good in it .

1 There 's a few jumpscares here and there . Mostly the movies relies on creepy imagery and psychological issues though . Here 's the ones I can think of , I hope other people will add what I could have possibly missed . I tried to avoid clear spoilers and stay vague enough . - Be prepared at the beginning , when Anthony Hopkins and Ed Norton are talking and Hannibal leaves the room . - There 's a scene where Edward Norton is looking at pictures of the homicides while sitting on the floor . He has a sudden idea int he form of a flash , that could startle you . - Be prepared for a jumpscare when a certain character is glued to a chair . - There 's a scene with a house on fire and a man and a woman talking . Expect a violent , sudden sound in that scene . This is all I can think of on the spot , hope it can help . Mostly the movie is about atmosphere and creepy concepts , but some jumpscares are put here and there .

1 it is not anti-anything . it is one mans story , you take from it what you will

1 The line about growing up and having our old home not feeling like home , until we have our own families , really hit me . That 's scary .

1 This film was meant to be the first in a trilogy ( trilogies being common in Pasolini 's filmography ) based on Dante 's Divine Comedy . Salo was supposed to be the filmic representation of Inferno . When you look at it from that standpoint , the movie would have been poorly done if it * was n't * so drastically brutal in it 's visual representations . The horrors of Inferno often stem from their graphic visuals , and this film needed to be the darkest , and most sadistic thing Pasolini could create in order to contrast it against the other two films .

1 No , he had disabled the auto pilot docking procedure because he did n't trust Dr. Mann . What her and benefit of the doubt are you talking about ?

1 For me it was because Quantum was a 2-hour long chase scene . Almost every scene was Bond chasing someone down or Bond being chased . That and the story that was mashed between the chase scenes was just not that compelling , especially as a follow up to Casino Royale .

1 But she learns . It 's about redemption : )

1 Holy cow , judging by his resume , I 'm tempted to say the latter .

1 I watched it because I heard that there would be blood..

1 What ?

1 Aliens and UFOs and the like are in the public consciousness too , especially in regards to the 50 's when the Crystal Skull was set .

1 > and nor

1 tha ? ks

1 [ This video is basically everything needed to talk about Prometheus . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=-x1YuvUQFJ0 ) Basically , is David an expert in things that have never , ever happened ?

1 Sound Guy , Director of Photography , Production Manager , Make-up artist .

1 Yes . Yes he is !

1 Director 's cut does n't have the voice-over ruining the plot

1 Nice try , Josh .

1 Well what the fuck .

1 Funny , but that was my favorite part of the movie . But then , I 've never really liked Cyclops .

1 The fact that he does n't `` resemble red skull in the slightest '' is probably not the main problem here . He may have other issues ...

1 `` Watchmen '' I absolutely love that movie , I 've watched it so much , I honestly dont have any idea why people dont like it . The acting ? I had no problem with it , The different ending ? I actually thought it was better than the `` Squid '' ending . I got a giant arm tat of Silk Spectre even . People call me down each time i bring up i like this movie , So now i dont even bring it up , even though it has probably made the biggest impact on my psyche .

1 We should probably avoid linking to websites that frequently use reddit as their source .

1 For a Disney film , it 's unpredictable . It also strays from the norms of story telling - no main antagonist , no real hero role and there 's no equilibrium at the start of the movie which gets upset . Sure Anna is like the hero in the film , but she 's really the victim . To add to that , she 's the victim of her sister - who is n't really the bad guy . There 's two other people in it who have cruel intentions - the 'bad guys ' - but they do n't really drive the main plot line . You could still tell the story without them . The film also starts out in a bad place - Elsa 's having a hard time of it from the get go , there 's not this perfect life which becomes threatened . I 'm no massive Disney fan , but I really enjoyed the films dynamics . Not to mention the animation engine - check out the snow physics they created , and the fact the most of it was actually filmed with a guy holding a camera - it 's a technical masterpiece in that respect . I was expecting Disney just go 'hey Pixar - send us a copy of Marionette - we wan na make some cash too ' , but they 've really gone above and beyond with this one . There 's also a lot of effort been put into the character animation , particularly their body language . I think it draws audiences in a lot more . But overall , I think it just hits a sweet spot for all ages of people . My daughter loves the Snowman dude and the old guy with the wig , I like the show tunes ( I 'm not gay , I 'm not gay at all ) and the technical side of the film - and my wife likes anything with Cinderella 's castle at the start .

1 I like Tarantino for what he is . He is a trope-master and loves to play with the toolbox and I love his movies for that . I love the new takes on old concepts and they 're enjoyable . He 's not the best , but he has some movies that rank high up there .

1 Ok take the metal dildo out we are trying that again !

1 No good dinner party ends after dinner .

1 He can squeeze through anything he wants and I 'll be right there to watch .

1 Hmm . I see . I like it . Thanks for some inspiration !

1 Oh I 'm sure we 'd all fuck Perkins .

1 Yes that 's catwoman .

1 I would n't think it 'd be all sex . Movies like this tend to be R rated based on language , but it looks like there 's some action stuff in it too . Tell 'em it 's one of the most monumental movies of the year , because it is .

1 I saw it and immediately assumed it was from /r/nottheonion

1 I do n't like deciding in advance who is or is n't artists . Can you believe Brannagh * remade * Henry Vth ? What a fucking hack that guy is .

1 SEARCH fans , do not lose hope . The negatives are at our Warner Bros . Motion Picture Imaging facility awaiting the remastering process . Your patience will be rewarded !

1 [ Hey Ray , you ever wear one that says `` Undercover '' ? ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / Q107xye.jpg )

1 [ His twitter is still the best ] ( https : / twitter.com / strombone1 / status / 477901313682849792 ) . ( [ or this ] ( https : / twitter.com / strombone1 / status / 465656828698046464 ) )

1 The problem is almost every character in the movie could qualify . Including [ this guy ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=EyH760MV3Yg & feature=related ) .

1 Theres hardly anything adding up in the prequel trilogy ...

1 Ahh , that 's right . Sneaky Frenchman .

1 wow ! That is a sad rate . The movie was fantastic and even called back to the last two movies setting it up for a fourth . Well I for one thought it was awesome and a must see for SCI-fi buffs .

1 Yeah , but this sounds exactly like someone remembering Dreamcatcher from years ago . 'Snake in the toilet ' makes more sense to a confused memory than 'shitweasel in the toilet , ' I would imagine .

1 would n't be perfect otherwise .

1 The real question to me is , is that Gaff in there ?

1 What a load of crap . * The Hobbit * was not a prequel , it was a work of its own , that stood entirely by itself . The quest in the Hobbit is not `` merely a field trip , '' in fact I would argue it was just as lengthy and perilous as any one character 's story in LOTR . And then he complains about the unique ethnic cultures of each of Middle Earth 's different races ? Come on . Then the usual `` does n't warrant a trilogy '' talk , even though it 's filled with backstory that was n't present in the Hobbit , but helps link it to LOTR .

1 It 's a solid three hours and I * loved * it . But I think that it 's a film you should watch in the cinema , because there 's always that temptation to leave or just watch something else . I think it 's weird that I was never bored during the film . It 's got great visuals , cinematography , all of that stuff , and it 's the sort of film where every half hour or so someone looks purposefully into the camera and you do n't know why and then near the second half people start saying the same things and you have no idea what the motifs mean . Anyways I 'd absolutely recommend seeing it if it happens to be playing at an international film festival near you .

1 I remember literally punching the air and cheering when Spartacus reversed Crassus ' reversal . It was so tense because the ending could have gone either way but in that moment I accepted that Spartacus was about to die , but he just keeps on going .

1 Yes , but they tell you when it gets spoilery .

1 Pics or it did n't happen

1 They cut a ton of times I 'm guessing . Just very subtle and cleverly done .

1 - [ House of 1000 Corpses ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0251736 / ) and [ The Devil 's Rejects ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0395584 / ) are both fun . - [ The Descent ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0435625 / ) - I liked the first Scream movie , but you 've probably seen it too many times too . Oh , maybe [ Braindead ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0103873 / ) ?

1 I was hoping to see her in nothing .

1 Yo !

1 I completely agree . I do n't understand why you 're being downvoting for having an opinion , especially one you justify with legitimate criticisms of the movie .

1 Just going to throw this out there but if your father was the president of Yale , you are going to get into Yale no matter what .

1 Wall-e The last half was n't as good as the first half , I wish they would have toned down the human aspect a little bit . But it still ranks as my favorite animated film of all time , and I would also say probably my favorite science fiction film of all time . And definitely the best love story told in a film that I have yet so see . Up would be second best Pixar film , although once again I 'm not a huge fan of the second act . Its a movie of wonderment and beauty , but the ending is kinda telegraphed in and it feels a little too formulaic . Its still absolutely amazing . Third would be The Incredibles . Is it just me , or is the movie unfairly lost between some of the other Pixar movies ? I never felt it was as popular as say Toy Story , Finding Nemo , and Cars were ( Or even Monsters Inc ) . Maybe I just do n't pay enough attention .

1 Welcome to humanity .

1 The last one is `` el crimen del padre Amaro '' .

1 Personally I enjoy having depth perception . Things in the background actually look further away instead of just being blurry

1 Yeah , it 's definitely out . I got it from Tesco and there were loads of copies . Is the States not December 9th ?

1 Fuck ! Fucking wanted it , too , bunch a ' cocksucking motherfuckers .

1 it 's almost as if there 's bias in your decision making

1 `` Almost '' ? What kinda gen-u-ine frontier gibberish is that ? ? It 's * totally * genius !

1 Directed by Gary Whitta .

1 Wait , you liked the Expendables but you did n't like Machete ? What kind of alternate universe are you living in lol

1 what a twist

1 David Kelley , before he showed me the script asked me if I knew who Kurtwood Smith was . I said , `` Yup. We 're friends . '' David Kelley said , `` Good . ''

1 Quvanzhane ( ? ) Wallis was 9 when we was nominated .

1 Well , he 's only got a few minutes . To really dig into a film using the kind of exposition he does would take hours . I think of his videos as a kind of introduction to film criticism , to get people interested who 've never thought about analyzing cinematography .

1 Incredible world-building , and they handled the idea of programs willing to work with humanity a lot better ( if not more surrealistically ) . I feel like The Animatrix universally presented its ideas in better formats than the last two movies .

1 I agree . Comic book movies were on a different level then so at the time it was pretty good .

1 Scary Movie 5 was so fucking bad from the first moment

1 It should be : > Niggaz gettin wasted

1 Kasper included no commas . The phrasing is ambiguous . Interpreted one way , * the others were pretty and all * but * this one made me laugh . * Interpreted another way , * the others were pretty * and * all but this one made me laugh . * See the difference ? Commas are important .

1 90 's definitely .

1 It 's from a [ web series ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / playlist ? list=PL6EC7B047181AD013 ) called DBZ Abridged ( Or TeamFourStar Abridged series , or TFS Abridged , or whatever ) . And yes , it is a comedically dubbed over and condensed version of Dragonball Z . It 's pretty hilarious . It is one of the more popular `` Abridged '' series out there . Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged being one of the earlier and more popular ones that inspired others to do the same with other shows . The DBZ one became one of the most popular of these . I 've only watched the Yu-Gi-Oh and DBZ ones , but I think they are both hilarious .

1 DDL would live in the woods for a year . Shoot all the parts as Adam , get a sex change , shoot all the parts as Eve then turn back into normal DDL . Then he would win an Oscar for both parts .

1 Crumb

1 Hell , I 've got nephews and nieces who think that characters like The Fairy Godmother and The Three Little Pigs come from Shrek .

1 Seminal film making .

1 totally with you on this . I ddnt actually want to see it but my family did . it was n't good but it was enjoyable .

1 Best part .

1 > enlightened for life ! FTFY

1 I believe the Soul Stone can IIRC

1 Ever seen Empire of the Sun ?

1 Uh ... no ?

1 Meh , I liked him as Ted .

1 Ah yes , a dark and gritty movie about a rock monster , rubber band , fireball , and his invisible sister .

1 Merle !

1 Makes me really wonder which tit aimed it for a 12A certificate . This is not a family film , the original was not a family film , there is no hidden market you will be turning away by toning down the screen play , violence , swearing etc . One of the key things about the first film was the brutality . It is about a drug dealing sex traffickers , this followed by a man brutally massacring his way across Paris to get his daughter back . Why would you expect the sequel to such a film to have a clamouring market of children viewers and families who would other wise be excluded ? As you said the audience are teenage males . Its a shame its not getting very good reviews , the first one was awesome .

1 That kinda grossed me out , sorry ! : D

1 Oh , no I totally get why they would use that take . The power of it , that he kept in character , it was a wonderfully delivered speech ... I 'm only surprised because to smear your own blood on a co-worker without permission is a bit forward , and also likely a violation of certain health restrictions . I 'm sure Kerry did n't actually * mind * , especially when the take is so superb and the action added so much to it , but I can easily imagine an actress getting frazzled or very pissed about it . I think it was one of the best scenes of the entire film , up there with the German conversation with Kerry and Chris , and the dog sequence .

1 He was extremely rapey

1 A man overcoming his fears .

1 ... umm

1 Or Duncan Jones . Fuck , let them tag team .

1 The hit was not in accordance to the `` 30 min or less '' Policy here is your money back and I hope this has not discouraged you from any future business .

1 Where are you seeing movies ? I see tons of movies and almost never run into these blatant acts of disruption . Of course I tend to avoid the weekend night showings .

1 Well , I mean you could look at it that way , but ... .no .

1 Brosnan at the top ! BLASPHEMY !

1 I 'm gon na fuck you in the ass

1 Not to mention Alex Turner 's soundtrack is incredible . By far my favorite movie

1 The German accent is horrendous . It sounds so South African .

1 You ca n't be a real fucking person .

1 Germans with their ? ?

1 There is a pretty huge difference between not being right / compatible for one another and having unrealistic expectations / no balance in a relationship . I think the majority of us are complaining about the later .

1 Yeah , but this is different . With Cars 2 , that was rediculous because the original movie was about nascar style racing , so the whole spy thing came out of nowhere . With Despicable Me , well the world was already made for it . I mean , it had 2 mad scientist super villains , so its not hard to believe there 'd be an agency to combat super villains .

1 Because Robert Rodriguez likes her .

1 Snokie

1 Threads , is horrible . Genuinely horrible . I just felt dead inside for about a week after .

1 Of fine goods ?

1 To watch the movie in 3D you will need a 3D HDTV , a 3D Blu-ray player , 3D glasses , and a 3D version of the movie . The movie does not come with glasses .

1 The original letter was n't remotely snotty . It was an honest condemnation of the producer 's over-reaching response to piracy . It was calm , collected , and absent of name calling . Just as the producer over-reached before , this email is blatantly over-reaching , suggesting that the author and his family deserve jail time . And , it 's ranting , fallacious , and full of personal attacks .

1 Yes its on netflix and yes I would at least get a netflix trial to watch it .

1 I , also , feel the need to mention Spaceballs .

1 I was surprised how many redditors were rejecting the film . I did n't have a problem with the apparent 'poor science ' on display ( you know - science fiction allowing for * slight * deviations from reality and all that ) and I found the film to be highly enjoyable all around .

1 Do you have that in English please ?

1 I think it 's just people do n't like what family guy has become . But they still like the older episodes . Cause those are the ones I usually see referenced . It 's kinda like how people shit on new Simpson episodes even though they love the old episodes .

1 1 ) Yeah there is really no room for interpretation . This is exactly what the movie attempted to convey , and I do n't disagree with this . I 'm just saying that it is fucking stupid that an archaeologist , who has spent his life studying ancient civilizations , when presented with ruins of an ancient alien civilization , breaks down into depression and disinterest . 2 ) Archaeologists are absolutely scientists . 3 ) Sure , ok . That does n't mean it is n't stupid . They maybe should have found ways to insert Christian symbolism without making the characters silly and unbelievable . 4 ) Seems perfectly reasonable . It does n't make the `` engineer '' any less one-dimensional or his behavior any less boring . 5 ) Yeah I can get why the atmosphere would be similar . That is n't what I have a problem with . Scientists exploring an alien planet would never ever under any circumstances do this . It is so far beyond ridiculous and uncharacteristic of a team of explorer / scientists . 6 ) Again with 3 ) , why prioritize this symbolism over character believability to such an extent ?

1 Those scenes are showstoppers

1 Ridiculous in some ways , but King is at his best , when writing about characters in the midst of a fracturing situation . Really disappointed that Jackson was n't cast as 'Raggedy Man ' , though I can see there might be a reluctance to perform a part with few lines .

1 Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs - and it 's a great film .

1 Boo for upvoting one guy saying a new movie was terrible with no explanation or reasoning .

1 Vicky Christina Barcelona

1 Write that down .

1 This storyline in the movie was , other parts are set after the first Sin City .

1 That was a terrible not writing that page

1 Infinity Wars parts 1 and 2 have to be some of the biggest hyped and built up movies ever .

1 buff for the roll ? trying to impress dinner pastries ?

1 `` Rushmore '' should be next IMHO

1 I for one look forward to visiting the ruins of the park with the ruins of the lost city

1 This would probably turn civil war from a little more of a transitional movie for infinity wars to a movie that you have to see or be banned from society .

1 So well put ! I have been trying to verbalize why rape horrifies me so much and you just nailed it on the head .

1 because she wants to get back alive ?

1 Why he chose enchilada night , I will never know .

1 I like the inclusion of One Hour Photo in this list . So . Hard . To . Watch .

1 Well he is getting married to someone with a dude 's name . Also Ian McKellen is performing the ceremony .

1 `` i do n't dig on swine '' *

1 Way too obvious that you 're a troll account .

1 As a resident of the Milky Way can I get a shout out for all my dawgs in the Western Spiral Arm ?

1 > Also , it has a metaphysical message of tolerance and karmic responsibility to others that will piss off conservatives and fundamentalists . I really , really , really do n't want to believe that you 're onto something here , but unfortunately I do .

1 You got to get in line behind the Don and diabetes .

1 I 've read on slashfilm that it was indeed in the original script . They even sketched out the alternate timelines and such to make sure it made sense . If he did want to go that route they should have fleshed it out a bit more . It just came out of the blue .

1 I dunno , when I turned the page after all those images of carnage and saw the giant squid , everything I had read previously tumbled together in my mind like a perfect game of Tetris and I found myself blurting OH .

1 Do n't worry , if he dies he 'll just be back in a few months with a new costume .

1 [ Corman produced the first movie Howard directed . ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0076100 / )

1 `` Imagine if you suddenly learned that the people , the places , the moments most important to you were not gone , not dead , but worse , had never been . What kind of hell would that be ? '' I will never forget this line from A Beautiful Mind .

1 my answer to this is always [ The Oily Maniac ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=rtFsIQsFY04 ) . That is a cult classic waiting to be found . If praying Arrow / Scream Factory or any other company like that puts it out on blu ray and it find 's it 's audience . wow even that has 300 votes . I guess the most obscure I can think of is [ Blood Beat ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0088822 / ) which is so bad it 's good , or actually more so bad it 's surreal .

1 He does . In the Casino Royale poster , he starts off looking towards the right , in Quantum of Solace , he 's gradually turned more to the left , and in Skyfall , he 's looking RIGHT AT YOU .

1 I was not scared by that at all . It was more shock value than horror .

1 The Matrix is amazing , and it 's incredibly entertaining . Not hard to finish once you start it like some of the other movies that people insist you watch .

1 I was a little confused - did Melquiades just lie to Tommy Lee Jones about his home town ?

1 That 's a lot of teenage angst in a single post .

1 Incredible ?

1 It is awesome . Love that bit when they are leaving the derelict ship and those metallic spiders are chasing them .

1 Well , damn it , it should .

1 Sony 's hardware devices are probably the only things that they extensively test for security issues . Why would they let you root your phone or play self-published titles ?

1 I refuse to watch this movie because I know it will make me cry like a bitch .

1 I liked The Hunt , it 's a solid drama / thriller , but The Great Beauty was far and away the best nominee in that category in my opinion . I think most people who repeat this line have n't even seen it .

1 Certainly ... . [ OP Delivers ! ] ( http : / imgur.com / a / 610XS ) Note that these images are the best quality I have as I rather stupidly chose to lend it to a friend and of course , it has never been returned .

1 I would much rather watch a `` beginning '' story about John Clark , but something like * Without Remorse * would be kinda hard to put into a film everyone could watch . That book was pretty dark brutal at times .

1 Directors Cut is way better in my opinion , the music scenes are longer , theres more character development , and you see boobies .

1 It 's nothing like saying vaccines cause autism . Talking about `` the wage gap '' in broader terms without pandering to Reddit 's specifications when there is a time limit on your speech has no foreseeable damage as there * is * inequality in all fields , and in Hollywood there * is * a [ wage gap issue ] ( http : / www.independent.co.uk / news / people / hollywood-pay-gap-charlize-theron-negotiated-raise-to-match-chris-hemsworths-10million-deal-reports-say-9972448.html ) in a very direct way ( Charlize Theron is unarguably the `` bigger star '' and is being paid less ) , not to mention the rampant sexism . Whereas in your example , vaccines have no relation whatsoever to Autism and it is damaging to suggest any relation between the two .

1 > I would have looked like a spare prick at a wedding Greatest line .

1 I went into 21 Jump Street not necessarily thinking it would suck , but that it would just be another silly movie . I also thought Channing Tatum would have a hard time pulling off a funny character . I was wrong on both fronts . I do n't usually laugh at movies and stuff , I 'll make mental notes that `` yeah , that was funny '' but it was the most I 've laughed at a movie in years .

1 How do we know it 's Fury 's big week ? !

1 Hrmm . That 's not good . But then again , there 's no way a big studio would release anything close to the original Robocop . The closest I 've seen is the new Dredd .

1 Oh what a day ! * What a lovely day ! *

1 People are just sick of that stale joke about them not existing .

1 It 's confirmed to be a wide release .

1 Came here to post this . 100 % agree .

1 Correct . It * was * considered a lost film , until Reddit found it in 2011 . http : / en.m.wikipedia.org / wiki / Cry_Baby_Lane # Availability

1 Riggan is an unreliable narrator . What he sees and hears is n't necessarily what does happen in the movie . For one thing , he 's alcoholic , perhaps delusional . The flight / action sequence happens right after a night of heavy drinking . The stage light could have been a coincidence that he rationalized as a super power .

1 Another hilarious Affleck gem from that commentary . Kevin Smith is going over the scene and Ben Affleck just flat-out talks over him and goes ( paraphrasing from memory ) : `` My God , you 're firing a GRAPPLING HOOK from your UTILITY belt . This sucks ! ! ! This is retarded . I remember as a young actor thinking * Jesus Christ , I should just kill myself . Get a fuckin ' sack of sleeping pills and just do it . They will just lazily write it into the script the next day . `` Oh , dude who works at Fashionable Male killed himself last night ! Snootchie Bootchies ! ! ! '' *

1 I just think LATRG is n't talked about much , but lots of people ( including me ) love it to pieces just for the concept and Ryan Goslings acting alone .

1 Valhalla Rising is very artsy , but I love it . It was beautifully shot and directed .

1 Why 's there always got to be a dick around here ? A man died ! He killed himself , show some fucking respect instead of criticizing the article

1 The new Fright Night is a seriously underrated movie .

1 I go so far as to say 12 Angry Men is easily my favorite movie of all time .

1 At least you were able to stand in the shower ... Edward Norton had a difficult time

1 Actually Julian Assange does have a pretty weird accent , not as exaggerated as Cumberbatch 's but definitely a bit weird .

1 Say what you want about Moonraker , it 's excellent conversation material

1 I thought the first one was ok . If there was no sequels , it would have been a totally fine typical blockbuster . But the sequels kept ruining it with each movie ... ..

1 `` You do n't understand . I coulda had class . I coulda been a contender . I coulda been somebody , instead of a bum , which is what I am , let 's face it . It was you , Charley . '' Everyone has to watch this movie . If I recall correctly , Marlon Brando popularized the jeans and t-shirt look in this film .

1 `` Now for my Woody Allen impersonation . I 'm a neurotic nerd who likes to sleep with little girls . ''

1 Dunno why this was downvoted . Herzog often creates fictional moments in his documentaries and real ones in his fictional movies . It 's one of his defining traits .

1 The airports with direct flights to California .

1 It got turned into District 9 . If you watch the live action Halo 3 short film promo you can see the similarities in how the filming and CGI were done . I think Peter Jackson even had a hand in making the promo .

1 I see your point but that does n't make Eisenberg the right choice . Luthor is intimidating and ruthless and they will have to force that with Eisenberg because he is neither of those things . He does not command attention when walks into room and I ca n't see that being the case no matter how different he acts in this movie from his others .

1 You make it sound like there 's no work to be done before you start filiming .

1 If Imogen Poots and Benedict Cumberbatch were both headlining a movie poster , it would implode from the sheer Britishness of it .

1 What the fuck are you talking about ?

1 I was horrified by the face peeling maggot meat scene as a kid . And oh , god that clown - right there with you . I ca n't wait till my 8 year old gets to see this ... .

1 And any swearing that 's bleeped out can be a running gag where he asks the audience if they heard it too .

1 Nice ! That 's an interesting factoid - the origin of it , I mean .

1 The tears in his eyes when he turns back to look at his friends..so good !

1 South Park has shown some very intense scissoring scenes ...

1 That 's what kept it for me . We had n't gotten to Gary Oldman 's voiceover from the trailer `` All clothing is custom , nothing in his pockets but knives and lint '' , so I knew that he was still alive .

1 Me too ! And donated a few bucks , really puts you life into perspective . This video should be at the top .

1 You might be cursed , haunted , or in a horror movie ... I 'd ... uhhh ... yea , I 'd look into that for your own safety .

1 It might be in order for someone to get their affairs in order ? Just a guess , not really sure .

1 I AM THE ONE WHO KNOCKS , GODDAMNIT .

1 It 's not even worth pirating anymore .

1 I love that gif omg , he asks the question like he truly does n't know the answer , and then answers it with a face that says `` I bet you did n't expect that plot twist , look at your face you had no freaking idea I was going to BLOW YOUR MIND ''

1 I have no idea , but watching both Labor Day and Men , Women , & Children almost make me hate Reitman as a director . He had such a flawless record ( I love Young Adult , although many think it was the start of a decline . )

1 A script he wrote , but was directed and acted badly . He also worked on Toy Story > . >

1 This . Shia is a dick on and off screen , while not having earned the respect of those in the DDL category . He 's a chump punk kid who thinks he 's God .

1 I 'm sure being able to work with Steve Carrell had something to do with it as well .

1 Holy shit , you 're right . Real life Schwarzenegger would win against every single role he played in cinema .

1 I know what you 're saying , and I sympathize . But the cynic in me wonders if the same could n't be said about any war movie . Terms like `` real * ism * `` and `` real * istic * `` contain within themselves an acknowledgment of their subject 's fictional status . Perhaps the real sin here is that HL actually got close enough to make those deviations from reality stand out all the more . I do n't know . I do know that when that spate of Vietnam movies first came out ( Platoon , etc ) , my uncle , a Vietnam war vet , was only really affected by The Killing Fields - a movie which dealt the least with the conflict and the most with the people of the region who were affected , in part , by it . I took this as an acknowledgment of the fact that no film can really capture * war * , but they can do a pretty good job sometimes of dealing with & reflecting the emotional impact .

1 or was it `` should have taken the money , toombs.. ''

1 `` It was a good one ! ''

1 Why ? He has a point . Nolan is a famous filmmaker . He is not a victim , or at least nowhere near the extent of those innocent people gunned down while watching his movie .

1 Bond is , but this list is unadjusted for Inflation .

1 Gladiator was absolutely Russell Crowe 's best work

1 Ditto ... .The movie left me with a big WTF face all over . AND that ending ... .what and why the absolute fuck ?

1 Here is my list : 11 . Ray Park 10 . Ray Park 9 . Ray Park 8 . Ray Park 7 . Ray Park 6 . Ray Park 5 . Ray Park 4 . Ray Park 3 . Ray Park 2 . Ray Park 1 . Darth Maul

1 He 's terrible at accents , but I think he 's a pretty solid actor . Jai Courtney though , I 'm not a huge fan of . Although I thought his stiff , bland acting was kind of perfect for his character in Jack Reacher .

1 ... Almost .

1 For the people like me who Ctrl+F / searched for 'polish movie ' before replying , the above is the post to upvote .

1 Mine too , much better than X-Men III

1 Yeah and maybe there can be some marketing so it 's an actual success . Dredd was way underserved when it was in theatres .

1 But that 'd mean they 'd have to figure out a way to retcon them into the MCU .

1 [ the young ones ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / The_Young_Ones_ % 28TV_series % 29 )

1 I kinda liked the bloat . It never strayed too far and it almost always related back to the main story line . Remember that its a TV show not a movie , so we ca n't ( do n't want to ) remain focused simply on the main story . Besides , it was n't the viewership that caused the cancellation , it was the short sighted execs that only cared about numbers and money instead of making a good show .

1 If you can cover shipping cost then they 're yours . Medium sized box flat rate priority shipping cost like $ 13 . If you can cover that , then they 're yours . Unless you live in Las Vegas or have someone that lives in Las Vegas that wants to pick these up from me then they 're free .

1 [ Magical Negro ? ] ( http : / tvtropes.org / pmwiki / pmwiki.php / Main / MagicalNegro )

1 It 's not true , da_fuhje is a serial bullshitter

1 Unique Batman ? He was THE fucking Batman . Also , he was Batman with a personality . As much as I love Dark Knight 's cold and precise version of the B-Man world ... it was so much more fun and original with Burton and Keaton behind the wheel .

1 Pretty sure we all read it that way .

1 > That seems incredibly plausible . It does , but that 's not the story I 've ever read . It 's always been parts of the story told at different times . But it does n't really matter . Maybe he 's a grump . Maybe there are religious grounds . Maybe it was just a movie to him , and while the friendships are wonderful that does n't mean he wants a tattoo . Maybe a dozen other reasons . At any rate , I do n't care why Salah did n't get a LOTR tattoo . I 'm just glad he has been a huge part of movies during my life .

1 American History X , final scene .

1 Strong opinion .

1 If you go by past movies with CGI raccoons , and past wonder woman movies , the CGI raccoon is truly the safe bet .

1 I think it was more about what we * can * accomplish than about the mistakes we had already made . Which was the reason for the focus on * `` them '' * being super advanced humans instead of aliens . It was also , I think , the reason that the politics of what caused the wars and the environmental collapse were n't really in the spotlight ( it was more of just a matter-of-fact , like , `` yeah , they happened , what 's next . '' )

1 Excellent !

1 I always liked him in the RomComs he was in , they were fun films . Never thought he would take off like he did but I 'm glad he has , True Detective is my favorite thing he has ever done as far as his acting goes .

1 Or the Lady Macbeth ... * Is this a dagger I see before me ? The handle towards my hand ? Come , let me clutch thee ! *

1 Oh absolutely . You * do * understand that I did n't make that title , right ? It 's just the article TV Tropes has on the phenomenon ( and many examples they list are from before Colbert , he 's just the one that most famously named the act ) .

1 Have n't seen it , but I 'm gon na . Have to if it involves the Cage .

1 I know it 's fuckin ' good . I 'm the one who buys it . When Bonnie goes shopping , she buys shit . I buy the good stuff cuz I like to taste it .

1 In a similar sense , The Wind that Shakes the Barley .

1 Yeah , I can easily turn my brain off to believe we 'd be anywhere near the metallurgic capabilities to build one of those robots in seven years . I ca n't turn it off to believe that they 'd choose the operator of such a device with stick fights .

1 It 's not like the phases really matter for anything but a special edition box set

1 In Team America Matt Damon KILLS IT !

1 That 's what I initially thought but no , that kid was not an orphan .

1 Sorry , but my heart is three sizes too small for your pandering to be effective .

1 I think there is a Titanic 2

1 THE BIG GREEN THO. Anecdote : the high school I eventually went to was being built when that movie came out , and the whole area was just a big patch of grass . They had goats grazing on it to thin the growth . I wanted so badly for the school 's team to be called the Big Green , and for their mascot to be a goat . Alas , we were the Knights .

1 Spoiler alert : Maleficent is a fairy .

1 Yes but he wrinkled it * more * Like a scrunchie

1 It really does get better every time you see it .

1 Spun had a happy ending . He got to sleep .

1 `` The Driver wearing a mask was our way to show that The Driver has completed his own transformation into becoming his own superhero . The movie , if you think about it , is about a man who transforms himself into a superhero and fights the bad guys , and superheroes need their own costume . The mask is his . '' From an interview with Nicolas Winding Refn .

1 Easily the best one

1 Yes

1 beyonce 's waiting for that casting call

1 Form Blazing Boner .

1 This .

1 It 's the same one from Episode VI . It is Vader 's flagship .

1 What hump ?

1 It is

1 It depends on how much of the movie 's merit is invested in the twist ending . For a director like Shyamalan , who seems to live off the `` woah '' factor , making predictable films is certainly not a good thing . It always depends on the movie 's intention and it 's reliance on said twist .

1 A lot of people complain about how it goes from day to night so suddenly , but I honestly didnt care because that scene looked so good

1 The Descendants had a few Asian characters and the original story was written by a local Hawaiian women . The Descendants also showed contemporary Island life far more realistically than almost all other movies . EDIT : On IMDB the top 15 actors in Aloha , 14 are white and 1 is black . For the Descendants 9 are white , while 6 are Hawaiian or Asian including the movies author Kaui Hemmings and local TV reporter Kim Gennaula . For 50 First Dates had 10 white people , 4 Asian or Hawaiian and Maya Rudolph . This movie did offend local Hawaiian groups due to Rob Schneider played a Hawaiian / Pacific Islander . For Forgetting Sarah Marshall had 11 white people , 1 black person and 3 Hawaiians , but no Asians

1 133 minutes . The playground fight / meet-cute is still there , but the `` lay her down by the fire '' scene was mandated by Fox and added in reshoots .

1 Then people would wonder where to find the first seven movies in the Hateful series . Which is n't a thing .

1 There were old production stills and the original script .

1 You know it 's a quote from Batman Begins , yeah ?

1 > In brief , forms are not empty because of emptiness , forms themselves are empty . Emptiness means not that a phenomena is empty of being some other object but that it itself is empty of its own inherent existence . That a form is emptiness means that the final nature of a form is its natural lack of inherent existence ; because forms are dependent-arisings , they are empty of an independent self-powered entity . That emptiness is form means that this natural lack of inherent existence -- which is the absence of a self-powered principle -- makes possible the forms which are its sport or which are established from it in dependence upon conditions . Since forms are the bases of emptiness , emptiness is form ; forms appear as like reflections of emptiness .

1 It 's not a remake , it was a new adaptation of a comic - not an overly original plot no , but follow the conversation and you 'll see they were not suggesting it was anyway .

1 While I agree with you , I think you are missing the Tony Stark / Iron Man relationship . Remember when he said `` I AM Iron Man '' ? Yeah , pretty much says it all . In Iron Man 1 / 2 and The Avengers he is confident , and cocky . Not at all emotionally disturbed . This one , he is messed up , hence , Iron Man is as well .

1 It 's the lips , too . That 's what freaked me the fuck out in the trailer .

1 I feel Raising Arizona is one of the Coen Bros. crowning achievements , and i 've seen them all . Everything about it is great : the blocking , dialog . The first 5 minutes / intro is probably some of the best in comedic film history ... .

1 I imagine you will if you are condescending or do n't go into detail [ rightfully so ] when you do it . But that opinion is part of the general consensus here on the sub .

1 but The Shins tho .

1 This just sounds like a recipe for a room full of angry drunks

1 It 's pretty awesome and frightening when you have a realization like that . Good job on being able to face it . Good luck to you .

1 To each their own , but ... you 're just wrong .

1 I knew it was n't going to win , but I was rooting so hard for it .

1 Hell , Tokyo , Osaka , and Kyoto were all sunk if I remember correctly .

1 I actually really like that movie .

1 Yeah , 59 % on Rotten Tomatoes and 56 from Metacritic . Critics loved it

1 Titan A.E . wow ... thanks for that moment of nostalgia : - )

1 Was Sortil ? ge real or just part of Doc 's imagination ?

1 Another favourite of mine would have to be * `` For Your Thighs Only '' *

1 Paul Verhoeven has a special place in my heart for making `` action '' movies that are far too visceral even for being action movies . People looking for a cheap popcorn flick on Netflix and picking Robocop ? Scarred for life . That 's what helps it , Total Recall ( the first one ) , and Starship Troopers stand the test of time . He said `` oh , you want violence ? I 'll give you violence '' , and made some great movies with that `` careful what you wish for '' attitude . EDIT : I completely forgot that I am now also forced to say `` Robocop ( the first one ) '' . Damn it Hollywood .

1 You should find out what version of the DVD you have , because I personally checked my copy , and there was no director 's commentary .

1 What 's funny is we all think of The Godfather 1 & 2 as well as Apocalypse Now when it comes to Coppola . But The Conversation is wonderful as well .

1 ... What ?

1 have the marketing people make all the decisions .

1 Because Aquaman blows .

1 7 movies in and they are making more money than they did when the series first started ... it 's not going to die . AND they 're fun movies , and people enjoy them . Seems like win-win to me .

1 it 's hysterical

1 Galifinakis has done his fair share of awkward pauses with no punchlines as well ( in his standup , at least ) . See also : Andy Kaufman 's reading of `` The Great Gatsby '' * agreeing *

1 I 'd have to go with Star Trek , Doctor Who , and Sherlock Holmes .

1 Sounds good to me

1 It 's not like Pixar is making the same movie over and over again ...

1 To be honest with you I have n't watched it for sometime , but hey , if you think it 's beautiful , then you bet your ass that it is ! I 'll have to watch it and get back to you . And I promise I will ! I just turned it on !

1 I really think the fish means us humans are being controlled in every form of way in earth . Because when you see the movie with comentariees at the end when he breaks through the glass the writer said the fish is out of the bowl ... .I linked it to when Damon placed the fish back in the water symboiling that we are controlled and that we only breath on water , water being the material world ... I actually think the fish was dead but brought back to life in the water . Kind of like the matrix when neo saw the world in codes . We are blindly stuck on a bowl that we ca n't get out of no matter how bad we want to .

1 Yep , you got me . * heads back to the movie set *

1 What ? No . An alien come crashing from earth after its home planet is doomed . He grows up as an earthling and learns to defend his omg ... you 're right .

1 It does n't have much if anything to do with physical cheating , and it 's not seen as `` constituting cheating physically '' , but it 's still seen as as much of or even more of a betrayal by many .

1 By the looks of it , it 's porcelain glued onto the teeth , not dentures .

1 They really just made the plot boring . They put a whole bunch of silly characters in , and that really just fucked with the pacing of the story . Having a massive star fleet surround a planet is a pretty exciting plot point in itself , it was just so poorly played out .

1 This is amazing . I 'm currently in a college program that touches on visual effects and I was very happy with the video .

1 Holy shit : * Space Opera * The Wachowskis * Sean Bean does Han Solo I 'm neutral about the leads but overall this looks great , although to be fair I 'm a big sucker for the genre . I 'm a giant Star Wars fan and The Fifth Element is one of my favorite movies . This reminds me a lot of Mass Effect too from the looks of it . If the leads hold up this could be awesome and I really hope it becomes a franchise .

1 When I think of classic cinema , I definitely tend to think a little bit past the 1980s .

1 That does n't mean that Will was n't great .

1 When I was in San Antonio , I saw Zero Dark Thirty . The theater was packed with Navy and Army . I went with a group of friends who are a part of this crowd . One of them sat at attention before and during the movie . Another said he hated the movie and called it a waste of time . Some guy in the crowd yelled AMERICA THE FREE , HOME OF THE BRAVE after it ended . Another guy said he loved the movie . It was a strange thing seeing a crowd so polarized by what they had just seen .

1 Wrong . People go to the movies to watch a movie . Not to watch some asshat fiddling with their phone next to them . That 's why theaters have big screens , stadium seating , surround sound systems , and dark rooms ... so you can become engrossed in the movie experience instead of being distracted by what is around you . People pay money for that experience , and you are detracting from it by flashing your bright-ass screen around because you think you are too important to keep it in your pocket for two hours .

1 I feel like Seinfeld is fairly accurate where other TV shows or movies tend not to be . I regularly see people complaining about characters never saying goodbye on the phone , or going to the toilet , and Seinfeld has both of these things .

1 While the CGI was ahead of its time , they also relied heavily on animatronics . The CGI itself looks dated . Still wish more movies were made this way .

1 I saw this in the theater and loved it . Just how Daft Punk and their Tron Legacy soundtrack gave life to the movie , The Chemical Brothers do the same for Hanna . When it gets too noisy at work , I throw on either of those soundtracks and jam out code . As for flying under the radar , I do n't recall that it was ever advertised much , if at all . Wikipedia puts its budget at 30 million . Few theaters here in NYC were showing it and those that did only had it for maybe 2 weeks .

1 When he says this century , I think he 's referring to 2000 and forward , so WWII would not count into that . Either way , this seems like a complete disaster , which might be for the best in the long run . Time will tell .

1 They kept the ship in orbit to match earth time , but they wanted to rule out the planet first because it was the most promising AKA it had liquid water . And since the signal was positive , it really was a viable option . The plan was to touch down , evaluate , and leave before too much time had slipped . The could wait for Dr . Brand in the Endurance at un-dilated time . Assuming the enormous tidal waves did n't exist , it should have been a fine planet to colonize .

1 Nope , I just do n't like psychotic little sadists .

1 Dead on .

1 Paul Giamatti- Private Parts and John Adams . IMO Giamatti is criminally underrated . In Private Parts ( breakout role I think ) plays the scumbag weasly corporate asshole to a T . In John Adams miniseries Giamatti brings the second President of the US to life on screen . You probably only need this miniseries to see Giamatti 's acting skill .

1 Fantastic Mr. Fox and Where The Wild Things Are were good though .

1 He plays dual roles pretty well .

1 You only get to see Issac with his mask on during the opening shot Cut to completely horrendous cg crane shot that zooms out while spiraling away from Issac ( Now in 3-D ! ) , slowly the viewer realizes Issac is in Jamaica ...

But since he was under 30 during filming but 30 when the film was released and shot him to fame , he 's another one I was iffy about . I use 30 as such a sharp cutoff not just because people see it that way in real life ( you 're a * real * adult now ! ) but because there are so many actresses who have attained fame before that mark , like Anne Hathaway , Natalie Portman ( though they 're both now over 30 ) , and Scarlett Johansson , who is still under 30 despite how long she 's been in the spotlight . Which makes me realize , if Jennifer Lawrence plays her cards right , which she has so far , she could have a * long * career .

1 Taking personal responsibility for the people in your world is not , in my opinion , `` military mentality nonsense '' and need not have anything to do with the military at all . In the book , military service was a the simple metric by which one could demonstrate that commitment . It is a thought experiment . It need not translate directly into the real world to be of value .

1 I meant the thread to allow people who may have only heard of * American Beauty * to be exposed to some brighter points of cinema . Personally , if I had a friend who said he / she was really into that film , I 'd like to think they would be blown away by `` the beauty '' of * Safe * .

1 I watched it recently and one interesting point is that back then , it seems , there was an actual point in rehabilitating people in the penal / prison system . Now it 's just commonly accepted to lock them up and throw away the key .

1 As a screenwriter , I felt the whole thing was really well written ... except I did n't laugh . It was frustrating !

1 Mud has really great performances and I love the backdrop of the Mighty Mississippi losing most of its might in the modern day South . Mud is kind of like a 21st century Huck Finn / Tom Sawyer story . The movie was blown out of the Mississippi water by Before Midnight , however . But it 's a great film and a reminder that the transition from childhood to adulthood is scary , confusing and painful

1 A lot of people including myself who had pokemon as kids do not remember it as fondly as others and instead remember it as those stupid games that we all enjoyed back then . In fact I believe the majority of kids our age in America feel this way about Pokemon and do n't really care about it anymore .

1 Upvote for watching the movie correctly .

1 The best character ever in my all time favourite movie .

1 It insists upon itself .

1 The books are amazing . Movie on the other hand , not so much .

1 Yeah , me too . You watch the trailer and you expect a bloodbath , but nope . Shows you how you can still make a film scary without death .

1 I went into the movie unfortunately knowing that there was supposed to be some big plot twist . However , I got so wrapped up in the movie that I forgot all about it until it happened .

1 Not actually D-Day . It 's the evacuation of Dunkirk .

1 It 's a reference to Dredd .

1 I 'd have to disagree , having only been introduced to it by the latest movie , would have never have bought the books or started watching the original .

1 Hard to top the Heston film . I remember going to an old , OOOOOLD theater to see it in Cincinnati , was torn down about over a decade ago , had an organ for the intermissions and everything .

Absolutely brilliant film . > amazingly dense world-building This is something I had n't really picked up on first time , but there 's so many snippets of unexplained conversation that made me want to learn so much more from the film . I read the book it was based on , but the film is far superior

1 For me it 's not about ruining the sequels , but it just seems like there 's no need for another Avatar ... Or two . I 'm not excited for them . I 'd rather see Cameron take on a different movie . Am I alone here ?

1 Tarantino definitely showed that guy where his place is . If you get a signal that a question is inappropriate and still keep pushing it , it 's what you deserve .

1 Turner would have to give up the rights to it , first . That might make things a little bit iffy , especially because the relationship between Genndy and Turner got really ugly after Sym-Bionic Titan was canceled .

1 i thought everyone loved Mean Girls .

1 Omg the sheet scene from PA3 ... Freaky ... That fan was brilliant .

1 I tend to agree

1 I think the crux of the problem is studio 's reluctance to embrace digital distribution . The consumers want it , but studio bosses are not convinced of it . They look at Steam and calmly shrug it off as a children 's plaything . We can look at Netflix 's spotty library as a easy example : it 's not great but consumers WANT it to be great . I suspect it will change in time but Hollywood is afraid of killing their DVD / Bluray cash cow . I 'd bet my mortgage on it .

1 I 'd say one clear difference in their styles is how they present their characters . Kubrick used characters as placeholder for which the audience can insert themselves into his movies . Kubrick 's characters tend to show very little emotion , have very little personality and mostly serve as a blank canvas onto which the viewer can project their own personalities . Nearly all of Kubrick 's films feature very subdued acting , Alex in A Clockwork Orange and Jack in the latter part of The Shining are exceptions - I do n't think Kubrick really wanted the audience to identify wholeheartedly with these characters . Anderson 's characters , however , are rich with personality and emotion . One character might be wildly different than the next . The greatest exception to this might be There Will Be Blood , simply because the character of Daniel Plainview is himself quite stoic and reserved . On a similar subject , however , I think that Anderson is drifting more toward theme-based films than his early character based films . Boogie Nights , Magnolia , and Punch Drunk Love are very character based , whereas TWWB and The Master seemed more theme driven . I would say that most of Kubrick 's films were much more theme driven than character driven , perhaps with exception of A Clockwork Orange .

1 I ca n't believe that lost the oscar to Dances with Wolves

1 This is the ontological paradox , and is one of the major issues with a universe where time travel is possible . Robert Heinlein 's `` All You Zombies '' is obviously one of the major inspirations for this movie and was mentioned earlier in the thread , but `` By His Bootstraps '' is another Heinlein short story that explores this idea . Basically , the ability to send things into the past creates the possibility of entities or information whose timelines are closed loops , which appear `` out of nowhere '' when you look at the timeline . Edit : Yes , this is a little different from the grandfather paradox , which I guess is what you meant by `` standard '' . In that scenario you change the past so that you can not exist anymore . The `` answer '' to the grandfather paradox is to say the past is immutable : you ca n't change the timeline because anything you would do to change it is in the past and already happened and it was that way all along . Under those conditions , the grandfather paradox becomes moot , but you can get bootstrap paradoxes instead . Futurama did this with the Roswell episode : Fry killed his supposed grandpa , then discovered he was his own grandpa all along ( bootstrap paradox : where did his timeline start ? His birth depended on his own existence to impregnate his grandma ) .

1 Yeah , I decided to focus on fictional characters in movies . If anyone wants to see the positions of Bobby Fischer , there are a [ ton of videos ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / playlist ? list=PL9JCz2Gsbqe6SHLYX3WIpYHcaqVSpc7eK ) already on them with much better commentary than I could come up with .

1 On a related note , Ghostbusters was originally conceived as an Aykroyd / Belushi project . It was n't until John died that it turned into what we know and love today . Aykroyd has since referred to Slimer as being the `` ghost of John Belushi . '' Related related note : There was also an early incarnation of Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas that was to star Aykroyd and Belushi as Duke and Gonzo .

1 I kind of feel like this movie just has two antagonists .

1 Jesus , did nobody actually watch the original film ? Campy was never the intention . A tiny budget and non professional actors are the cause of any camp present . The sequels took that and ran with it .

1 Most Fincher 's movies has cold opens . It 's just that the title credits in Gone Girl went too fast that you ca n't even read each of the names flashed . Its title credits is not the stylistic ones like in Dragon Tattoo , or Fight Club , but more similar to the one in The Social Network .

1 I 'm ashamed that I did n't think about writing that . Hobey ho !

1 Both kill bills .

1 Probably Jim Carrey . He 's not a fan of doing sequels , having only previously done a sequel to Ace Ventura . Someone must have convinced him to do it .

1 I totally agree . It really did feel like a fan film . The new stories had such forced writing . That Yellow Bastard did not need to be continued , `` An old man dies , a young girl lives . '' That 's perfect closure . Also really agree with you on Benicio Del Toro . He was a nobody in the comic , but Del Toro really stole the show , especially in the scene Quentin Tarantino directed .

1 Unquestionably * Lolita * .

1 The question is how much of SHIELD was destroyed . Did Fury and the government shut them down completely ? There was more to SHIELD than the Triskelion and the Helicarriers . There 's other bases including the Hub . They even said that Fury was a station chief . Thousands of people working for SHIELD and not all of the rats went down with the ship . Edit : Although I guess the scenes of people going to work for the FBI , CIA and Tony Stark does seem to imply SHIELD was disbanded .

1 Agreed . Over the years , I have become more amiable . In my defense , at that time I lived in a weird neighborhood and people were asking me all sorts of strange things . So , I had to get used to ignoring people . For example , and this is NOT a joke , earlier in the week , a woman with dwarfism asked me to `` throw her son up '' onto a second story porch . There was no way I was going to toss her tiny , little son or daughter onto a porch . So , instead I suggested that she call a locksmith or her landlord to get a spare key . When you live in a place where you 're constantly being asked by strangers for money and weird favors , you kind of have to shut it all out . The truth is that I 'm pretty sure that the women never had any shoes on her feet and the theater should have stopped the movie and had paramedics who are trained in extracting people properly to do the job .

1 Nonsense , he gets his mother to do all his work !

1 The first one attempts to be a more traditional horror movie with a lot of cheese due to the lack of budget and them just overall not taking themselves too seriously . The sequel which is also kinda sorta a remake ( you could edit the two together to make one long film ) is more of a horror movie with comedic moments and is intentionally over the top . The third is fantasy comedy with some horror moments . This looks like it 's in the spirit of the first film but with a better budget and some homages to the second .

1 The series should have gone in this direction ( The Animatrix ) rather than Revolutions , etc .

1 Thank you , Donny .

1 Good question , and sure I 'll try to explain what I mean . I rarely ever see characters in fiction created so they MUST be one race or another . Many classic comic characters can be adapted with any number of racial backgrounds and it would fit their basic origin story just fine ( marketing a drastic change to the audience would be a different story , of course ) . There are some exceptions that come to mind though . T'Challa and Storm are two characters who , I think you 'll agree , are quite fundamentally African . That 's the crux of their origin stories . It 's where they 're from and undoubtedly an integral part of who they are . This captures the gist of what I mean when I say being a certain race ( or you could use something like religion in Daredevil 's case ) is `` fundamental '' to a character 's background .

1 He talked a lot about bad characters , so I think that 's why he uses The Avengers as such a positive example of blockbusters today , because it has likable characters so you care about what happens to them in the destruction porn . Plus , they are n't just trying to survive , they 're trying to save others , so it 's more interesting than the old disaster movies where people were just trying to not die . He also talked about movies doing something new and the MCU is the first series to be as full of crossovers and stuff as it is . While Age of Ultron is sure to be jam-packed with action ( against more faceless goons , no less ) , it also promises to be more emotional than the first Avengers movie and one of the darker movies in the series . Whedon also said he included Quicksilver , Scarlet Witch , and Vision because they do n't just punch things . So their action is sure to be more creative than , say , Hulk 's .

1 Well i know Matts character is Will Hunting

1 None of that is correct .

1 Drive seems to be a pretty polarizing film , especially on Reddit .

1 Dude chill the fuck out . You brought up the remake just to bitch about it .

1 That 's from a lot of things . [ There 's a trope for that . ] ( http : / tvtropes.org / pmwiki / pmwiki.php / Main / SpotTheImposter )

1 Ahem . Rick : Last night we said a great many things . You said I was to do the thinking for both of us . Well , I 've done a lot of it since then , and it all adds up to one thing : you 're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong . Ilsa : But , Richard , no , I ... I ... Rick : Now , you 've got to listen to me ! You have any idea what you 'd have to look forward to if you stayed here ? Nine chances out of ten , we 'd both wind up in a concentration camp . Is n't that true , Louie ? Captain Renault : I 'm afraid Major Strasser would insist . Ilsa : You 're saying this only to make me go . Rick : I 'm saying it because it 's true . Inside of us , we both know you belong with Victor . You 're part of his work , the thing that keeps him going . If that plane leaves the ground and you 're not with him , you 'll regret it . Maybe not today . Maybe not tomorrow , but soon and for the rest of your life . Ilsa : But what about us ? Rick : We 'll always have Paris . We did n't have , we , we lost it until you came to Casablanca . We got it back last night . Ilsa : When I said I would never leave you . Rick : And you never will . But I 've got a job to do , too . Where I 'm going , you ca n't follow . What I 've got to do , you ca n't be any part of . Ilsa , I 'm no good at being noble , but it does n't take much to see that the problems of three little people do n't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world . Someday you 'll understand that . [ Ilsa lowers her head and begins to cry ] Rick : Now , now ... [ Rick gently places his hand under her chin and raises it so their eyes meet ] Rick : Here 's looking at you kid . It 's not one line and it 's copypasta 'd , but if we 're talking about Casablanca * it is the correct answer * .

1 Suddenly , box office records are shattered upon the movie 's release .

1 Prob and stats started of so easy

1 I love Pitch Perfect . It 's the perfect get-me-up film whenever I feel down .

1 This made me smile . He 's really awesome : )

1 That 's the mark of a good film . Emotion . When a film makes you feel something , that 's when it 's really special . The final race in Speed Racer , the Outer Space sequence in Wall-E , the Final Showdown of The Avengers , the First Returning fight for James in Cinderella Man , Gandalf 's return to Helm 's Deep in the Twp Towers , the list goes on and on . But they all made me feel such emotion , and that 's why I love movies . I hope 2014 brings the feels , and we 're off to a good start .

1 Moves straight from the Kevin Bacon Dance Rehearsal ...

1 Not Dark Horse . DC 's Vertigo imprint .

1 I do n't hate them , I 've just never seen them and do n't plan to .

1 people flipped their shit when Heimdall was black though dumb people , sure , but there was still outrage personally I ca n't imagine complaining about Idris Elba being in a movie . dude is talented and versatile ( and hot as hell )

1 everyone should see this .

1 Or this one could be part prison movie . Tatum and Hill have to infiltrate some prison gang doing some illegal hoohah . I can just see the joy on Ice Cubes face as he says something along the lines if `` y'all two assholes are going to prison ! Do n't drop the soap bitches ! ''

1 I love the all the symmetry when the aspect ratio switches to 4:3 . Really love Wes ' style . The visuals alone with the colors and costumes and composition are so quirky it adds a whole new aspect to the film .

1 Yes , it is called that , but it is also referred to as the day people pay tribute to those who have passed away with a gesture . My dad and mom light a candle for their respective fathers each Nov 1st .

1 I think they are actually taking the story from the stage production `` Wizard of Oz '' ( not to be confused with the book Wonderful Wizard of Oz ) . You do know there are quite a few conical books about Oz ... right ?

1 I bet Hayden Christiansen would have done a somewhat decent job if the writing was a bit better .

1 Yep . It gave us a Nightcall , leaving us , Under a Spell .

1 It 's a pretty odious movie . There is some contention over what was agreed by the lawyers and what the judge ultimately decided to do , but it 's besides the point . While it admits that yes , there was a victim here , it brushes it aside quickly so you can sit there and spend two hours learning how Polanski was victimised .

1 I could n't agree more , Though i do like most Marvel movies , the constant need to be funny and have witty jokes through out the movies gets old very fast .

1 Oops .

1 Peggy Carter is not that sort of girl , thankyouverymuch .

1 I generally like the commenters there but not for this .

1 > terrifying If my childhood memories are any indication , the TV show Joker still applies .

1 I agree somewhat . He 's proven an ability to generate a return on investment so far . At the end of the day , that 's what 's important to producers and is likely why his films keep being made despite bad reviews . However , I think he 's been able to do that so far because he 's been trading in on the reputation that Sixth Sense gave him , not because he 's a smart filmmaker who knows how to produce profitable movies . I believe his track record of box office success will continue to decline unless he can produce a more critically successful movie in the near future .

1 Nobody .

1 Well that 's a silly thing to say . Of course he removed things to cut down on running time . Was the subplot of Frodo pretending to move to Buckland in the movie ? Was Tom Bombadil ? Were the Barrowdowns or Old Man Willow ? Was Glorfindel ? What about Elladan and Elrohir , or Beregond or Bergil ? Was the Scourging of the Shire ? These are just the first few examples off the top of my head .

1 IIRC , he is actually quite sincere in his questioning . I watched his documentary on the WBBC and he was very genuine and yet concerned and appauled .

1 In defense of your sub , a lot of your classmates probably did n't get it . Even though the movie shows him becoming poor , they 'd still think `` yeah but he 's Mozart , how could he not have money to be buried ? ''

1 RAH-BIES

1 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . Before Sunrise . Last Life in the Universe if you want something a lil more depressing .

1 Seriously , TheFeed . Interesting post . But by virtue of using `` To '' for `` Too '' two times , I must downvote . Twice .

1 From what I 've heard , Zuckerberg is n't exactly a fan of how he 's portrayed in the film . I think it may be promotion for Facebook and Zuckerberg like Friday the 13th is for summer camp .

1 And it took me until I was 25 to understand he was buying whippets ; )

1 I disagree . Anne Hathaway nailed that role .

1 Can someone make sense of this for me please ? I really ca n't make any of it out , it would be appreciated and rewarded with an upvote . * To clarify , I literally can not read the chart . It 's sloppily drawn , in pencil .

1 Do not read Cooper 's book , it is garbage . Read * Tank Men * instead , which consists mostly of first-person accounts from the war , interspersed with vital bits of context to make sense of it . Death Traps is trash because it does n't contextualize anything , and is pretty much 100 % responsible for the more vicious lies tainting the Sherman 's reputation .

1 83 was n't a great year for movies . I 'd have to go with A Christmas Story .

1 She was good in True Detective .

1 I can only speak for myself as a general audience member , but after a long wait and such a reinvigorated vision coming off the first , I expected ... more . I thoroughly enjoyed the film , but I ca n't help but think `` that was it ? four years for a rehash of an old story , and a remarkably smaller scale than the first ? `` .

1 You know ... I used to be like you guys . I hated Keanu growing up , even in the Matrix movies . I thought he was kind of wooden , it 's always Keanu being Keanu ... . Then I realized something ... Clint Eastwood is always Clint Eastwood , and no one complains , the man is a film legend . Keanu is similar to that acting style ... no , he 's not going to play a new character , but you wo n't doubt for a second that he 's really feeling whatever emotions he 's conveying on screen . Watch more of his films , see the subtlety of his work , and you 'll really enjoy him . Constantine and Man of Tai Chi are great examples .

1 `` Did they really shoot me in the fuckin head ? ''

1 I always heard it as Channing Taint-Yum . Both equally disturbing really .

1 Some days you just ca n't get rid of a bomb ...

1 Good effort .

1 Only when it 's REALLY inconvenient for the main character .

1 I enjoyed Ruffalo in Shutter Island . The way he held himself and spoke felt like he was straight out of the '50s .

1 ... Wait , what ?

1 > Vulcan IDIC Yes , based on what I see in Memory Alpha that 's probably it and I am mis-remembering the outcome . > * The invention of the IDIC by Gene Roddenberry caused friction between him and Leonard Nimoy , who saw it as a cheap ploy to sell replica merchandise to fans . *

1 That 's a South African accent , not a british one . But he did nail it . That movie was the turning point for me on Leo .

1 Usually in trailers they have to make blood a different color or completely remove it so that the trailer can be approved for all audiences .

1 You are correct . Sorry about that .

1 No , I just have enough experience with that area of YouTube video to know I 'll likely be wasting my time watching somebody aggressively poring over minuscule details in order to paint their opponent as a broad villain . I was hoping for a response * from you * because it was your point I was asking about .

1 [ Z \ ( 1969\ ) ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0065234 / reference ) no question is the most blisteringly paced and exhilarating thriller to come out in the 60 's . It won the Oscar for Best Film Editing , and you can see exactly why it was so deserving .

1 Well , who knows ? No one 's seen it yet .

1 Yes , I often go out drinking at clubs and Netflix should be my babysitter , right ? If I had already said it 's `` frustrating to have to do this '' she 's obviously not , in fact , unattended is she ? It 's frustrating because I have to stop whatever I 'm doing , such as cooking , to launch the next one . There are other situations , as well , if you use your imagination .

1 Not a cartoon , a toy commercial .

1 Only if all the new Rangers can actually fight , but Tommy saves the day with awful fight choreography and bad acting . And I want all the other characters to comment on it in film . The new ones glancing to each other and wondering why the Putty fell down when it did n't even look like his fist hit it . That sort of thing .

1 Your point is valid . I ca n't unread the book , and see the movie with fresh eyes . So I could n't really say how I would percieve Ender otherwise . While watching the movie I let myself enter into the world , and filled in the blanks with knowledge from the book . So I think that knowledge let me feel more of how I was supposed to feel at certain scenes , if that makes sense . I have to re-read it again too , because my memory is a little hazy on that first fight . Did n't the movie cut out him breaking a kids arm on the ship too ? That probably would have happened in the film too close to the last fight and just made Ender look like an asshole .

1 That 's one of the reasons I loved it . It took all the tropes of superhero movies and played as it most likely would in real life . So it 's clearly mentally unstable people trying to fight crime and people getting seriously hurt and killed during fights / random attacks . Grounding it in bitter , depressing reality to the point where it is shocking because we expect certain things to happen because of it being a movie . I love Kick-Ass , but it goes into a different direction with the concept and becomes more wish fulfillment than real life superheroics . Especially at the climax when Elvis starts singing .

1 [ Nice ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=vp6yBwZgpxA ) . It melds into Silver Sun Pickups ' Panic Switch amazingly , which I 've always thought is trailer music in waiting .

1 I 'll give them credit just for using the original instead of a cover . Here 's the [ scene ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ppSUnOB4DZw ) .

1 He made that one ? That movie blew me away . with a horrifying ending . Seriously , it gave me nightmares .

1 I think what he 's saying is that you need to tie the movie to the real world in some facet in order to be relatable to the audience . No one cares about the well being of a Transformer because the `` rules '' are not clearly defined . Pain thresholds , method of death or mutilation etc . What Affleck is saying , as I see it , is that you ca n't have Batman get thrown through a building and survive because the audience ca n't empathize with that and stay emotionally invested with what 's happening on the screen tl ; dr if it 's not kinda real people do n't care

1 ( Released in one theater in 1998 for Oscar qualification , but released for wide in 1999 )

1 Hey before you downvote me maybe do a small amount of research about him , I loved his stories too , but his actual stories before they have gone through the filter of publishers are misogynistic , abusive to children especially female children nightmares and his interactions with his publishers were so bad even the publisher making millions from him refused to deal with him anymore and would not allow him to speak to their staff anymore .

1 I like this . i want to see this .

1 They do n't .

1 yes yes . We have heard this for the umpteenth time .

1 I do n't think a lot of people are basing their choice off of what actually helped them during a terrible breakup . From my experience after the worst breakup of my life , any movie involving relationships is a no-no . The more that movie revolves around relationships , the worse . I still have n't seen 500 Days of Summer , myself , but I ca n't imagine recommending a movie which the synopsis starts off as 'The protagonist reflects on a failed relationship ' as a great start to get over your ex .

1 yes a million times . i was super disappointed

1 But more like Ezio Auditore . I 'm still convinced they straight ripped off his character and Disney-fied him

1 Depp was 30 ? Wow , I thought at most he was 24 there .

1 My shoe is bigger than dis kaaaher ! !

1 I would n't give Brett Ratner that much credit . It was n't just the subpar writing to blame .

1 Bacon my Lettuce on some Tomatoes

1 I recall in the interview he talked about how he got the job . An executive asked him about his interests , and McTiernan said something along the lines of `` cars , and guns '' . Because they wanted a mans man to direct their `` Rambo versus Aliens '' movie .

1 Not a waste , it 's actually an incredibly smart move on Paramounts part . Think of it this way , what audience do you think they need to make this movie a success ? The ones who rarely read books , but love zombie movies . Brilliant !

1 This . I did n't see the film that got the golden bear , but I was VERY surprised when I heard it only got the Best Director award . It should have won every prize . It 's that good .

1 as a bass player , that was my first thought ...

1 By the end of the movie Lucy is SPOILERS time traveling , using psychic powers and basically becomes a god . Like I do n't see how anyone watching that movie could think it 's ANYTHING close to reality .

1 Absolutely . Of her accent films , I really love * Out of Africa * too .

1 That American ? Dick Cheney .

1 I would critique your contributions , but I 'm afraid that I 'm unable to find any .

1 No . At the time , she was under the impression grade-school was the same thing as high-school .

1 I have n't thought about that movie in years . I remember it being pretty good . I saw it in the local indie theatre when it first came out .

1 No . But it 's a pretty good flick . It would have sold more tickets , made more money , and generated a wonderful franchise .

1 I sat here thinking , she 's gon na open her eyes . Still shat myself .

1 I hope so , but how can they possibly do the book right ?

1 I actually liked them both , to be honest , but you and I are both in the minority . The films did poorly critically , in the box office , and with fans . A recipe for success , this is not . I mean , truth is , Jekyll & Hyde just is n't as compelling a story for modern audiences these days . At least , non-sexy Jekyll & Hyde . Dexter and vampires and shit is fine , but big neanderthal smash machines ? Ca n't unleash my repressed homosexual desires on that , no siree .

1 Man this joke is getting old .

1 Thank you Captain Hindsight !

1 yeah it was funny enough and then him realizing it was such a good payoff and it seemed like a number of people completely missed it since they were already laughing

1 I 'm 39 and it worked for me .

1 As a freelance videographer ... .it really is that important . I 'll spend 30 minutes setting up lighting just for a shot that will be 10 seconds in length . It makes all the difference in the world and is the easiest way to make something look big budget .

1 You ca n't copyright an idea but you sure as hell can guard a treatment or script by registering it w / the WGA ( Writers Guild of America ) . It 's only $ 25 after tax . If you only have an idea , and it 's literally just an idea , you have to flesh it out into some kind of intellectual property .

1 I have been , and always shall be , your fan .

1 What the fuck is wrong with you ?

1 I hate that movie . Actually , hate is too weak a word . Abhor . I abhor that movie .

1 ELI5 why every question is now `` ELI5 ''

1 make me feeeeeellll goooooood

1 What are you even responding to ?

1 They all came of age about the same time as Woody Allen , if they did n't let their egos get in their way and made modest budget films like he did they should have still been able to flourish artistically even if they could n't make ( in the case of Coppola ) these grand epics . Look how Herzog was able to improvise with whatever budgets he had on hand . Plus there was plenty of money during the indie film / home video explosion in the nineties . I agree the post Star Wars paradigm changed filmmaking a lot , but they still should have made some nice films .

1 `` There 's nothing to cure ! '' Yeah , that was a ridiculous entry .

1 > I guess Reddit does n't care much that most people were disappointed by the film . 74 at Metacritic with an 8.5 user rating . 795 positive ratings vs . 98 mixed / negative ratings . You have an interesting definition of `` most '' .

1 Right ? I love firefly and all but nothing about Dollhouse !

1 dude , you just told everyone .

1 Kids stories usually have a lot of coincidences in them . My writing mentor said that in a kids movie you can have up to three coincidences before some start getting bothered by it . With a more adult story you MIGHT can pull off one big one but you want to stay away from them .

1 Fap away , fellow ex-mod !

1 But who could * ever * forget such incredible classics like : Barnyard Shark Tale Surf 's Up Space Chimps Chicken Little Alpha and Omega Over the Hedge Hoodwinked Valiant Mars Needs Moms Open Season Planet 51 ... and so many more . Truly unforgettable masterpieces of our time .

1 What 's so messed up with him is that I almost sympathized with him in the end . His grand plan , in the end , was to make Dae-Su know his pain .

1 Zebraman 2 : Attack on Zebra City

1 stop , you 're making me hard .

1 kate is totally naked on screen , you see full ass and titties . It 's like you said its bullshit because it was like the biggest movie ever and so they made an exception entirely for money .

1 I read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia . She is n't mentioned . I can only assume that she dies before she can finish `` fucker . ''

1 > Bryan Singer rape controversy . Honestly I do n't even think that was the biggest news story that week .

1 It was a * sick as fuck * movie .

1 Did you watch it ? It 's 95 minutes long , 25 minutes of which were flashbacks to earlier parts of the movie .

1 Throwing dynamite at people from a blimp sounds exactly like a Christopher Walken thing to do .

1 A teaser for a trailer . Or possibly even a teaser for a teaser .

1 I used to work for Yahoo ! ( but not in the news dept . ) which is why I started reading the news . It was amazing . I also chuckle every time someone complains about Yahoo ! deleting their revolutionary super important comment because Y ! is run by either `` right wing corporate shills '' or `` leftist commie libtard controlled media '' depending on the posters ideology . Dumbasses ... our system was just constantly breaking . Nobody there has time to comb through hundreds of thousands of posts per day just to delete your buried nugget of `` truth '' .

1 Is n't that just an orchestra warming up while a cartoonist doodles in the corner ?

1 The script , or at least the version that was around 5 years ago when Bill Nighy was still attached , is fantastic .

1 That scene during the s ? ance , wow . What an awesome range of characters and emotions she pulled off . She is an incredible actress .

1 As he mentioned , this are the bigger ones .

1 Sour Patch Kids

1 great actor , maybe new villain ?

1 Dubstep being featured in commercials for Red Tails , a movie about the Tuskegee Airmen , almost broke me .

1 Keep looking forward , because you may be waiting for quite awhile . That 's not a real trailer , it 's more of a test run to gauge interest and try to get a studio to back the real thing .

1 Her and Nightcrawler

1 but in order for that goal to be met , the crew has to survive too .

1 That 's great to hear , I loved that movie

1 He 's talking about the post-credit scene in The Amazing Spider-Man , not The Avengers .

1 If that 's the kind of horror we 're talking , God Loves Uganda is in the same vein .

1 yeah t-rex was perfect size , when they made spinosaur it was not the same . Spinosaur is kind of lame , and the way they got him to kill t-rex was so obvious . If they bring a bigger dinosaur in again that kills the spinonsaur ... hopefully they wo n't do that . Something more scary would be making a more clever dinosaur , like how the velociraptor opened the door in JP1 that was scary . But only if they do n't take it too far , the thing with the horn in the third one was silly

1 prawns

1 I always thought she looked a little bit like a really pretty monk fish .

1 well he was in sweeny todd and is in le mis ? rables so i 'm pretty sure he 's got singing down . I 'm fairly certain he can get his personality down as well

1 I totally agree . Cumberbatch was excellent but the nods to the original series and hammy one-liners were way over used . The movie was ok . I enjoyed it but I doubt I 'll be buying it when it 's released on disc .

1 The book I saw this in was comics from 1980-1984

1 Maybe his character has become so passionate about his search for employment that he has completely forgotten about eating . He can only apply himself to one task and that task is finding a damn job . I know when I have some important thing to do , I will literally miss meals because I am focused on the thing .

1 The movie seriously sucks you in and brainwashes you , I found myself extremely attached to it . The music and acting was brilliant , I enjoyed it . I also love PT Anderson

1 What he meant was that he could n't see the specific difference between 60fps and 24fps , rather than an arbitrary difference . * a * difference * the * difference Not the same thing .

1 I just wo n't tell her..and worry about the blue balls later

1 I think it was actually like 15 minutes , but only the first 5 was with the music , the rest was just the ambient sounds within the scene .

1 https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=118GmArZW04

1 Do n't ask Michael Bay to use logic ! His brain would esplode .

1 We should dig him up and hang him again

1 Mrs . Incredible had a pretty length monologue explaining the gravity of the situation ( being trapped on the island ) to her children which was really cool .

1 Holy shit batman !

1 They are both truly worth reading and watching in and of themselves , and the film 's plot uses some very clever tricks to remain faithful to the book - specifically , the parts with Fred Savage and his grandfather work extremely well in place of Goldman 's semi-autobiographical `` abridgment '' .

1 Pay better ! ? No one thinks about the profits ! / s

1 Super green .

1 Sometimes I wish I could go back to the days when all you had to go on was the ad in the newspaper and the trailers you semi-remembered from watching other movies .

1 I totally agree . I 'd rather watch Jason Statham shoot people and blow shit up than some saccharine piece of schlock about a dead dog .

1 Thank you ! This is my least favorite movie of all time .

1 Profanity * and * commercial breaks . What a country !

1 You 're welcome . Do n't be surprised if it keeps coming back to you for the next few days . As emotionally haunting as it is for those of us who have seen it , it must be unimaginable pain for all those personally involved in the story . I do n't think I could ever watch it again , but I will be thinking about it for the rest of my life .

1 Christoph Waltz was definitely Best Supporting Actor material .

1 He 's always been about justice , not necessarily the law .

1 hated it the first time around , really appreciated after a second go through on this one .

1 A remake of an over-the-top parody of itself was ... over-the-top ? Did not see that coming .

1 If that 's how you feel about Terrance Malick I truely feel bad for you . It 's hard to find a movie as special as Tree of Life

1 When you build something like a Death Star , you usually do n't start with the shields and their power supply . You need a fair bit of infrastructure in place before you can turn it on and run it without an umbilical . The Rebels caught it in that state . source : I have jump started a car .

1 Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines .

1 I think it was shutter island

1 That 's what I thought as well . Just re-watched the 2 part mini series last night , too . Thankfully it 's not her .

1 Men want money . Men rob casino to achieve that goal . I do n't really understand what more you would want ?

1 I always hoped he had some major plot line . That he was really Jacob in dog form or something to that effect .

1 No George Lucas . No stereotyped borderline racist comedy sidekicks . An unclunky script . Competent direction .

1 a Masterpiece .

1 Apocalypse Now . It does n't even have a title card , the title is painted on a wall in the background during one of the later scenes of the movie .

1 `` Ooh oh boy Rick , I-I do n't think you 're allowed to say that word , you know . ''

1 Actually no . Working on a movie set with a bunch of adults doing grown up adult stuff , would n't make me expect some bitch to act like a fucking child and start acting out in fits of violent punches . My respect for Lucy Liu ( while pretty limited to begin with ) fell that much more after reading about that incident .

1 When the Hulk has an awful day , everyone else has awfuler days . You ca n't beat that guy down with strength .

1 Yeah ... .. let 's respect a psychopath who regularly threatens to brow up the whole world . He 's deserving of being treated nicely . Riiiiight .

1 First DVD my family ever owned . Loved that movie

1 Hi , JJ

1 Namekians being aliens contradicts the earlier manga saying that Piccolo was a demon . Battle of Gods is the only canon movie because Toriyama says so .

1 When you do something right , people wo n't be sure you did anything at all

1 I can Bella Thorne or even Selena Gomez starring .

1 It 'd make sense that they would be worth more inside of the prison .

1 Yeah the A team was solid summer action fun .

1 LOTR is the only movie experience that comes close to the feeling I had going to see the original Star Wars movies as a child . You are right , Fellowship was the perfect storm . I remember feeling distraught that I had to wait another year to see the next film , and the absolute thrill of standing in the massive line for The Two Towers when it finally came around . The theater was so packed that my two friends and I had to sit in three different areas of the theater and I did n't even care .

1 Alpha as fuck

1 Tyler Perry movie was worse .

1 Play Misty For Me .

1 Oh my god , the first time I watched it , I was sitting alone in my room sobbing for five minutes . I watched it again the next day , and its emotional value had not decreased one bit . I have watched it a few more times and I truly believe it might be one of my favorite films of all time . I can not find one fault in the entire movie . The acting is so emotional , the dialogue is just perfect , and the world that Tim Burton paints is so vivid . You know it is a Burton film , but that does n't make it any less realistic surprisingly . And , again , the emotional payoff is second to none . I do n't think I may ever read the book because the movie was just too perfect .

1 It 's not so much the utilization of classical film techniques , but rather the way Shyamalan has brought tropes of the comic book medium into the realm of cinema . There are many parallels ( in both mediums ) in the way scenes are framed and how characters are portrayed through color and dialog . [ Here 's ] ( http : / tvtropes.org / pmwiki / pmwiki.php / Film / Unbreakable ? from=Main.Unbreakable ) a nice summation of what 's featured in this film . To this day I consider it to be in my top 5 comic book films of all time . And to me , it 's the only one that perfectly straddled the line of genuine cinematic storytelling , with that of appreciation for the comic book genre . I really feel like you had to be a kid who grew up reading these books , to grasp the sensation of seeing an adult take on that world .

1 I think this is going to be a fantastic `` so bad it 's hilarious '' sort of movie . This trailer had some pretty dramatic music , but that nice melody could n't keep me from stifling a giggle at `` gorilla vs helicopter . ''

1 That track can make brushing your teeth or taking a shit seem epic .

1 Then do n't watch it .

1 The T-Rex wo n't be

1 I wonder what it would have looked like if the studio let him alone ? He 's had nary a miss since then .

1 Besmirching a movie is not censorship .

1 Yeah , all his remakes tend to ... suck .

1 I think you mean The Spirit .

1 Very much this . When the Gojira Criterion Collection edition released last year I fervently assembled my friends ( who do not share my passion for Godzilla ) and forced them all to watch it . They were all reasonably excited to watch the original kaiju movie , but half an hour in they were upset to discover it was a serious film with plot and characters

1 Nah , I think Joss does n't even have any power over the big wigs at Marvel .

1 Also some genius decided it would be a good idea to send the entire Gotham City Police Force down a tunnel .

1 I see movies alone all the time , I do n't give a crap about what other people think . I 'm there to spend a couple hours watching ( what I hope will be ) quality work from quality filmmakers .

1 According to movie logic , maybe . But either way , he would n't be sleeping for a whole day , that is the point .

1 21 and Over had hype ?

1 It kind of makes it realer for me . B & W make it look more like a film to me .

1 Or just make a Historical drama about the Black Panthers . That 'd be interesting .

1 You bet , brother GET PUMPED REDDIMANIACS

1 I never have either . I always thought he was high , cause he is . Guy even asks him if he is . Kwan smokes the ganja .

1 That movie was far from confusing . A guy loses a lover and wants to kill himself . What 's there to not understand ? Anyway , on the topic of hating people : I hate people who call movies they do n't understand pretentious . I 'm kinda with you on this one though . Started interesting enough but it got more and more boring the longer it went on . Towards the end of it I was counting in my head to pass time because my wife did n't wan na leave . Just saw the new Polanski movie though and it 's pretty good .

1 Whoa . Scarlett Johansson , aliens , Lynch like visuals , weird minimal music . Sign me up !

1 It was almost everything I wanted it to be . A little short on the gratuitous TnA but excellent .

1 Good point . I was wondering why she sat there scared in that scene , where I 'm sure she 's been through plenty of traumatic events before , what 's so different about this ... Something definitely got to her with the scene with Hulk .

1 Closer and the Before trilogy Closer is the perfect counter Curtis , antidote to cheesy romcoms , it is not necessarily happy but that need not be a bad thing The Before films similar , but happier / rosier . Also 500 days of summer is compulsory to mention and is worth a look in .

1 Laser face is probably Nimrod .

1 He has a certain style of story telling but Buffy , Angel , Firefly and Dollhouse are all quite different stories . Watching one or even all of them does n't really give you any predictability for the rest .

1 Would [ r / toosoon ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/toosoon ) literally be appropriate for this mistake ? ? ?

1 Yeah it rolls right off of the tongue does n't it ?

1 Batista is basically only good at goofy one liners that everyone remembers for being dumb but kinda funny . If that 's what his role is , it should be good . Source : I 'm a wrestling fan

1 That was Beyonce , friend .

1 He said linking the `` enormous success '' to his death is unfair .

1 I think it the fries created a 'sponge ' type barrier , but then again it 's a movie : )

1 I really did n't like the first Cap flick . The Winter Soldier however ... Yeah , that was good .

1 1 . Draw some shapes . 2 . Add the details

1 [ This is a good link ] ( http : / screenrant.com / iron-man-3-spoilers-armors-suits / )

1 Hanks makes everything he 's in infinitely more watchable . `` Catch Me If You Can '' was the first movie with Di Caprio I was able to watch . ( Leo has always given me the ick ) Tom Hanks somehow mitigates that `` ick '' factor .

1 The dang waves , man , that was just intense .

1 Nah , just a hand with vibration lines all around it .

1 Almost like you 're jaded or something .

1 How is Ant-Man 'minor ' ? He may be no Spider-Man , but he 's still pretty important to the MCU .

1 No . I 'm not really sure how you thought of that .

1 I want one of those Hugo weaving heads so bad..

1 > Except that force lightning was used in RotJ , implying that there was a lot more to the force than just telekinesis Well here 's what I actually wrote : > among other things , allowed apparent telekinesis Allow me : > * among other things *

1 Its quite well known he dies .

1 Not bad , but u REALLY need to improve your Photoshop skills . Those claws look reaaaally fake ...

1 No , he says `` extremely talented ass clown . ''

1 I just saw the latest Muppet movie . These pictures look like the heads of the Evil Muppet Babies on muscular bodies ... ... and are horrifying to me .

1 It turns out they had the arkenstone all along , in their hearts .

1 I actually saw a dvd pack today at best buy that had Coraline , Paranorman , and The Boxtrolls all together . Almost bought it , since I 've heard nothing but great things about all 3 ( and have seen none of them ) . But , alas , college kid budget .

1 If you were wearing it and wanted to be able to lift it up and see the picture without taking it off , which way would you put the photo in ? This is a perfectly reasonable way to use a locket , and should only upset you if you 're really OCD .

1 This is kind-of spoiler-y . Might want to warn people who have n't read the book .

1 I think this fits , although 10 things i hate about you is not a bad movie ...

1 Matt Damon .

1 God didnt do that , you did . You 're a fucking narcotics agent , I knew it .

1 Also , his armor is fogged and smudged , symbolizing how clear things suddenly are n't for our favorite Lord of the Sith .

1 I was troubled when she was being pulled out of coma ... if only Adrew Dice Clay went to get his vocal chords worked on by the same clinic that initiated her demise .

1 I 'll agree that this movie is terrible ( although the original is my all time favorite ) ... but I do love it when he gets the jetpack !

1 `` Why did they use that take ? You know , the worst one ? ''

1 clu was fucking creepy

1 Not sure what that is lol , I entered a gofobo drawing and got picked and saw the film at a regal 16 in Deer Park , Long Island .

1 I absolutely adore HST 's work but I felt like I missed so much background info on this , being european . Shitty feeling .

1 Idk if we are really sure or not . I do n't care either way . The guy 's job is to act . Not to suck up to a bunch of internet doofuses .

1 I Will Be Back- Oh Hai Mark

1 not really . I wanted him to leave , his wife was annoying to me = /

1 Yeah I am bewildered as well . The only explanation I can think of is the effect advertising has on the current movie going audience . Where the general consensus of a movie is predetermined before its viewed . Then the immediate outburst of enjoyment of the film once its released , that directly mimics the pre-conceived conclusions of the film before it was released . Which then leads to the general mentality of people liking the film , because everyone else likes it ... I honestly was bored out of my mind watching this movie . The dialogue , the set pieces , the characterizations , the action , the story ... were all dismal to the point of laughter . I guess I 'm one of the few that actually pays attention during films , where I notice these things .

1 Just a bad movie .

1 The 10 % that 's needed to keep you alive while you doze off ?

1 * WE GOT A WINNER *

1 Why he 's decided to move to directing , if he 's always wanted to do that . His thoughts on 3D would be interesting to hear . Or if he 'll try to film with IMAX on his own projects .

1 You 're giving them far to much credit . It would be `` fetching '' and `` ball pit '' z

1 `` I do n't know why ''

1 It was extremely sketchy , they did n't really have stage buildings or really any safety measures down at the time so what you see fall is pretty much an actual house facade . I doubt it was up to any sort of code or whatnot but it was real wood with a very slim margin of error . When it was shot he was almost the only person left on set because none of his friends wanted to watch him die .

1 I dunno . He had a fair number of pretty awesome action scenes , too . Things stayed interesting by hopping back and forth between the two . Roger Moore 's 007 , on the other hand , was primarily of the lady-sexing persuasion . That said , he did n't really ... I dunno , * do * anything other than have sex . He had that kind of heel-turn-point-gun-kill thing that he did a few times per movie , but that was about it .

1 Probably the entire Evil Dead trilogy really .

1 Try Prisoners and Seven .

1 That 's a pretty catchy tune dude !

1 Yay happy ending !

1 Wyld Stallyns

1 I was certain they 'd give at least this to Margulies , cuz the Good Wife got a nice chunk of nominations and had an amazing 2014 .

1 It really sounds like a money issue . They made him an offer , they negotiated for a while and when it was clear he was asking more than they were willing to pay , they withdrew from negotiations . Add in that he is supposed to be difficult to work with and exceedingly hands-on . They did n't want him trying to steal the show .

1 This is kind of how I feel . Also , the fact that the main character / s first instinct is to try and kill himself seems dumb . Having said that , I have faith in Rian Johnson and it 's received good reviews so I 'll reserve judgement until I 've seen it . As for original original films I 'm looking forward to , I 'm going to say Django Unchained and Wreck-It-Ralph .

1 That 's a great fucking point .

1 ( clone )

1 Um , * Drive Angry * is a phenomenally self-aware grindhouse film .

1 I agree with the godfather . The second one was alright but the first one was so boring I had to watch in three separate sessions .

1 I was rounding a bit , it was May 2003 . Not that that really helps any of us feel younger .

1 `` Real-D 3D glasses were a real innovation back in the day , before they pumped films directly into your brain over the neural net . ''

1 That has the side effect of making that line hilarious . I 'm speaking as an oriental here .

1 As gorro

1 It 's an opinion , not truth .

1 The scene of him crawling across the parking lot in the pouring rain , screaming his wife 's name.. God damn , that 's one of like 5 times in my life I 've gotten teary-eyed watching a movie .

1 I like how you 're deleting all of the comments that make you look bad , especially the one where you said I 'd made myself look like a fool . You 're hilarious .

1 Do you mean drugs ?

1 Love Blue Valentine 's sex scenes , it 's so integral to the story . It 's not just a sex scene , it 's a great emotional piece . Same with Shame .

1 No , he 's the action hero . He 's really in great shape for this movie . It 's incredible .

1 > They call him a predator , and pretty much every animal on this planet hunts because they want to eat . It is called a `` food '' chain , not a `` because I feel like it chain '' . Wow you must really hate the Predator franchise .

1 Van , two , tree Macedonians ... ah ah ah ah !

1 After seeing that scene again it makes sense . The room is white instead of the black that she uses to seduce men . And yes , her / them feeling human emotions is essentially the plot . `` That 's the power of love . '' -Huey Lewis

1 Firs off , thank you for linking to youtube instead of apple 's trailer page . Secondly , this looks fantastic !

1 Because he was probably pretty weak and did n't want to risk getting too far from his raft . The ball was getting further and further pretty quick and if he had gone after it his raft would have drifted pretty far from him . He can swim , though . He swam back the first time he tried to raft out of there and cut his leg bad .

1 It 's funny because the Grey came out in January and was surprisingly one of my favorites to come out that year .

1 It sings .

1 One of the most awesome films of my life . Definitely was not expecting to get teary eyed .

1 Yeah but to be fair Ben Kingsley has played every single ethnicity in the world .

1 I can honestly say the '98 spaghetti turned to shit

1 `` Why hello there old friend ! '' Betrayal next scene .

1 Its not the same guy who posted the Gif that gave this method .

1 You 're welcome !

1 Disney fucking loves princesses and castles . 2 things Europe is well known for .

1 Him stumbling to the bathroom with the salt was impeccable .

1 `` Before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday '' does n't mean she will die at 16 , only * before * the sun sets on that birthday. Could mean when she 's 3 , 7 , 13 , 15 , 16th birthday . Just happens * before * the sun sets that night . This is the reason Stephen has all the spinning wheels burned that day and why Flora , Fauna and Merryweather hide Aurora for her whole young life . Maleficent could off her at any time , fulfilling the curse , she does n't have to wait 16 years . If Aurora was cursed to die * at * 16 , she could just live at home until right before her birthday and then be hidden ( or transformed into something for a day ) . This movie looks like it 's going to finagle original Disney cannon to suit their needs of Maleficent being a stalker , rather than an angry fairy sitting in her castle waiting for news for 16 years because * that * would be a boring film .

1 This is a joke and it is quite a funny one at that in my opinion . Babies lib ' ? Hilarious .

1 I 'm pretty trigger-happy about fan-casting John Hamm for things anyway but this is a casting I could really get down with . Especially if they really let him show his age instead of trying to sex him up .

1 > Why bother making something that does nothing but contradict its own source material ? Money ...

1 http : / i.imgur.com / nywMCYJ.gif Seriously though , I really liked it ! I did n't like Jerry and Mike though , something about Mike 's personality was just unbearable and kind of sad , and Jerry , in reality , his story was sad too . Other than that , I thought it was hilarious , and had a great story to it .

1 I thought this was much better than Bridesmaids . I loved the three girls . I usually super love Adam Scott in everything ( Ben & lt ; 3 ) But his character was kinda weird this time around . I would recommend this movie it was pretty refreshing humor .

1 Oooo fun , how are we organizing them ? 1 . Brad Pitt 2 . Michael Pe ? a 3 . Shia LaBeouf 4 . Jon Bernthal 5 . Logan Lerman 3 / 4 is a toss up . LaBeouf has the greater backlog , but i 've been impressed with Bernthal in what i 've seen him in .

1 No the beginning of Event Horizon is good , the middle is alright , and the ending is just bad .

1 The Happening should be the worst . I understand people loved the avatar series and to see it get shat on made the last airbender the worst . It was a total shitfest , but at least it had decent visuals . The Happening had absolutely ZERO redeeming qualities . Nothing in it was even close to decent . TERRIBLE writing , poor performances , lackluster cgi , ridiculous gimmicks , insanely lame premise , and the worst climax in the history of cinema . Seriously fuck that movie .

1 A tv network did this a couple of years ago , but googling just turns up some info on a 24 hour thing at a theater somewhere . Not sure , but it * did * happen . Maybe TNT ? E : although it may have been other times as well , I 'm fairly confident it was Groundhog Day 2010 . Not sure what network though .

1 How much were you expecting ?

1 I agree with you . He did a great job as Dr . Horrible . And considering I should have a say in who plays me in a movie , I think he fits the bill .

1 I 've noticed that it 's hard to good actors to slip into comedy while it seems to be easier for comedians to slip into dramatic roles .

1 He was part of an ensemble sitcom for 7 years which is why he did n't do much else

1 You did n't discover this

1 Those two things are not mutually exclusive .

1 Yes . I remember this scene .

1 > get weird Good advice to anyone , really ... but especially Tim Burton

1 I think it 's actually really impressive how they made him the protagonist . In the first film I instantly hated him , yet in the sequel I was rooting for him the whole time .

1 Definitely Forgetting Sarah Marshall . Definitely provides a humorous yet true look into breakups and how things get better .

1 As long as we are thinking about the same youth , then they can read the whole title , which says that old men are n't allowed in this country , and not just Old Men .

1 They 're making one . The writer of the first one wrote a nice continuation of the story but FOX is making him change it so it will be more like the first one , they think it 'll bring in more money that way . So instead of a solid sequel telling the story of what 's happening in a world where this kid just killed hundreds of people , we 'll probably get a stinker .

1 American studio , mate . They 're technically considered British-American films .

1 Singin ' in the rain in Clockwork Orange .

1 Nope . After Hours is a great movie .

1 Are you sure ?

1 I like some of the additions , especially where the songs are longer . But a lot of the scenes , like Jake being released at the beginning , just drag on .

1 This never happened to the other guy .

1 The prestige is also a really good movie by Nolan if you have n't seen it , would definitely recommend it .

1 Guillermo [ Del Toro said ] ( http : / www.wired.com / underwire / 2011 / 11 / interview-guillermo-del-toro / all / 1 ) Pacific Rim will be `` a beautiful poem to giant monsters '' . After watching his other films , I 'm on-board ! > It ? s really , it ? s a very , very beautiful poem to giant monsters . Giant monsters versus giant robots . Twenty-five-story-high robots beating the crap out of 25-story-high monsters . We ? re trying to create a world in which the characters are real and how it would affect our world politically , how it would affect the landscape if creatures like this really came out of the sea , etc .

1 Why is it so overexposed ... and why is there a cat ?

1 Suntory time ?

1 Hitch is great for this ; Rear Window , Vertigo , North By Northwest , Shadow of a Doubt , The Man who Knew Too Much ( '56 ) , Rope , Strangers on a Train , Dial M For Murder , Marnie ... Also , Wait Until Dark is awesome .

1 My god Cedar Rapids is near perfect !

1 Because it was n't for her . It was for old biff from back to the future 2 .

1 IF . YOU . DO N'T . GIVE . YOUR . HEART . WINGS-shit !

1 No the real question is how the fuck is Denzel almost 60 years old ?

1 Anyone know the first song in the trailer ? The movie looks good ! I 'm not one for cancer / terminal illness movies -- I find them exploitative and frankly boring , but this one looks like it 's gon na be well done .

1 I never really got into Smallville personally . I do like how Arrow is going . It is a nice origin story that draws elements from his `` Year One '' story which I think is one of the best Oliver Queen / GA stories . I do hope he eventually starts making a few more quips during battle as he is prone to do in the comics . But I honestly see no reason why Stephen Amell could n't just take him to the movies .

1 Contacts can only get stuck if you wear them * way * too long , and the idea of them sliding behind your eyeball is ridiculous .

1 Seriously . `` He was taken before his time : ( `` By himself .

1 Cube . Just Cube .

1 BRB posting on TIL for mad karma .

1 None , thanks . Original cinema would be much nicer . We 've never lived in an age where there is so much to say about the state of the world on so many levels , so let 's look forward and explore .

1 To me it looks as if he 's lost that thin , boyish look a bit , there are a few more lines on his face , and his hairline moved . It 's only a few years difference , so there are n't any major changes , but the side by side comparison lets you see the subtle changes . I just think it 's interesting .

1 Personally liked the Orb of Title-eest .

1 Season 9 Premier : Vince wakes up one morning completely bald . Someone 's stolen his hairdo and started an acting career , hailed by critics as `` The Next Vinny Chase '' . Johnny Drama ca n't tell the difference , starts supporting the new guy .

1 From my understanding , this was what the majority of people saw the ending as . You never knew if it really happened , or if no one gave a shit

1 That 's actually not true either ... http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Takako_Konishi_ % 28office_worker % 29

1 Now I would n't go as far to say I enjoyed it more than Goodfellas . I love The Departed , it 's an excellent movie , but Goodfellas is Goodfellas !

1 Then again , Katniss is a very flat character . She does n't show emotion . It 's Peeta that had to provide all the emotion , and the actor fell just a bit short . That being said , they stuck to the plot wonderfully .

1 Honestly , all the Lego games have been pretty good . My least favorite have been the Batman and Harry Potter games , but even they were great .

1 Frank Darabont has a bit of a reputation of being stubborn to a fault and not bowing to studio demands . Thus , he gets a flack from studios `` for being difficult to work with '' . It 's happened with The Walking Dead , it 's also happened with `` The Huntsman '' , which he was so supposed to direct , but then later got bumped off .

1 Prince of Egypt Brave level : 60 caigins

1 Oddly enough , Kurosawa was one of the few directors who did get better as he got older ! I honestly believe 'Kagemusha ' and 'Ran ' are two of his best . In fact , they are two of the best films ever made .

1 Negative . 300 screens means 300 screens . You can get an actual theater count or a screen count from rentrak.it has to deal with how many prints a theater is booked with . For example if I have it on screen 1 and 2 , I 'm booked with 2 prints of it and it would count as 2 in the screen count .

1 Yes but to those committing it , it does n't seem selfish at all . You reach a point where you see your death as being the ideal scenario . You see your life as a problem for everyone , and killing yourself is the only solution . That 's the thing about suicide ... it 's not * reasonable * to people looking at it from the outside . From our view , it seems selfish and foolish . From the view of the person committing suicide , it 's the most selfless and wise thing they can do .

1 It is indeed ! It 's black vinyl . We had more WoW decoration in our old apartment , I ca n't find any pictures now : (

1 That 's quite an exaggeration . He only sings the song twice , and each time its only a couple of lines , and there 's a lot more going on in the scenes than simply him singing . I agree that the main issue in the film was pacing though , it definitely needed a little more breathing room .

1 There also were n't as many choices when it came to movies and therr werent multiplexes with 20 screens all showing movies at the same time .

1 Was n't that the point of the film though ? He was n't supposed to fit into the group .

1 Boring ? No . Maybe if you have no imagination , which is what this movie is ALL about . Convoluted ? YES ! The Baron has been part of German folklore for generations , his chief claim to fame being that he spun some VERY tall tales . That was the point of the movie , you see . I wonder who you are to not be able to understand this . I actually feel some pity for you and hope your life is not so grim and horrible as I might picture . Good luck to you

1 Let me guess . You 're under 20 , so the special effects would bore the hell out of you . That 's the way it is with my nieces and nephews . I pulled out a Nintendo that I enjoyed as a kid , and they wanted no part of it . It 's all about the superior graphics of PS3 and XBox .

1 Fuck Tyler Perry and his stupid , reductionist , non-humorous stereotype-perpetuating bullshit . Bring on the downvotes , but his comedy is actually harmful .

1 I have never * ever * seen anyone talk shit about Pitch Black . I think it 's the reason the rest of them get so much hate . The first one was just perfect .

1 It really did nothing different for the possession genre , and what it did do was clich ? d and worse than most other possession films . Take the bar scene for example -- the conversation about the male in crisis was exactly the same as the protagonist of The Exorcist . The problem is the dialogue was a bit laughable and the film was more obvious about the subtleties that made the characters in The Exorcist more complex .

1 Yeah , and on the same website , it says that it was shot at Paramount tank for the final scene [ http : / www.thestudiotour.com / productions.php ? id=11 ] ( http : / www.thestudiotour.com / productions.php ? id=11 )

1 I love how the classic Thor looks from the comics but I really lile some of the more Asgardian elements of his armor in some of those , especially the helmet

1 Boy , that never gets old . ... Said no one .

1 Sam Rockwell plays a pharmacist in his new movie .

1 Thankfully that new Deadpool movie is looking really good .

1 What the hell is the matter with you ?

1 Maybe , maybe not but you managed to show to a wide audience how much of a jerk you are .

1 Honestly , I think he 's one of those actors who can only play a very specific `` type '' of character . He typecasts himself . Even as `` Alan Turing '' ( yeah , right ) he 's basically just Sherlock Holmes , but this time he 's * canonically * gay .

1 Now that you mentioned it , can not unsee : (

1 Ariadne was just along for the ride because she knew of Cobb 's `` Mal Problem '' . She was just the architect of the dream and was not an actual dreamer .

1 I guess because it fits the looks of posters for other disney classics .

1 Jumanji was fucking awesome !

1 I dont think he hopped on the band wagon at all . All three movies were filmed at once and staged to come out consecutively to give ample time for theatre and vhs\dvd release which for a series on this scale , would be about a year . Also ... .twilight came out 7 years AFTER LOTR . So if anything . They followed him and harry potter . As both harry potter and fellowship were released in 3 weeks of each other .

1 The smiths are one , but Bambi and Thumper are 2 , and that makes 50 . 9x6 grid is 54 . +1 for Thumper in Bambi 's spot , -5 for Lo Pan , the Alien , the Invisible Man , the Ring chick , and Summerisle taking up two spots .

1 Except that the old one is considered a sci-fi classic that achieved huge critical and commercial success . It 's kind of impossible for it to be under rated .

1 We 've heard him speak for ~30 seconds , we do n't know whether he wants to conquer the world , destroy it , save it , etc .

1 Upvote for `` out of the fuckin blue . ''

1 Just waiting for the reimaginings twenty years from now .

1 so , how 's your sex life ?

1 Directed by Christopher Nolan !

1 At first I thought you meant Hugh Laurie as Galactus , and now I ca n't think of anything else .

1 Yeah , SantorumPalin2012 seems like the last person you might expect to believe in God . Good eye , Holmes .

1 RIP Chris Reeve .

1 Loved the fist two , and all of GDT 's other work , would definitely want to see a third .

1 Do you know the title of that documentary ?

1 I LOVED the original Logan 's Run , but I am excited for this remake .

1 John Williams started the score a week ago , but you know that shit is gon na take a couple of months .

1 is it just me or does this movie never get mentioned ? it definitely should . it 's amazing .

1 and GEMA strikes again . Blocked in Germany .

1 Hobbit filmS . A plural hasnt made me that happy in a long time .

1 `` Release the rumour-mongers ! ''

1 Just a fun fact , but atlas is n't supposed to be holding the world , he 's supposed to be holding up the heavens .

1 and i love every episode of TWD , and devour ( hah ! ) every new trade paperback of the comic !

1 The stakes were anything but low , Ultron was about to wipe out the entire planet with that custom made meteor .

1 Overrated ? No . Over talked-about ? Absolutely . He is one of the best `` young '' directors in Hollywood and almost every one of his movies has been very , very good . In fact , due to his relatively young age , it is fair to get excited about what may come from him in the next 25 years or so . That said , he is n't the only director out there producing great movies . Hell , before his next movie comes out we are likely to see dozens and dozens of great movies , many better than his . While the Nolan hard-on on this subreddit is justifiable , I wish people enthusiastically pointing to the bulge in their pants would get over him . I get it . He is great . Now shut the fuck up and talk about one of the zillion fantastic films that he was n't involved in . They are n't hard to find . edit : I realized that may come across a bit harsh . It 's not a condemnation on you OP . While the subject of him is tired , I commend you for taking a fresh angle and at least challenging him as imperfect .

1 I saw that recently , it changed my views on Carell 's acting . I loved it .

1 I 'd say they 're pretty much on the same level although the book had some serious cringe parts .

1 Honestly , I think it had the philosophical strength of a 12 year old fresh from bible study . The logical fallacies stack up to a mountain by the time the credits roll . And that 's only half of the problem with the movie .

1 last act reminded of Home Alone ... with Bond putting all Booby traps ... i wonder why he forgot to put a pin on the door bell ... works all the time

1 `` She does n't have bad dreams because she 's just a piece of plastic '' : (

1 > requires him to pay 50 % of his income > who had income of $ 1,767,203 How will he eat ? ? ?

1 I 'm fairly sure the Pope would be the last person to get any money if anyone could . The problem is Christianity , Judaism and Islam all have variations of the same stories so no one person or group could exactly profit from these movies .

1 Because they talk about the boy being the closest remaining artifact of their ancestors . They could be advanced humans , but the distinction blurs , does n't it ?

1 THAT IS N'T EVEN FROM THIS MOVIE !

1 [ Gambit - Video Link ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Gn6hIPLO9VQ ) - SPOILERS

1 He 's also a tree !

1 Are you impling that the day you watched Interstellar for the first time was n't the most euphoric day of your life ? Are you a pleb ?

1 Well , not until the last 5 minutes .

1 [ British Accent ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=e3arfPGysRQ ) with Zach Braff .

1 They 're gon na advertise the shit out of it and make plenty of money through happy meals , toys , shirts , etc .

1 Anyone got a link to the final shot featured in the movie ?

1 This is the cover of the version I own . Also , note : Daniel Craig http : / i.imgur.com / yByPo.jpg

1 Ummm . Your off the top of your head was horrible though . I 'm not saying their might be `` better '' options . But none that do n't result in the death of that family . Assuming that scene is necessary , which I think it is , there is no other solution lazy writing or not . You either have him spin the Earth backwards and get a do over or have him magically change the rules of the movie .

1 He did the voice .

1 HA ! literature

1 As if you know anything .

1 I agree . There was a big push for anime adaptions that did n't work for a few reasons . One being the first couple ( The Last Airbender , Dragonball : Evolution ) to see release bombed horribly . Two , Keanu has lost a lot of clout lately . Cowboy Bebop was a pet project of his , and I believe the bombing of 47 Ronin pretty much did in any hope of a Reeves led Cowboy Bebop film . Lastly , Superhero movies . The Anime push was Hollywood desperately trying to find tent pole blockbusters for years to come and with the rise in popularity of the Superhero movie it seems Hollywood scraped or delayed all the anime adaptations in preproduction . Akira , Ghost in the Shell , Cowboy Bebop , will have to wait until someone with A LOT of money and influence comes along or until the superhero bubble bursts . I 'm sorry for the rant but I 'm angry about the loss of these movies too ...

1 Douchebag dad of the day

1 You speak from experience ? My condolences

1 The movie is shitty , but I do n't think continuity is that big of deal . Things like those car doors not matching from shot to shot , they do n't really affect the story . You find stuff like that in The Departed , a lot of continuity errors , because they cut for emotion , and that film won Best Picture and Best Editing . Of course , you can excuse bad shot continuity of you have a strong story . transformers 4 had no story , so it really is just obnoxious editing .

1 Argo is one of a few movies where not knowing history is a plus . I never should have read the Wiki page before that movie .

1 I had this exact theroy when we first saw Avengers . My friend said I was just being a Marvel Nut . I was just telling him `` Its gon na happen so get yo shit ready man '' After the TC said `` One down..Five to go '' and the credits were done ( we left after that ) . I simply turned to him and said `` Boy I sure do hope someone picks up that phone ... '' he responds `` Why ? '' `` Because I * fucking * CALLED IIIIIIIIIIIIT ! '' The only time in my life I 've EVER said I told you so ... but fuck ... .I fucking told ya so . Two years I waited ... ..two years..worth it .

1 > Provoke the Mandarin , prepare nothing to defend . * Except for the massive amount of suits he has in his house already ? > Yes , some of those helicopters were terrorists in disguise but not all of them ( the terrorist approach of the house was on TV ! ) . * So were the terrorists .

The heavy artillery suit ... Or any other suit featuring that ultra powerful red lazer from Iron Man 2 and the Avengers ... * JOKES ? IN * MY * MOVIE ? The suit was in pieces and had minimal battery power . I should n't have to explain this . > Nobody recognizes Tony Stark in Tennessee . * Except for , you know , those people that did . > The mark 42 is compatible with a lot of power sources , like a Tennessee tool shed electrical plug . Yet , it seems unable to get its power from a motherfucking ARC reactor embedded in the chest of its sole user and designer . * The suits clearly are powered by sources independent of the reactor as evidenced by the fact that they 're flying around without anyone wearing them . > Suits falling apart if you look at them too intensely but suddenly withstand anything the plot throws at them . * I thought that the fight choreography in this movie was really fun . Did we watch the same movie ? > I 'll stop here as I spent far too much time desicating this movie already . * Did you mean dissecting ? Anyway , sorry this movie was n't Avengers 2 . That seems to be what everyone was anticipating .

1 Both . Aaron Taylor-Johnson 's character is fighting Godzilla to keep his family safe , basically . So it 's a bit of both .

1 Would be awesome but it takes dedication to good writing and story to make strong women who do n't look like super models , and Marvel just makes pulp . It 's just action scenes and T & A .

1 Spiderman 2 , when MJ leaves Jonah 's son at the altar .

1 Ah yes , the World Health Organization . Love their movies .

1 Just buy the limited edition . Or google `` Memento chronological version ''

1 Yeah , I literally just finished Shutter Island about 10 minutes ago and logged in and saw this post , go figure . I was struck by how similar the two were , especially once they both had a crazy dead wife haunting Leo . I really enjoyed both films though , and I was surprised at the amount of criticism for Shutter Island . I can understand complaints about pacing , but the acting , cinematography , and plot were plenty enough to overcome that for me ; I did n't even mind that the plot twist was rather obvious as it was so interesting getting there .

1 On PS3 , you can just change your DNS to get US Netlflix .

1 +1 for the Special Jury Prize . He 's a cheeky bastard .

1 ... carry on

1 > Being upset about her being too skinny is really just * childish and stupid . *

1 Spielberg backed out from directing at the last minute and asked Johnston to step in last minute as a favor to him . Johnston has done 2nd unit directing for Spielberg ( as well as effects work ) in the past . Johnston got to set to find out they had no script and were making it up on the fly . I do n't blame him for that . Lost World ( directed by Spielberg ) was also pretty damned bad .

1 That was done on purpose though . That movie , Black Dynamite , is a parody movie . A hilarious and well made one too .

1 Nacho Villagando already did it with Open Windows .

1 Babe Alert ? Really ? What is this 1985 ?

1 that 's not even remotely what I said

1 Well , not too defend the awful sequels too much , but from what I understood , when Neo made the choice to save Trinity instead of `` resetting '' the Matrix , he created a connection between him and the machine Source , that yellow shit he sees after being blinded . So through that connection , he is able to influence machines in the `` real world ''

1 He went for the `` sound it out '' method

1 I am not a clever man .

1 Can you even tell what kind of pant he was wearing in the classic comic strips and cartoons ? Jeans do n't seem out of place for Charlie Brown , no matter what era this is supposed to occur in . On closer inspection , the fact that Peppermint Patty is wearing sandals in the snow seems like a bold choice .

1 I 'm not sure , I have n't seen it yet ...

1 GIRRRRLLLSSS ! edit : Drink ! Drink ! Feck off !

1 Oh , so that 's why they start off empire with Luke getting mauled by a wampa .

1 It 's a classic move . I believe this is Miyazaki 's 7th time he has withdrawn from retirement .

1 The Sound of Music That Edelweiss shit is golden for family time .

1 Someone `` spoiled '' the movie for me on Reddit saying the film is crazy and Lou gets shot out of cannon at the end . I 'm glad that 's not how it went down though .

1 Over their taste in music ... Most crime is organized crime . Most crime is intraracial . This is a movie * precisely * because a crazy guy shot four random kids of a separate race over their stereo and his entire defense in court relied on prejudices about their race and age . That makes this a relevant initiation to a larger national discussion and a good subject for a film . Sure , they could have made a movie about someone catching their significant other in bed and stabbing them with a knife or a drunken brawl , but that 's how * most * murder works regardless of your race since the beginning of time , that 's endlessly common .

1 Pretty sure I read somewhere that the extras who played the soldier were not told what Palin would say , and the only instructions they had was to not laugh at all . He 'd also change it up between takes so he always said something different .

1 I heard they were setting him up to be the villain in the sequel . Planting the seed . Agreed though , Cillian is awesome in everything .

1 This is what I was looking for ! nice !

1 [ hoo boy ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / oEuue.gif )

1 A New Zealand film called Eagle vs Shark is pretty good . I would say there were similarities to Napoleon Dynamite in terms of style and being offbeat . It has Jemaine Clement from Flight if the Conchords .

1 Love Jeffrey Brown . `` Clumsy '' is one of my favorite books .

1 Yeah , that was pretty revolutionary for 1977 .

1 I 'm seeing both regardless . It 's a great time for superhero films in general , but I feel like the MCU currently has the upper hand in terms of movie quality and popularity .

1 NOOOO

1 Why is it pathetic ? If they admire the film and style and want to make a version that English speakers can enjoy , and possibly reinterpret it to create their own story , what 's wrong with that ? Could you provide some examples of what you mean ?

1 `` Get Your Damned Hands Off Of My Lets ? ''

1 That would be 'the ol ' Reddit Sith-aroo ! '

1 Announcing best cinematography I believe

1 All I see when I hear that is Bender with his fist in the air .

1 To put things in perspective , that 's half the number of troops they had stationed in Afghanistan 0_o

1 I stopped watching the trailer halfway through because it seemed to be giving away a lot ( even though the shot that made me think that happens about ten minutes into the movie ) . I 'm glad I did n't watch the rest of the trailer , but after seeing the movie , it 's obvious that it must have been a hard one to advertise for . If you do n't reveal some of that stuff in the trailers , it would just look like your average everyday `` cabin in the woods '' movie . I do n't think they did too bad of a job of treading the line between giving away too much and doing enough to make it look kind of interesting , even if it does n't really match the tone of the movie itself .

1 Encouragement for us all ! I wan na be the regular dude who gets with VS models too !

1 Honestly as a big fan of sword fights I think The Three Musketeers 2011 had the best fights in a recent film , and possibly some of the best ever . Sure , the movie is awful , but the characters use correct form , do n't clash like idiots , and use their off hands to block and bat away their opponents ' swords . It 's actually much closer to how people would have fenced .

1 I 've seen a few films in theater and had some middle aged dude decide he should comment aloud on the movie as it plays . 'Oh that was so unrealistic ' 'I think that 's the guy from Alien ' 'I ca n't believe x directed this . ' You are n't important , middle aged man , I do n't want to hear your commentary .

1 The 400 Blows , Breathless , Pierrot le Fou , The Samurai

1 A 200m blockbuster squeezing into the Top 20 highest grossing films of the year is no great achievement . Over 75 % of it 's box office was from overseas - this would n't be a problem if like Alice in Wonderland it made a billion dollars worldwide , but it is because it made barely 400m and made clear that the western audience just was n't interested

1 I really enjoyed it actually . I thought it was a nice contrast to most movies today that feel like they need to pull the rug out from under you every few minutes . It was like a beautiful , slow burning fire .

1 No , it 's just THAT terrible .

1 I thought if this was the 80s or the 90s , this movie would 've been released direct to video . It would sit on the shelf for 2 years before I 've discover it . Then I would track down a copy to show it to as many friends as I can and call it a hidden gem . I would not call it underrated because that implies people heard of it . Anyway , it was n't terrible . it has a lot of cool moments , but not enough of them to not make it feel like a chore .

1 Philadelphia is not a great movie , Hanks did what any actor would do with that script , in my opinion . But you ask if he is overrated , no , definitely not . Saving Private Ryan , Big , Cast Away , Apollo 13 , A League of Their Own , Nothing In Common , Splash . The guy 's got a stellar batting average .

1 Tons of people have definitely seen Star Trek II . It 's the most famous of the Star Trek movies pre Abrams , many would call it the best , and the scene from II that was redone for IT is one of the most famous scenes in sci fi movie history . Shatner yelling KHAN is an incredibly iconic movie moment and has been parodied countless times . So even if you have n't seen Star Trek II , which many people did , you still probably know that scene .

1 like the french .

1 Wow . Yes . Never a more satisfying revenge when the father gets it later .

1 TDK was kinda necessary just for Dent .

1 Genius , absolute genius . One of my favorite movies just got better .

1 Same , seeing the reviews of RT having the movie come out nearly a month after the U.S. , I found the movie to be pretty good .

1 thanks , man .

1 For a change though I felt that Sinister did a great spin on the `` Haunted House '' cliche right with that twist at the end .

1 That 's not a mullet . His hair was all long .

1 Oh god I can not wait !

1 Go with what you know and get it from Amazon . Also Wal-Mart sucks

1 Water World is one of my favorite movies .

1 Every time I hear or read Road House I thing of that episode of Family Guy when Peter roundhouses everything he sees then chants `` Road House '' .

1 Sting is gon na be so awesome !

1 * I wanted to make it look like he 'd hit me really hard , so maybe he would n't hit me again ! *

1 Last year was so great with Cap 2 , X-Men and GotG - arguably the best year ever . Then there was Spiderman 2 , which seemed to seriously cripple the franchise . Fantastic Four could be a great franchise , but maybe Fox realized in the test screenings that the movie just is n't up to the quality standard of last years films . That 's just a guess , of course .

1 Not excusing Netflix as it 's still a business , but I really do n't think they are `` sticking it to us '' as much as making sacrifices now to stay afloat in this cutthroat time in the industry . I feel / hope that they will make moves that will enable them to provide the service they desire , which is a healthy library of streaming titles .

1 I do n't care what he does at New York Press , I mean if they 're stupid enough to keep on such a terrible critic , that 's they 're business . My problem is that Rotten Tomatoes keeps him in their consensus . Rotten Tomatoes is actually a really great website if you want to see what most people think of a new film , but it 's a bit tainted when they factor in a joke like Armond White .

1 Depp is so typecast into his rolls it 's insane , though it would be interesting to see him under that kind of roll . As much as I love * Benedict Cumberbatch * , I 'm not sure he has the Tony Stark LOOK . He could almost definitely pull off the personality though .

1 Do n't forget that they were abducted by aliens !

1 Exactly what I do . If it 's not `` Opening This Week '' or `` Top Box Office '' , it 's not out . I was thinking the reason it was missing was the opposite , like RT wanted money to show the movie on the page . Like Yelp does with positive reviews . But I suppose it could work the other way , to hide bad reviews .

1 I was thinking of Paul Thomas Anderson and could n't imagine why you hated him , but double-checked and geez ... Between him and Uwe Boll , they 've directed almost every video game movie around , plus * Pompeii * .

1 > Regardless , on it 's own , it really was n't that bad of a film . He won the Razzie and got like an 8 % on Rotten Tomato . I do n't think it was fanboyism over the original that fed the hate for that movie . But otherwise I agree with you . He was my favorite Director for a while from a shot setup perspective . Signs is a work of art in direction . If you watch commentary he talks about how he put lights on the floors to cast deep shadows on the walls and ceilings which created such an intense mood . And those suspense shots like when the camera focuses only on the flashlight in the basement are so good .

1 But ... Melancholia !

1 no one ever panned it

1 D.W Griffith had the KKK as VILLAINS in one of his earlier features . Toss a few drinks back and watch that movie ... it IS poetry . Racist ? You bet . The Birth of a NATION ? No . The Birth of Cinema ? You bet .

1 thats the problem with Nolan using initial takes , he needs to push his actors further from time to time

1 I had put Master and Commander on my list of movies I wanted to watch , and once my ex saw , she went off saying it looked so stupid and she would never go anywhere near a movie that looked so dumb . JOKES ON YOU , IT WAS AWESOME

1 I only wish I could respond to this question . I can not .

1 My brother bought some random movies from a going-out-of-business family owned movie store . Oldboy was in there and * wow * . We were surprised .

1 Yeah , he 's not that big . Oh wait ...

1 Your biases are showing , applebloom . I was going to post something a bit snarky in reply , but after reading through the last 100 or so comments you 've made on Reddit ... I feel obligated to tell you that you 're batshit crazy . Like , it really should n't be a surprise though , right ? You 're a mod of both /r/antifeminists and /r/liberalpropaganda . That said , I think that , in that Rush Limbaugh / Glenn Beck-ian echo chamber you call a mind , wherein you 've become very good at digesting psudo-factual information designed to support your beliefs , you 've developed a truly exceptional ability to filter out things that disagree with your narrative . For example : your cute little argument against multiculturalism a few comments down . You do realize that the only people who buy into arguments like that are the neo-nazi skinheads and the tea terpers , right ? So really , applebloom , this is just a thank you . I appreciate everything you do . Why ? Because people like you make people like me look good , despite the fact that I do n't really do anything special or heroic . You lower the bar so far that I look like a saint in comparison . Keep up the shitty , racist work . I appreciate it .

1 Make me cry in the first five minutes without a word of dialogue ? Strong play , Pixar .

1 Gangs of New York . A lot of people didnt know the movie even ended . It does . It just takes an ass numbing amount of time .

1 Obviously all the poor people are murdered and eaten every year , keeping unemployment and hunger to a minimum .

1 Do movies from over ten years ago count as 'modern ' ?

1 I 'm so angry about all these movies coming out that I do n't have to watch ! Gosh !

1 Sadly I 've not seen this . Thanks for the suggestion !

1 No

1 Watch 3 .

1 No , but you smell what he cooked last night !

1 The bulge in that guys pants ... . @ _ @

1 Not a great example , but I was at the Melbourne Underground film festival last year . It annoyed me a little . The films were mostly terrible . The feature they showed on opening night was described by the MC as a `` Polanski-esque thriller in the vein of Repulsion '' ( actual quote ) . It was the worst thing I 'd ever seen , written and directed by someone who 'd clearly never made a film before but thought he could get by on edginess . It got a standing ovation and the lead ended up winning Best Actor for the whole festival . I lost a lot of faith in the Melbourne Film industry that day .

1 I do n't think so . They usually do n't have these threads for movies unless they are big releases that have a lot of reddit hype .

1 It 's kind of a dichotomy : some french people just adore the american culture and wo n't stop trying to copy it to look / sound cool , while others are , on the opposite , very hostile to anything american ( though they can like the UK instead in some case ) and will sometimes sound like the stereotypical america-bashers .

1 > It moves beat for beat like an old Scorsese film and the cinematography , set and costume design , editing , performances and script are all awesome . As much as people unfairly bash it for being a Scorsese ripoff , it really is David O. Russell 's `` auteur film '' .

1 Wrong thread bro . Lol

1 * First Blood * is an absolute gem . It deserves so much better than its legacy .

1 A lot of that stuff has leaked out , and some of it is really great . I love my Prince bootlegs .

1 Nobody knows , but it does .

1 You thought * Django * was an exception to Tarantino embellishments ? I was under the opposite impression . He put himself in it with an awful Australian accent , had Cristophe Waltz do endless Tanantino-y monologues , and had Jamie Foxx hit a woman with a shot where she subsequently flew 10 feet in the air out of frame . I mean I thoroughly enjoyed the film , but I do n't think of it as not embellished . But you 're probably referring to other aspects , so I 'm curious what you mean .

1 You really need to narrow your field a bit , friend . Pick a genre or a decade . You ca n't just call out half of motion picture history and expect only a couple answers .

1 > I do n't know if I 'm looking into this too much , but could it be that Antoine was thrown out of the window because he got Mia high and she nearly overdosed ? Orrrr it could just be that they shook hands because it was her wedding . no no no .

1 No

1 So ... what 's this about people being mentally unwell ?

1 I think Chase is lucky to have had the career he has - he was cute enough when he was younger that people moved heaven and earth to maximize his talents to their full potential . I did n't know he turned down those other roles , it makes me more question the judgement of the people who would have hired him than anything else .

1 Christian Bale 's batman voice made me laugh every time , I do n't think that 's what he was going for .

1 Do n't talk shit about David Bowie like that , it ai n't nice .

1 WHAT ? ? ? ?

1 I like psychological horrors the best , but the flip side is that they stay with you for far longer . ( Like * The Shining * )

1 Oh , The Way Way Back would be a perfect outside summer movie .

1 They 're not just famous actors , the people I 've listed are really the best of the best in acting anywhere . Voice acting in the US is often just as much of a career as it is in Japan , which is why I made sure to include John DiMaggio - the main difference is that we have a huge pool of world-renown actors to pull from as well . In reality these dubs are more Pixar than Disney , BTW . They 're all controlled by Pixar 's CCO - John Lasseter .

1 Ok , how about this time , we go no bags , and then next time , we do the bags * right * , and go full regalia .

1 Anyone who ranks Battleship as a 9 / 10 has a weird view of cinema . There may have been action , but there was also horrible acting and a lackluster plot .

1 Or before they left the church where she died . Yes .

1 I expected nothing but I actually enjoyed it a lot .

1 Would n't they have been using electric generators ? They said they were `` almost out of fuel '' which is why they needed the hydro dam . They had to be using the fuel for something . cooking , maybe , and heat , also to pump water . I would think somewhere in the crowd was someone who could keep an electric generator running .

1 To be honest there are some flaws which are worth keeping , and that 's certainly one of them .

1 That name made the list for me too . : )

1 Klaus Kinski , the one man more insane than Brando .

1 You remember that scene with the fridge ? The first time i saw that movie , i was right fucked on acid . I didnt think that scene actually even happened , so go on two weeks im thinking , sure , lets watch this again with the roomate , he heard how good it was , and were watching it . sure enough , the fucking fridge scene comes one , and im sitting there freaking the fuck out because my hallucination came back . I was terrified until i realized it was actually part of the movie .

1 srsly imho their robat was heavy hitter , wanted to see more of him in action

1 Say Richard ... who 's your favorite little rascal ? Alfalfa ? Or is it ... Spanky ?

1 The Mummy is a personal favorite and so is The Quiet American , so I do like seeing him around . He 's a solid actor .

1 I 'm cool with that

1 I still have a crush on Diane Lane stemming from this movie .

1 Synecdoche new York put me in a week long melancholy . I did n't give a fuck during that scene in Up , or Toy Story 3 , or when the dog dies in I am Legend . This movie however put me on my ass . You have been warned .

1 $ $

1 This movie only came out about like 5 years ago . Not everyone knows this movie anyway , It 's not like it was Avatar at the time of release .

1 Is promoting your work really that terrible ? It 's just the Oscars , it 's not like he showed up to someone 's funeral like that .

1 that 's ... that 's actually a very good question there , Jaden .

1 Other Way around . US made it for Drugs , but the US ignored the Berne Convention for a hundred years , until as part of the stuff that created GATT and the WTO , we agreed to accept the Berne Convention , and they accepted several patent principles from the US .

1 `` Quit being a baby '' `` Yea , well you look like a gigantic baby ! ! ! ... .I 'm sorry '' `` It 's ok '' .

1 yeah , I have no idea how he 's going to be at the Oscars , and be there live so you can watch True Detective tonight at the same time . He 's so talented

1 Lancelot having no idea what Roosevelt meant was the only bit that tickled me .

1 Its plot is Shakespearean

1 I doubt you 'll be moved by any of his other pieces if you did n't like those . You also did n't say what you did n't like about his films so it 's hard to get an idea of what did n't dazzle you . If you like spy films you may like watching North by Northwest . If not , maybe Hitchcock is n't for you .

1 Hobbits are the definition of sexy

1 It looks nice , but I liked the more crudely thrown together one from * Captain * .

1 I love how the camera pans down slowly to keep them in view , then it pans down to show what 's below them and you do n't see a bush , then it pans down slightly more and still no bush , and right when you 're expecting it to pan down a little more and reveal the bush they smack into the pavement . Watch the scene again and pay close attention to the bottom border of the screen and you 'll see what I mean .

1 Or more likely Jonathan Liebesman , the guy who directed the first one .

1 That 's fine . I 'm sorry we ca n't appeal to all of you . A lot of us feel that the insistent discussion about the same 30 or so films is equally as boring as limiting discussion about said films .

1 Oh wow how embarassing

1 The fucks I do n't give have been split into two parts Part I : The Land of No Fucks & Part II : Finding Fucks

1 It * was * great , but it was n't really a dogfight , it was mostly just two enormous fleets crashing into each other .

1 Zombies Woody Harrelson Jesse Eisenberg Emma Stone Bill Murray as a zombie I 'm not saying I 'm excited but if the boner police show up , I demand a lawyer . EDIT : Alright I 'm not that excited , looks fun though .

1 The TL ; DR made me sadface .

1 I just meant that if they killed off RDJ , less people woild see yhe next film . He has the most star power .

1 if it had been titled `` ferris bueller 's terrible horrible very bad day versus a monster '' and not `` godzilla '' i bet no one would complain about it .

1 Holy shit . I just now got that . I 've seen that movie a hundred times , and for some reason it just now clicked . Brilliant .

1 At the same time a billionaire party boy with a UFC physique would raise a few eyebrows , no ?

1 Your opinion of me has taken a nosedive because I did n't want to get fired ? Or that I enjoyed being able to take a bit of a jab at people trying to circumvent me doing my job ? And what about > Examples of other things I enjoyed : Being able to randomly walk out on a slow night and pick a random couple of people to give free admission to just for good karma . Fixing issues that cause people to have a bad experience and still giving them free passes because the theater is overpriced . Giving random people free passes just because I felt like being a nice guy . Etc . None of that was me just following orders . That was me just trying to be a nice guy .

1 You 're uhhh ... not supposed to talk about that ...

1 Hoping they get Michelle Yeoh as part of the cast .

1 First raise Mako from the dead , he can then summon Basil 's spirit .

1 well , if anything is bleak it 's depression .

1 I only like fantastic mister fox . Anything else he is just being a pretentious fuck . We get it man . Its not even like his style is hard too recreate . Even [ SNL ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=gSEzGDzZ1dY ) can do it . You had me at Wes Anderson

1 Another awesome trivia bit from IMDB : Many of the service rifles carried by the British armed forces are the XM8 rifle . It was intended to replace current US M16 / M4 variant service rifles by 2015-2020 , but the US Defense Department canceled its contract with the rifle 's manufacturer , Heckler & Koch , in 2005 . The rifle is now considered experimental .

1 I think that Verhoeven 's intention was to make a satire of the original book , and not an adaptation per se . And he was wildly successful at that !

1 dick jokes are older than you and me cumbined have some god damn respect .

1 exactly my thoughts .

1 Thank you ! Hmm I wish there was some holiday or almost a month of celebration of the macab and horror . Well guess we will release it in august or middle of winter !

1 only paid for the mod podge

1 Keyboard cat is playing him off ... .

1 another point i 'm not seeing here is reading the lines does help the actors remember their next lines in the script .

1 Shots fired at saltine !

1 I think you mean `` Make like a tree , and get out of here . '' The leaf is the part he * did n't * say .

1 Board stiff .

1 Good Morning Vietnam ...

1 > What is it that makes me able and willing to constantly watch this movie ? Being drunk .

1 A movie should be able to stand on it 's own merit without needing an explanatory sequel . Alien 1 made sense by itself and Aliens added to it , as sequels should do . `` We explained very little in this movie and shrouded it in mystery so please wait for the sequel kthx '' is not a just excuse .

1 It 's probably how the poster gets around copyright .

1 It 's just that it seems like he disregards all of the source material he works with so that he can make sure people know that he owns whatever it is now . That 's fine if you 're building a film from the ground up , but because he works with a lot of adaptations , it comes off as him using the source material to jack himself off and serve himself rather that the audience or the material .

1 That 's what it means .

1 This here is exactly what I was thinking about

1 You 're the only one .

1 I could see it working but Se7en has some fantastic dialogue that I would never want to miss out on .

1 > 1897 Yeah , film-making just has n't been the same since Grover Cleveland 's second nonconsecutive term as President .

1 I like how it 's just Nic Cage beating up women for two hours .

1 My point for mentioning its quality is that it 's not a movie that people are still talking about this long after it came out . Seven years is not a short time , especially not for a film as forgettable as Constantine was .

1 : | : / : O : D

1 Yep , turns out to be much better than Superbad .

1 [ This ] ( http : / www.buzzfeed.com / drewphilp / why-i-bought-a-house-in-detroit-for-500 ) is one of the best things I 've read in 2014 .

1 Favorite line in the movie . It 's like swag and class came together . Clag . Swass . Eh , I do n't know . ( :

1 The other two movies are canon , they 're just not that relevant . They 're specifically mentioned in the histories of new characters -- one of them was involved in the cleanup of pteranodons in 2001 after they escaped in JP3 . It was misreported once and every other website seemed to copy this news .

1 Different people have different experiences . EDIT : Someone is downvoting all of my comments over this . LOL

1 She 's not standing far enough away to make a difference , and the camera is angled by less than 5 degrees , so that 's not enough to change the perspective dramatically .

1 Ok , because a comment I made that Life of Pi was `` better than expected '' and received 30+ votes , it 's just got ta be one of my favourite movies . Regardless , it 's just a movie . I * pretentiously * hope you have a * pretentiously * good * pretentious * day .

1 www.youjizz.com trust me bro

1 Oh wow , yes ... holy shit that was a test of patience . Every time the scenario reset , the entire audience groaned . It was actually pretty surreal experience to watch it in a full cinema with that attitude . Terrible , TERRIBLE movie .

1 We do n't take to these sorts'a shenanigans 'round here ... * spits tobacco * No sir .

1 I saw it a few days ago . I laughed the whole time !

1 -The Guard -The General -Saltwater -Waking Ned

1 You 're not the only one . The replacement scene they used in the final product ( the shootout in Chinatown ) was just disappointingly anti-climatic .

1 No one cares what an starving African kid thinks .

1 Jane is absolutely useless ... Except for that time she jury-rigged a GPS system to manipulate space-time and killed an Infinity Stone-powered villain with his own spaceship . But that was only the last half hour of the film , easy to miss .

1 Hilariously ? ...

1 Kurt Russel is also apparently in the movie , so yea this movie cast is awesome . Also the Rock flexing out of a motherfuking arm cast .

1 Looks like a bad ass fun movie .

1 Batman . No contest . Bond is constantly squandering his energy on hot babes . Batman has way more focus . Plus , he is the night , and Bond 's only advantage is a license to kill .

1 And do n't forget the best part , redemption in spite of failure .

1 All time favorite and all time greatest are two very different things .

1 The '67 one is n't generally counted in the official canon , it was n't an Eon production .

1 Haley Joel was in there

1 Why does he misquote Val Kilmer as saying `` You can ride my tail '' , when he actually says `` You can be my wingman '' ? That 's kinda cheating .

1 Xenia Onatopp

1 They did some filming up in Canada too ! One of my friends was an extra in it during the Christmas talent show scene .

1 I almost gave an upvote

1 Mmmmm everything is better with Cumberbatchian cheekbones .

1 I love Smith 's references in all his movies back to other movies , like when they 're at the bar in Chasing Amy and talk about the girl that had sex with a dead guy .

1 He 's in Birdman directed by I ? ? rritu , it looks really good

1 Do you have any examples of this ? Because I never once felt any connection to Google in this film .

1 Because she 's doing her job by taking care of * all * of the babies , and she 's not going to drop everything she 's doing to cater to one hulked-out douchebag .

1 Best onomatopoeia ever .

1 I felt it was the other way round . There Will Be Blood is probably too heavy for the majority of people , while No Country has an accessible simplicity about it .

1 Yup. Looks like Halle Berry in a costume with a cape .

1 > She is n't very popular ~~even~~only on this sub . FTFY

1 You da real MVB .

1 Yeah , turn on some Creedence , grab some oat sodas , and spark a J. Rinse . Repeat .

1 And he would have done fine .

1 because the computer is isolated from the security ( and other ) systems ... which is why they had to break in to access it in the first place . PAY ATTENTION TO THE MOVIE .

1 Incredibles 2 is one of those things that will happen if its meant to happen . Im actually much happier Brad Bird hasnt tried to shit out a sequel for a sequel 's sake . If and when it comes , it will be GOOD .

1 I still think per-movie-average is the most impressive statistic for franchises

1 It looks better when it 's an edited shot in the actual movie . That picture is some sort of candid press shot .

1 I swear I saw Schumacher 's Bane halfway through for a split second

1 little do you know ...

1 I ca n't carry it for you , but I can carry you .

1 But how about that rack ... .

1 Often gets overlooked because it 's an old movie . But that scene where the guy is smoking the cigarette in the dark room ? Holy fuck .

1 `` The Great Outdoors '' epic John Candy movie . You will laugh your ass off .

1 Actually , I really enjoyed James Newton Howard 's collaboration with Hans Zimmer on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight . I 'm really sad that he did n't dual-score The Dark Knight Rises either . I read that because Nolan asked Zimmer to score Inception alone that he felt like `` the third wheel '' , and it 's totally understandable that he felt uncomfortable returning to score TDKR with Zimmer and Nolan 's relationship at a different level . However , it is a damn shame because TDKR 's score , while epic and quite memorable , certainly lacked the human element and the softer side that was evident in both BB and TDK ( most glaring evidence : no `` suites '' i.e. no Bane suite like there was a Harvey Dent suite [ `` Harvey Two-Face '' ] and Joker suite [ `` Why So Serious '' ] -- sure , Bane had the `` Gotham 's Reckoning '' and his theme was thrown around and Catwoman had `` Mind If I Cut In ? `` , but nothing that showed the level of maturity of the TDK suites which were complete works , which James Newton Howard definitely contributed to ) . I 'm assuming this implies in the future JNH will never work with Nolan ever again , and it makes me sad . Oh well , Zimmer is obviously just as good so it 's aight .

1 Shia Islam is quite harmless compared to Salafism .

1 That 's why Pauly Shore made Jury Duty . He identified a clear gap in public service instructional videos and decided to fill that gap with a concise , realistic portrayal of judicial procedure and jury impaneling .

1 I 'm down , Branagh knows his Shakespeare and managed to make a full film adaptation of Hamlet a great piece of cinema . Glad to see him playing with the bard again .

1 Skydiving is fine . He is referring to static-line jumping in the military , which has you landing much harder on average than you should with a steerable canopy system . Also , I have many , many static-line jumps with no back compression issues . I attribute any back pain I have to spending far too much time lugging around 100 pound rucksacks all day for years .

1 Thought the exact same thing . That 360 shot at the end in particular , it was like watching mini-Ultrons being poured into an Avengers blender , just getting ground up as soon as they got anywhere near .

1 To be or not to be . Not to be .

1 That 's a hell of a read , and successfully turned me around on the topic .

1 TWO WEEKS

1 That 's only the crowd funded part .

1 The bandwidth probably would n't allow it .

1 If you have n't listened to the soundtrack , check out the track `` mountains . '' After building to the two minute mark , there is a burst of brass creating an alert , followed by a rumbling from the cellos or some other low string interment that creates an immense sense of scale . It 's been a month since I watched the movie and I still can imagine that sequence as the camera panning upwards , capturing the immense size of the wave .

1 The One True God does n't need to explain himself . He just is .

1 It 's always been . Go to /r/worldnews , every other article has a misleading title

1 Happy Days Season 5 premiere . Fonzi jumped a shark and marked a shift in the shows tone .

1 Oh yea I 'm well aware of that fact . We laugh about it in the family bc he 's portrayed that way but actually he was one of the few who was inside the Kennedy circle . But they made him a combo character as well as just inventing stuff . Still pretty crazy though

1 I 've watched most of the Kevin Smith movies dozens of times , and they 're losing their pull with me . Clerks II is the first one that is an actual 'movie ' , with decent pacing , and the movie itself being more than just a vehicle for dick & fart jokes or clever bits of dialog . My 2 ?

1 [ The Chess scene ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=g_J4rAf2Qjg ) was probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie . The whole thing was great . The cast . The writing . The epic battles . sigh ... I need to rewatch it soon .

1 So , that 's his play .

1 Yeah , The Crow was good .

1 I saw it last night . It was terrible . Plot : After 15 minutes , you will know how it ends ( and the trailer already told you how we get there ) . The first half is decent , the second half is Origins-bad . Actors : Some supporting actors are good , most of them are terribly bad . Hugh Jackman is `` okay '' . Action : Well , it 's Wolverine . He jumps around slashing and stabbing . Most of his opponents are either handicapped or stupid .

1 * sigh * My first red flag was the drastic shift in marketing , from drama to action / thriller . I still kind of want to see it , though ...

1 Dude I 'm tired of hans Booming soundtracks . Star wars belongs to Williams the only replacement that would follow his foot steps would be giacchino . I 've already forgotten the melody of the new superman soundtrack sounded other than it was loud and booming and I remember liking it .

1 He 's barely exaggerating , there were 12 direct-to-video sequels . That 's 12 too many . I loved the first one as a kid . As for an unnecessary sequel , The Sandlot 2 . Easily my favorite sports movie as a kid and they ruined it with a crappy sequel .

1 I did n't think he sounded like Fenster so much as your typical queens / Brooklyn thug rapper . Or more so , the white guys from new Jersey and Connecticut trying to sound like those guys .

1 I agree with * Still Alice * . Julianne Moore was masterful , yet in the multiple scenes with only the two of them , Stewart continually held her ground . And , I 'm not gon na lie , I cried a lot at the end of that movie , which rarely happens , so that 's fairly impressive .

1 Why not just tell her it was actually a horror with gore in it ?

1 2 ) As someone who had abdominal surgery , I can tell you that you can definitely walk right after you recover from the anesthesia . Then again , the surgery I had only left a scar a couple inches long , not 10 like in the movie . Then again , future medicine and all . Just saying it 's not as farfetched as it seems .

1 I * LOVE * Rango ! I personally love the subplot with Rattlesnake Jake , who is my favorite character of the film . Overall its sadly overlooked .

1 I think that sometimes big hits pave the way for BIGGER hits . Like , 50 shades of grey doing so well so fast when it is clearly worse than things like Harry Potter and-yes-Twilight , the work upon which it was originally based . I think there grows a culture of `` The next Big Thing '' where originally , people are much slower to catch onto the first one and then they get easier to sway when their experience joining the mob mentality works out well for them . Not sure if I 'm being coherent , but I think that the megahit culture starts when something does really well , and then the industry streamlines to make the next megahit an even bigger hit ? I 'm sleep deprived but that 's my theory .

1 I actually meant FokJulleNaaiers X 's might have been a lucky coincidence . The use of X 's is talked about by Scorsese in the bonus features .

1 Terrible is simply untrue . Sure , they 're not the best things ever made , but you 're clearly just trying to rile people up by calling them terrible .

1 Have n't heard so mush whining since i didnt let my kid brother have that last cokie . That was 10 years ago . Grow up or go make a tinfoil hat

1 The Shining

1 Watchmen did n't have horrible ratings .

1 Aykroyd is the one who wrote those roles for those specific actors . But ya , seeing John Candy act out that possession scene outside of the restaurant would be amazing .

1 Yes . Since Kripke is n't writing like season 1-5 's storyline I thought it might take a shit , but the chemistry keeps me coming back . Plus the one liners geared to my generation . Season 8 lacked story wise but makes up for it through the chemistry .

1 Will it really ? Would I feel better if they were no-name brand cars ?

1 `` We 're not goin ' to Guam , are we Doc ... '' My favorite Lapidus line . Such a great character !

1 Yeah , I post on here all the time and discuss movies very frequently but my employer , Netflix , just called me to tell me to post Airplane ! on /r/movies . Slow your roll .

1 Looks about the same in CGI quality to me ...

1 Definitely , particularly Nashville , Short Cuts , and California Split .

1 What , like Robert DeNiro in Silver Linings Playbook , or George Clooney in The Descendants , or Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network ? Not every performance has to be a transformation , and not every actor is a character actor . Sometimes playing a role honestly and well is worthy of award . Anyhow , do you really think Barbara Weston and Julia Roberts really have that much in common ?

1 Hey , I worked on that !

1 scunthorpe i think had the edge on goole . it has more stuff happening , not good stuff but stuff .

1 There 's always someone who believes in the unbelievable .

1 But was n't the top thing not his totem ? I was under the impression that his wedding ring was , because from what I remember he was wearing his ring throughout the dreams , but at the end he was n't .

1 Marvel and Image are n't really competitors in the same way that Marvel and DC are .

1 I love In Bruges , one of the funniest movies of 2008 I reckon .

1 I actually agree . When I started this project , I did a ton a research and realized how many people do minimalist movie posters . And most of them are really boring , with a simple vector and a paper texture slapped on . I had already chosen this project for a class , though , so it was too late to change my mind .

1 It does n't matter a great deal , with the show only really having passing references , save for one pretty direct one . I guess I 'd say watch the movie first though . It will help you appreciate the show even more and vice versa .

1 Leave Blade Runner alone .

1 YOU FIXED NOTHIIIIIIIIING

1 A good pick but not quite over the top enough . Wanting to vote is kind of understandable ...

1 Zero is the one telling the story . How could he have been shot ? M. , Gustav was shot , the girl died and Zero , although successful materially , left his heart at the Grand Budapest .

1 at least it is n't the purple costume

1 > Hagrid was close , but was n't quite rugged enough . That 's funny because JK Rowling said she wrote Hagrid with Robbie Coltrane in mind . I think the actor was exactly what she was going for . http : / harrypotter.wikia.com / wiki / Robbie_Coltrane `` Robbie mainly took the role of Rubeus Hagrid because his children , Alice and Spencer , pressured him into it . He also wished to do it , because J. K. Rowling only wanted him for the part . ''

1 Watch `` Running with Scissors '' It 's a really good movie and better book . But it get at the feels .

1 yeah fuck that guy

1 The Oscars are one of the only reasons why a lot of our favorite movies are made . If the Oscars did n't matter , big budget studios would never greenlight non-blockbuster projects . The reason they matter is two-fold . 1 . Pride . Its another metric that Producers / Studios use to measure the quality of their portfolio . 2 . Money . As soon as your film , director actor , etc . receive a golden statue , its an immediate $ $ $ bump . It can be plastered on DVDs / Blurays , included in trailers for their future movies , etc . Winning an Oscar matters to the bottom line .

1 The same point applies , Hollywood studios like to copy each other

1 I am upvoting you because I think it takes real guts to admit to liking that festering pile of a film .

1 Howard The Duck was * NOT * considered great in its time .

1 Honestly I took one look at Colin Firth on that poster and thought `` romantic spy comedy '' . Then there was the scene in the church ... Colin Firth was * awesome *

1 Also the scene where Pippin is afraid of dying and Gandalf tells him what it 's like . I cry manly Old Yeller / Field of Dreams tears every time .

1 And the warden is the wierd german guy from the first film .

1 Just because there are `` bigger '' problems in the world does n't mean we ca n't focus on others as well . Besides , you 're on reddit right now . Like you were doing anything to save the world with your time .

1 Which is weird , because the guy is Irish , and I just watched him in an Irish movie , `` What Richard Did . ''

1 The second Mighty Ducks where they face off against the evil Iceland team is my favorite .

1 I 'm gon na have to agree with The Dreamers scenes .

1 Or low-concept Romeo & Juliet . `` Highness '' is subjective .

1 He did n't say it was a pitch . He said specifically he never had a full pitch in fact .

1 I saw that movie with my dad when I was like 10 . He goes `` that was lame she could 've said something better than that ''

1 because that 's totally what Bane wears . a mesh vest , a black camisole , and denim shorts . he was so badass .

1 Wait people hate a bugs life say what

1 I thought it was a sock .

1 Cheesy but magical ! Sacred Power of Raging Winds is my favorite appearance of his .

1 Ca n't believe you managed Silmarillion , but not LotR . Every time this comes up I 'm confused . I read them when I was 11 ...

1 Depends on how you look at it . Speech styles and labguage are taken directly from radio / television / media per the first one . So the transformers who are stereotypes / racist are more accurately a reflection of our own racism that is present . Jazz in the first one I thought demonstrated that well . He chose to emulate the behavior he aligned with which was largely a rapper / thug style . Now of course the irony is the overtly stereotyped black Jazz is the only autobot to die . Insuring the black guy dies trope . Main point though , implying racism onto non-race creatures are actually a reflection of the audiences racism and if done correctly can point out some huge cultural issues . Done correctly ... district 9 . Done poorly ... jar jar bink 's ...

1 Snyder or Goyer ( I forget ) said that it 's a sequel to MoS . I 'm sure they 'll give Batman equal screen time and make it more of a Batman and Superman marquee , but `` officially '' I 'm considering it MoS 2 .

1 Cheers for the info . I was intrigued to find out how truthful their claim was about the safe words , but I really could n't be arsed to read the book itself .

1 Okay , that is interesting . Still the lengths he went to to achieve these effects was pretty impressive : http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Barry_Lyndon # Cinematography

1 Unions .

1 I do n't know , man . The HFr made it look like I was watching play being acted out . The whole time , it looked like a bunch of actors in costume running around CGI . With all the clarity , you can start to see makeup and prosthetics and special effects much easier , so it broke immersion for me .

1 I love mostly everything of Whedon 's that I have watched , except Agents of Shield , but I agree with you on this . A massive personality flaw is not being able to accept criticism or responsibility and although it 's usually wrong to suggest you know what a celebrity 's personality is like , I 'm pretty sure we 've got enough evidence on Whedon to know this to be true .

1 It kinda worked well , too , having shaky video in the Districts , where people are poor , then it stabilized in the Capitol , where people are rich , then it kinda ran in the middle for the arena .

1 Have you seen Dead Snow 1+2 ? They are pretty good .

1 SK : He 's behind you Mercenary : Who ? Batman : ME !

1 Severe lack of U2 in the trailer .

1 You 've got red on you *

1 I would be interested in watching Jesse and Celine 's other relationships during that time .

1 Now I understand the comparisons to Meet the Robinsons . Which is a movie I really enjoyed .

1 Pedantic people are usually only pedantic when they want to be right on the internet , in my experience .

1 I haven ? t watched that film in a few years , but it really is a beautiful example of Kurosawa and Japanese filmmaking . The imagery is intensely powerful and I love that Scorcese is in it !

1 > There are directors that purposely put limitations upon themselves ( see dogma films ) . A better example would be Hitchock 's `` problem films '' . He would set for himself a technical problem and build a film around it . So in * Read Window * the camera never leaves the apartment . In * Rope * we get one continuous take , no cuts ( except when the film ran out ) . * Lifeboats * has the camera at one level .

1 I just laughed out loud at an Amadeus joke on a crowded bus . Nice one !

1 I saw that as post-cocaine Carrie Fisher .

1 [ This good ] ( http : / imgur.com / wda6YEE )

1 They 've expanded past Austin too and from what I understand all of them are very very strict on the no talking / texting stuff .

1 That part blew my mind too . For some reason the only line that stuck in my head was when he called his brother his `` big-little brother '' .

1 I get the tinglies from the part before they go shoot up the building to save Morpheus , when Neo and Trinity are standing in the white space and all the racks of guns come sliding into place .

1 The Beatles taking drugs ? Why I 'd never !

1 Yeah man , if you just take it for what it is , a fun movie about heroism . Then its great . If you begin to nitpick it falls apart quick . But I love it .

1 No . A `` dark and gritty '' Mario makes * much more less * sense than a `` dark and gritty '' Superman .

1 It is an absolute crappy movie if not watched properly . I luckily had the change to watch it on screen , and I still am mind blown by the overall experience

1 I do n't think you 've seen the movie .

1 Best shot in a movie in a very long time

1 Still ghostbusters .

1 'Dementions ' . Go home , Mike Tyson ; you 're getting too philosophisicalic .

1 I am serious , and do n't call me Shirley .

1 thx .

1 read it in his voice . good use of droll

1 They need someone to save the movie .

1 In the original Broadway production the costume for the wolf has a penis . The song uses eating her as a metaphor for rape .

1 Holden was insane in a way that made sense , and he achieved this with such simplicity that reading it gave me insights into myself and reawakened a bunch of feelings in me .

1 And not a single mention of actual salaries in the article ... hmmm .

1 That 's pretty fucking hip of you .

1 Darth Kryat was right on that one . I always found it weird when he was talking to the Sith Holocron , that all the Sith Masters he talked to gave him shit about abandoning the rule of two , even the ones who never lived during it 's implementation .

1 So ? Plenty of Kaiju and mecha in cinema and anime change size for dramatic effect . In Neon Genesis Evagelion the Evas change size dramatically , but no one ever complains .

1 It 's also a 'feel cool ' movie as well .

1 This would be better if it included the shot .

1 Because he brings in money just by slapping his name on it . EDIT : He 's got talent in bringing his audience what they want .

1 That 's fair but most of those parts are supposed to be depressing for at least a bit . The dark , humorous parts are there though . I think of it as art-house done right ( and high budget ) , whimsical , colorful , offbeat , oddly endearing with dreamlike soundtracks . I get where they 're coming from but its not at the top of the descriptions list for me .

1 I give you my blessing , Nick Offerman .

1 Ok , there 's so much wrong with everything you 're saying . `` thank you euro 's for taking her away from us '' ? She lives in Manhattan . `` Pretty much the article '' did not nail it . It got facts wrong .

1 I thought the performances were spot on , but I hated the movie because it had no idea what it wanted to be . Considering the cast involved , there was no excuse for the mostly humorless and dramatic start and then it flopped around between zombie movie , drama and comedy without finding much of a middle ground . It was a toneless , jumbled mess and a waste of a great cast and premise .

1 This is what I tell everybody .

1 This will get a lot of hate . I 'm fine with it . I 'm not foolish enough to believe all these additions will be major players in the movie . They will be cameos or very brief introductions or simple nods to let us know who is coming . They might be hot-shotting a bit so they can push the Justice League movie out , but I trust they 'll do at least a decent job and not cause a jam . Unfortunately people are looking to hate on this movie so they will grab every opportunity to do so .

1 Thank you for that . It 's interesting watching the camera work moving in-sync with the punches being thrown . I 've never seen an action scene feel that kinetic before .

1 The Nolan Batman films just got worse as we moved from Begin to Rises . Begins was great , Knight was good and saved by a solid performance from Ledger , and Rises was so meh and disappointing .

1 VICE tries so , so hard to be relevant .

1 Why do they have to clap and scream after every fucking line ?

1 The first Spider-man movie came out 13 years ago and is considered a classic of the genre . OP asked for what films this has happened to already , not for you to make snarky comments about a genre you do n't particularly enjoy .

1 Well that has literally nothing to do with it . Marvel green lit it . Wright , the director , never got it off the ground .

1 Magnolia ! What 's not to love about this ? Such a wildly engaging opening - and to end the opening with `` These strange things happen all the time '' ! makes it an absolutely perfect introduction to the rest of this masterpiece . Narrator : In the New York Herald , November 26 , year 1911 , there is an account of the hanging of three men . They died for the murder of Sir Edmund William Godfrey ; Husband , Father , Pharmacist and all around gentle-man resident of : Greenberry Hill , London . He was murdered by three vagrants whose motive was simple robbery . They were identified as : Joseph Green , Stanley Berry , and Daniel Hill . Green , Berry , Hill . And I Would Like To Think This was Only A Matter Of Chance . As reported in the Reno Gazette , June of 1983 there is the story of a fire , the water that it took to contain the fire , and a scuba diver named Delmer Darion . Employee of the Peppermill Hotel and Casino , Reno , Nevada . Engaged as a blackjack dealer . Well liked and well regarded as a physical , recreational and sporting sort , Delmer 's true passion was for the lake . As reported by the coroner , Delmer died of a heart attack somewhere between the lake and the tree . A most curious side note is the suicide the next day of Craig Hansen . Volunteer firefighter , estranged father of four and a poor tendency to drink . Mr. Hansen was the pilot of the plane that quite accidentally lifted Delmer Darion out of the water . Added to this , Mr. Hansen 's tortured life met before with Delmer Darion just two nights previous . The weight of the guilt and the measure of coincidence so large , Craig Hansen took his life . And I Am Trying To Think This Was All Only A Matter Of Chance . The tale told at a 1961 awards dinner for the American Association Of Forensic Science by Dr. Donald Harper , president of the association , began with a simple suicide attempt . Seventeen-year-old Sydney Barringer . In the city of Los Angeles on March 23 , 1958 . The coroner ruled that the unsuccessful suicide had suddenly become a successful homicide . To explain : The suicide was confirmed by a note , left in the breast pocket of Sydney Barringer . At the same time young Sydney stood on the ledge of this nine-story building , an argument swelled three stories below . The neighbors heard , as they usually did , the arguing of the tenants and it was not uncommon for them to threaten each other with a shotgun , or one of the many handguns kept in the house . And when the shotgun accidentaly went off , Sydney just happend to pass . Added to this , the two tenants turned out to be : Faye and Arthur Barringer . Sydney 's mother and Sydney 's father . When confronted with the charge , which took some figuring out for the officers on the scene of the crime , Faye Barringer swore that she did not know that the gun was loaded . A young boy who lived in the building , sometimes a visitor and friend to Sydney Barringer , said that he had seen , six days prior , the loading of the shotgun . It seems that the arguing and the fighting and all of the violence was far too much for Sydney Barringer , and knowing his mother and father 's tendency to fight , he decided to do something . Sydney Barringer jumps from the ninth floor rooftop . His parents argue three stories below . Her accidental shotgun blast hits Sydney in the stomach as he passes the arguing sixth-floor window . He is killed instantly but continues to fall , only to find , three stories below , a safety net installed three days prior for a set of window washers that would have broken his fall and saved his life if not for the hole in his stomach . So Faye Barringer was charged with the murder of her son , and Sydney Barringer noted as an accomplice in his own death . And it is in the humble opinion of this narrator that this is not just `` Something That Happened . '' This can not be `` One of Those Things ... `` This , please , can not be that . And for what I would like to say , I ca n't . This Was Not Just A Matter Of Chance . Ohhhh . These strange things happen all the time .

1 A terrible idea . Just terrible . Why would you remake Taxi Driver ?

1 I was so inspired and ready to try acting until that bit about remembering the lines , then I was like , nope shit 's hard man .

1 she 's bulking

1 Six fucking gifs for one little thing like this ? Jesus , that was annoying .

1 His name was Darkness and he was brilliantly played by Tim Curry .

1 I think the main problem with * Ender 's Game * was that it felt thematically different than the novel . I imagine a lot of people -- myself included -- walked into the theater hoping to relive the coming-of-age story they grew up with , and they got a much more cold , objective commentary on war and society . At the same time , they kept the movie close enough to the original story that the plot did n't totally stand on its own . It was n't a movie for people who 'd read the novel and it was n't a movie for people who had n't . I agree that it was overall a fine movie undermined by expectations , but it was also legitimately a bit flimsy .

1 That 's definitely what Brokeback Mountain is about .

1 He did n't , he assumed that since it did n't Make 700mil and got some bad reviews it was a flop it in fact made a little over double ( almost triple ) it 's budget which considering it was basically a privately funded movie is pretty good in my opinion

1 I do n't think it 's fair to excuse Moses and the Egyptians being cast with white actors and complain about Akira being white-washed . One , regardless of what demographic you are trying to appease , whitewashing history ( and while I 'm aware that Exodus is n't history , Egyptian 's certainly were ) seems more blatantly offensive than retelling a completely fictional story . Kids will walk away from that movie thinking the most famous empire in African history was actually white , and in a country with as many racial issues as America , that 's a problem . Two , it shows the same amount of disregard for the source material that an all-white Akira cast shows . And disregarding the source material is rarely a good sign for a quality adaptation . And three , they come from the same root . The same rationale for making an all white Exodus cast is more than likely the thinking behind a white Akira one .

1 Honestly , just read 2001 and 2010 . It ties up most of the loose ends . 3001 basically explains everything , including who / what built the monoliths .

1 Have him watch Dead Snow

1 What are you doing on reddit , you have more important things to do .

1 It seems this one wants a bit of the ol ' in-out , in-out .

1 No in the two-part first episode of Batman Beyond he uses the suit Terry nicks later in that episode . It 's the one with the red logo not blue . Wayne does have some heart issues in that episode in the first scenes while rescuing a kidnap victim . Also interesting to note that Wayne is already old in the first scene but even older when Terry enters the picture . They do n't indicate the time difference but cars and such differ a lot . Way more futuristic .

1 Non-Lucas examples ?

1 Thats like telling someone who just lost their job that they can have a prestegious position at their local mcdonalds . No .

1 Upvote for rome . Such an amazing show with amazing production value and acting .

1 Ok

1 Diane Lane gets her brains fucked out in that one . Very graphic .

1 probably his older brother 's outfit too

1 `` Magical Realism '' is the term you 're looking for and my absolute favorite genre ! Combining fantastical elements in a realistic settings makes the magic feel all the more tangible and effecting ! Here 's some of the best : * * Charlie Kaufman * ( Adaptation , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , Being John Malkovich ) * * Beasts of the Southern Wild * * * The Fall * * * Life of Pi * * * Pan 's Labyrinth * * * Curious Case of Benjamin Button * * Most * Miyazaki * , * Lynch * , * Cronenberg * , * Jean-Pierre Jeunet * , * Lars von Trier * , * Tim Burton * , * Alfonso Cuaron *

1 The second one is my favorite film of all time . To each his own : )

1 almost like this is n't a standard movie ... wait a minute

1 Do n't worry , Nic Cage will play the role of your son in the movie adaptation of his life .

1 Not in 1995 or whenever this movie is supposed to take place

1 God damn , Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae , as an actor playing a character it does n't get any better .

1 `` I am not a gangster , I am a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine ''

1 Or V 's speech to the two inspectors at the children 's memorial when he 's explaining the whole backstory to McCreedy and the Norsefire Party .

1 And this is the flip side of what an effective troll is

1 I always assumed the Matrix sequels were shit because those were the ones that the Wachowskis wrote themselves , whereas the first one was them ripping off a bunch of stuff .

1 Nope ... He will play Anduin in Warcraft . Koba was played by Toby Kebbell .

1 You probably were n't following film very closely in 2006 .

1 Right . People think you can teach somebody to sing in a few months of voice lessons . Maybe you can make them pretty good , not bad , hit the notes , but nothing like a talented pro .

1 There was an `` oral history '' on the making of Pulp Fiction . The cast and crew kept forgetting how much longer John Travolta had been in the industry compared to everyone else . People would bring up some obscure 70 's TV star ( from the perspective of their childhood ) as a joke only for Travolta to pipe in that he dated that person during their heyday .

1 The movie with only extras hired .

1 or It Follows for that matter

1 Really ? I thought that was as upbeat an ending the setting could reasonably allow . Maybe more so .

1 That was pretty damn funny

1 What 's incomprehensible about it . There 's a mole in the outfit and the fact that Smilie was ousted sometime ago makes him the perfect guy to track down the mole . He does this by pulling in some of the less senior agents as they could n't be the mole due to a lack of access to intel . He eventually untangles a web of lies , deceptions , murders and set-ups to get to the truth .

1 Well I know what I 'm doing this reading week : D

1 It was n't even really supposed to be released to the public , it was something they put together for the announcement event of their future movies for the fans and media , and someone secretly recorded it . All the footage was from past movies , except for the bits with the Gauntlet itself and Thanos .

1 But that 's not what Kubrick 's version of the story is about . It 's about a person who is * already * susceptible to the `` possession '' of the Overlook -- because he 's already `` dark '' : Excessive drinking , bouts of violence like breaking his son 's arm , sneaking looks at attractive women behind his wife 's back , arrogantly sneering at his spouse 's ignorance , etc . As always , Kubrick knows more about the human condition / psychology that King . King 's great at narrative structure , but kind of a dope when it comes to dialogue and `` true '' characterizations .

1 The whole film said Hill was a bad guy , but not that bad . It ended with him hating his life as a nobody while everyone else was in prison . In the end no-one won .

1 Primer Upstream Color Triangle Blue Ruin

1 It kind of has Morgan Freeman in it , but hes more of a Deity than human at this point , so i would say this counts

1 I enjoyed it , if you like their other movies then you will probably like it

1 Cause you went to community college .

1 I know ! Me too ! I 'll show you mine and you ... .. ahh , forget it . I 'm bored of it already .

1 I meant that the two I 'm talking about are of a better quality and this one wo n't have the same magic as them

1 I guess you could say you had to ... get going ?

1 The cuss you say ?

1 Paul Dano ? Wrong . He was snubbed for good reason . He is not a bad actor , but was horribly miscast . Daniel Day Lewis was doing laps around that kid , and it really stuck out . Quintin agrees . On the subject of The Big Lebowski , I think that John Goodman 's snub of best supporting actor was more significant than Jeff Bridges ' best actor snub .

1 It 's just so much fun when he shows anger . It 's rare but he does it so well .

1 Dredd , Greatest Of All Time

1 Your smugness worries me .

1 The same way my teacher bullied me into learning maths , and the cop bullied me into taking a ticket . We can throw the word bully around inappropriately all you want , does not make your point any better .

1 Totally a spoiler - especially if you watch it enough to note each scene - and they do essentially tell you the story ( spoilers ahead ) : The trailer itself covers the fact they find a map , they go , the place is deserted ( or so they think ) but wait - something is alive . Whatever is controlling the ship decides back to Earth and by the way , the scientists were wrong . If they ca n't stop the ship , there wo n't be an Earth to return to . The ship Prometheus is then shown a ) airborne and b ) crashing in to something . That 's essentially the main plot of the film right there . Do n't get me wrong , it 's a beautiful trailer . But it did n't exactly hold a lot back .

1 But if it went for the same formula as the last film , people would complain over lack of originality . It seems like they 're trying to tell an interesting story while providing thrilling action , I ca n't wait .

1 He 's saying it 's mathematically difficult to map a person 's face to a dragon 's face because there is so much uncertainty while calibrating that you might as well just do it yourself .

1 /r/movies dude . MOVIES .

1 If those theatre owners owned more IMAX screens , it would be illegal . The reason it is n't is that more than 20 % of IMAX screens are not owned by these guys . If they owned more , this would be collusion , and would be illegal .

1 It 's a theory . You know for shits and giggles , it 's not cannon or anything .

1 Yeah , what they really needed is to pan out and just show an orgy of people fucking hardcore just outside of the camera 's view

1 Joker : Do I really look like a guy with a plan ? You know what I am ? I 'm a dog chasing cars . I would n't know what to do with one if I caught it . You know , I just ... do things . The mob has plans , the cops have plans , Gordon 's got plans . You know , they 're schemers . Schemers trying to control their little worlds . I 'm not a schemer . I try to show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are . So , when I say ... Ah , come here . ( He takes Dent 's hand into his own ) Joker : When I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal , you know that I 'm telling the truth . It 's the schemers that put you where you are . You were a schemer , you had plans , and look where that got you . ( Dent tries to grab the Joker . ) Joker : I just did what I do best . I took your little plan and I turned it on itself .

Upset the established order , and everything becomes chaos . I 'm an agent of chaos . Oh , and you know the thing about chaos ? It 's fair ! ( still holding the gun , Two-Face pauses and takes out his half-scarred coin . ) Two-Face : ( shows the clean side ) You live . Joker : Mm-hmm . Two-Face : ( shows the scarred side ) You die .

1 Yes he was . Everyone was bad in that movie .

1 The interesting thing about the extended version is that it does n't have very many scenes that were not in the theatrical version ; rather , each scene from the theatrical version has been expanded with more detail and dialogue that was cut for time from the theatrical release . To put it musically ( which seems appropriate ) : The theatrical version is the studio song , more tightly paced , while the extended version is more like a longer live version of the same song , exploring the corners of each scene .

1 They had bigger budgets than they want us to think : (

1 Peter O'Toole died without ever winning an Oscar and he 's one of the best to ever do it . I think people need to give the DiCaprio thing a rest . It 's not like he 's the best actor to never win . I struggle to think of a year where DiCaprio was in contention and actually deserved to win over another nominee .

1 Does n't mean it 's anywhere near the best .

1 What genre do you think home alone is.. = / Not quite sure how it could be anything other than a comedy

1 Incorrect ! That too was Robert Duvall . In a classic showbiz twist , he lost the Academy Award but won an Emmy for his performance as Ellen Burnstyn at the Oscar ceremony .

1 I 've always enjoyed his stuff . I listened to an interview with him the other day ( Interviewer was Marc Maron ) and he was just so humble . He seems so grateful for the work he gets and appreciative of the people that help him along the way . I ca n't wait to see what he does in the future .

1 If it 's done on purpose , it 's not exactly a mistake .

1 It 's got Chloe Moretz and they 're using the source material to film extra scenes . I hate remakes like the next guy , but this MIGHT be better than your average fare of remakes .

1 Summer School is a solid 2 star movie . Maybe even 2.5 . And Jason X is probably rated correctly nut yeah . It knew what it was , unlike 8 and 9 .

1 Nice try , Pepsi counter-marketing intern .

1 but thats the definition of something being funny to him ... we are dealing with an entirely subjective criteria , for christ sake some people find Dane Cook funny . just because its not a particular brand of comedy that you buy into doesnt mean that anyone that does is a social lemming who is going to laugh themselves off a cliff . family guy is one of the most popular shows on television and that is , in no small part , thanks to seth mcfarlane and so while you might not find it particularly enjoyable and while some of it might be painfully derivative dont dismiss the entire fan base as merely being tricked into laughing .

1 Imagine getting caught with this movie . Would anyone risk that ?

1 Lol no they were n't .

1 What plot holes exactly ? Also I loved the fight scenes and in fairness you ca n't make a low budget CGI . I like how little it was used . From what I can tell the budget was around about ? 12,000,000 , Hot Fuzz had a budget of 8 mil and Shaun had 4 mil I felt the film was very British , all it took from Scott Pilgrim was the choreography of the fight scenes . Edit : still waiting on a reply

1 The first book was the best of them . It 's like a lot of thought was put into the first and the rest were just `` well , I want to write a trilogy , so let 's see what I can fit in . '' The 4th ( prequel ) just was n't very good at all . I 'm still not sure why I forced myself to trudge though them all .

1 > Also , pretending it is a loss means the movie companies and the shell companies that also claim a loss do n't pay what they should in taxes . I 'm sorry , but this is just plain wrong . You 're either very uninformed or ill-informed in the area of accounting and tax . The companies `` pretend it is a loss '' only in the context of * internal * accounting , i.e. how they portray the performance of a movie and use that performance when paying / not paying people based on performance contracts . * This is completely separate from tax-basis accounting * which is how the company must legally record revenues and expenses for taxation purposes and report this to the IRS . The company 's total revenue and total expenses * do not change at all * due to Hollywood accounting , it 's only the way the total revenue and expenses is distributed that changes .

1 Or . You know . Just have an opinion . Bale was great , but I prefer Keaton .

1 I found the part at the end about Maxivision very interesting . I 've grown to like Roger Ebert more and more , with time . His Blu-Ray commentary for the Dark City Director 's Cut really sold me on him as a critic ; one of the best I 've listened to .

1 There was n't even an awning on that block . They just jumped 20 stories .

1 You realize Gunn only directed 1 skit that played during the credits of that movie , right ? Movie 43 took almost a decade to make and there were 15 different directors . Maybe do some research rather than looking at Wikipedia before you comment .

1 I hope Rocky does n't go the way of Mickey . It would be too much for me to have lost Mickey , Apollo , and then Rocky . : (

1 American Beauty may have been tamer than Happiness , but it was still very frank about taboo subjects for its time . The Academy tends to stay away from darker , edgier stuff , so this was actually a nice surprise when it won .

1 What ? No . [ Average male height ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Human_height # Average_height_around_the_world ) in the U.S. for men over 20 is 5'9.5 '' . That puts Jon Stewart 4.5 '' shorter than average and Tarantino 3.5 '' taller than average . Jon Stewart is only a bit above average if your population sample is Jewish men . Not really fair to compare Tarantino to that demographic as he is n't Jewish ( as far as I can tell ) .

1 Yeah , I can confirm that .

1 Steve Jobs at that age looked exactly like Ashton Kutcher .

1 I did n't have too much problem with the hedgehog scene as it was a nice way of showing that he had `` become enamored of many of the beasts and birds . '' My main concern was with the bird shit as well as how he seemed to be portrayed as an absent minded old man ( ie . the whole `` why was I here '' scene ) . I just felt that he had been overdone and that everything about him had been taken to the extreme . But then again , if he had been done somewhat correctly I guess he would n't have been a very memorable character : )

1 I think the title refers to all of the characters . There 's literal prisoners , like the girls and Alex . But then there 's more figurative prisons for the parents and Loki . Like prisons of emotions / ego / whatever is driving them .

1 Masamune was n't involved in S.A.C . That was mostly I.G . and Kenji Kamiyama . I was pretty much talking about his Galgrease stuff .

1 I saw it at midnight when it came out . It was pretty damn funny and it was actually lengthy for a comedy . I 'd give it a 8 / 10 . One of the funnier comedies in recent memory .

1 Kinda look burn-victimish .

1 No , just one that does n't care about it being a about a black 007 and not talent

1 Huh ? It 's correct . Trust me .

1 The opening credits would have been his funeral .

1 Spaceballs is great but I feel like you have n't seen Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein in order to say that it 's Mel Brooks at the top of his game .

1 Meg even more so

1 Instead of a photograph , you got a long-exposure of the entirety of several empires .

1 It 's not the best movie posters , it 's the movie posters for the highest grossing films .

1 I highly recommend watching Star Wars : The Clone Wars . Throughout the show ( especially in the last arc of season 5 ) , Anakin gradually loses his trust in the Jedi Order , which does explain at least partially why he 's so emotional in Ep . III .

1 It very slyly avoids all kinds of cliches you would expect from a coming-of-age drama . I think Shailene Woodley gives one of the finest performances of the year .

1 No , they could totally have a crossover . They 're pretty much targeting the same audience now that the original generation who watched spy kids would all be old enough to watch Machete now .

1 No doubt it will only be a matter of time before it 's reported that Bryan Cranston , Mark Strong , Terry O'Quinn and every other actor with a bald head who 's been linked to Lex Luthor is said to be EON 's favourite for the role .

1 No .

1 King apparently really liked the film 's ending . I 'm not sure the ending he wrote would have been any more satisfying .

1 The line must be drawn HYAHHH !

1 I know you 're getting downvoted , but I do n't see why . I like Nolan 's blockbusters a lot , but his earlier films that were smaller and far more nuanced are my favorites , and I kinda wish he 'd go alternate between 200 million dollar blockbusters and still do some smaller movies , but there 's no way that 'll happen unless he has a couple bombs in a row .

1 Considering she does n't have much of a career . The only noticeable thing about her is that she is super attractive..and from Israel .

1 Fuck yeah . John Woo rules .

1 I 'm not ? Just going to see the film and enjoy it .

1 Yes , that would be the reference .

1 That movie has a lot of sentimental value to me . It was the movie I watched damn near every day as a little kid . And at the time , my dad was ( and still is ) a huge Jim Carrey fan , and he always loved him as the Riddler , so I guess it just rubbed off . I still love that movie , though .

1 > now I am embarassed to call him a friend Now this is just stupid.. .. how dare he to enjoy the movie that you do n't ? !

1 My god ... . you need to pitch this to Universal ...

1 Test screenings probably . People like happy endings .

1 I work in family law . It 's pretty much an extremely accurate depiction of the process and how awful it is . I cite it because all three main actors in it were spectacular . But I agree , it 's awful to watch and I 'll probably never watch it again .

1 We all give the guy hate for his later movies , but you need to remember that when The Happening came out he had made a couple of pretty successful movies .

1 MY CABBAGES !

1 How ? The main character neglected his wife and kids , saw people murdered in the street , saw friends get killed , almost beat a dog because he was emotionally damaged then got murdered . Not exactly `` hurrah ! Go America ! War is great ! ''

1 Because people like it and want to see it ?

1 I think Michael Bay just changed his name to `` Scorsese . '' That 's the only plausible explanation I can think of .

1 No ... it 's not like that at all .

1 At least the fight scenes in the Matrix were cool

1 Total mindfuck

1 I had a post in a thread a handful of months ago helping to explain my understanding of it , so I 'll just paste that into here lol . my explanation : There is an event that causes a tear in the logic and fabric that makes up the universe . This happens when the engine crashes into his room and has no explanation . The rest of the movie is a series of events surrounding Donnie that lead him to save the universe . This is a bit much , but it is all based around him as he is the one most directly involved with the tear since it leads to something crashing into his room and all . When this event happens the universe starts to breakdown ... the world ending in about 28 days if I remember right . During this time of physics falling apart Frank is killed ... but since he is killed during this time he can still move around and interact with things a bit since the rules are n't working so well anymore . This is especially true to Donnie , who is basically tuned to sense all this since he is closest to the event . In order to save everything he needs to give the event an explanation , and restore an order to things . The whole movie is about him wrestling with understanding purpose and divine providence , while everything around him is either giving him reasons ( like saving his girlfriend ) or the the tools to do so ( conversations with frank , and the book the about time travel he finds ) . He floods the school to meet the girl which plays into this . He burns the house so others have to be with sparkle motion , so they can have the party , so his girlfriend gets killed , so frank gets killed , so frank can help him save the world . He sends the engine back through a time portal to save everything , and in doing so he recognizes the elaborate and beautiful scheme that has allowed him to do this . He has peered behind the curtain of the universe and thus is smiling at the end even though he knows that he must end as part of it . Everyone else feels the changed timeline like an echo during the ending . When Gretchen says `` Donnie Darko , sounds like a super hero or something . '' Donnie tellingly replies `` what makes you think I 'm not . '' IIRC .

1 Not * really * . Die Hard is based on a book called Nothing Lasts Forever , which was a sequel to a book titled The Detective . The Detective was [ turned into a movie ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / The_Detective_ ( 1968_film ) in 1968 , starring Frank Sinatra . When they had originally planned Die Hard , they were wanting to film it with Frank Sinatra as Joe Leland ( John McClane 's name in the books ) . Frank Sinatra denied the role , and they re-wrote it to be a sequel to Commando . Then Arnold turned * that * down , and it became the Die Hard we know today .

1 `` * LAAAAW * ? WHAT * LAAAAAAW * ! ? ''

1 It 's like the reverse of the `` hot girl average guy '' stereotype .

1 Ridley Scott , with his highly-trained and remarkable painterly `` eye , '' was able to redefine the look of science fiction films TWICE : First , in `` Alien '' he gave the world the `` blue collar '' workingman 's spaceship , defined by grime , utility , a sense of cluttered lived-in-ness , and claustrophobia ; which he combined with something that truly * was * `` alien '' in concept : The H.R . Giger-designed sexual-metaphor-creatures and offworld artifacts -- a style of creature-design that has since been riffed-on in lesser movies dozens of times . Then , in `` Blade Runner , '' he gave us the future as polyglot retrofitted ultra-metropolitan neo-noir . And , again , almost all futurist imagery ( if it is n't tilting towards the Kubrickian white / clean / minimalist look ) tends to bow to Scott 's patched-up and over-built multicultural cityscapes .

1 Fuck Movie 43 .

1 I just get annoyed by lazy dismissals of quality films . Which is something all too prevalent around /r/movies .

1 Looking at the RT score right now , I 'm guessing they did a lot of troll deleting ? Christian trolls , what a funny , and accurate , thought .

1 Yes he does . Because her reply is `` I 'm the cunt you married . '' EDIT : Nick Dunne : You fucking cunt ! Amy Dunne : I 'm the cunt you married . The only time you liked yourself was when you were trying to be someone this cunt might like . I 'm not a quitter , I 'm that cunt . I killed for you ; who else can say that ? You think you 'd be happy with a nice Midwestern girl ? No way , baby ! I 'm it .

1 Right , while a perfectly good movie about a character overcoming his personal insecurities , it did n't strike me as very ... important . Even though it was about his giving the country hope . I agree , I liked the Fighter better as well . It had much more impact behind it . In fact , out of all 10 Best Picture nominees that year , I probably enjoyed The King 's Speech the least .

1 That whole movie from start to finish was a cringe for me , I thought it was way overrated .

1 That 's the same for The Verge , most of the well known gaming sites and Gawker media . People just think it 's click bait ? but there 's genuinely people on the most extreme left ? that think everything is to do with race and gender .

1 Right , not new at all . There are still discussions accessible online from 2002 / 3 concerning the ending being a dream ( I participated in many of them ) .

1 * NO *

1 3 minutes for a joke that 's been on the internet since The Last Airbender came out ? I would say I am disappoint , but then again this is collegehumor we 're talking about .

1 That pretty decent dragon will look awful when composited with live action . The technology for CGI continually advances . We still have yet to overcome the uncanny valley . Now , dragons are easier than humans because we do n't have the same expectations and familiarity , but do n't for a moment think that there is n't still a long way to go .

1 I was really hyped for this one but in the end I was so terribly disappointed . This is largely due to the brother and his sister who are incredibly unlikeable .

1 Well he did say that they would be cruel to the germans : \

1 I think it would help if he stopped getting his brother to write the screenplays .

1 This is for everyone who thinks you 're a douche ... .

1 I remember sitting in disbelief at that one , thinking `` did I hear rightly ? '' and `` how come no-one else picked up on it ? ''

1 Not as bad as a guy I worked with that would refer to Tetris when training new employees .

1 Mia talking with Brian before he left . They used a lot of scenes of the back on Brian 's head when Mia talked . Them showed his face every time he talked . The phone convo was recut as well . Did n't seem to flow very well together .

1 I loved that movie , but I 've still only seen it once because I never really feel like spending 3 hours watching The Deer Hunter .

1 Best line in a movie that had dozens of amazing quotes

1 Would you mind not posting that , please ?

1 Yeah , but he 's also a `` superhero '' in a superhero-style comic , where that 's extremely normal . It does have depth , to say that it does n't is glossing over a lot . It explores themes of obsession , grief , vanity , violence , and loss . And a lot more . Nothing shows `` everything Batman is '' except for 70-some years of Batman comics .

1 I think Tangled was , like a lot of other Disney movies , in production for a hell of a long time , going through a lot of stylistic changes ( originally being the more traditional fairytale , and being called Rapunzel ) before they eventually reworked it to be more of a Shrek-style movie that targeted boys as well as girls . IIRC it 's one of the most expensive movies ever created as a result .

1 Christopher Nolan 's Insomnia was pretty good IMO .

1 Apple had all the early release promos and trailers for Into Darkness as well . They probably paid decent money for it .

1 Not to mention the subsequent callback to the first guy , who it turns out is still very much alive -- and armed . But when the villain aims to shoot , we see Bond kill him , and turn into 007 , through the barrel of the dead man 's gun . Segues into `` You Know My Name , '' but it 's not until the very last shot of the film that we hear him say `` Bond . James Bond . ''

1 I think she was trying to pronounce it with a more Japanese accent .

1 Interstellar is kind of strange . I thought the resolution of the film was rather lazy , and something I actually predicted at the beginning of the movie . In that sense , I actually hated it - everything up to the black hole was great and then I loathed every second . Yet I find myself talking about it and defending a lot of aspects of the movie ( i.e. sending the ranger up from Earth on a rocket - they would have done that to conserve fuel for the mission so it makes perfect sense ) . So , in that sense I loved it .

1 My years of reading ai n't it cool news leads me to believe that every movie will make me cum repeatedly . Avatar is one if those movies that will . I saw 22 min of it a comic-con and I had to change my boxers . I 'm seeing it in 8 hours and I ca n't wait ... the shitty thing is that I work at a theater and avatar is sitting 5 feet from me and I ca n't watch it yet ...

To give a comparison , Hulk at his * absolute * strongest so far was at most capable of breaking a planet . Destroying planets is something Thanos does with little effort . He laughs off Thor 's and Silver Surfer 's biggest hits . He 's obviously gon na be nerfed in the MCU , but remember in the Avengers , Hulk was temporarily overwhelmed by the * Chitauri * . Thanos is gon na be ridiculously stronger than that . No , the audience does n't care about tiers , but I do n't see how that matters , it 's just a matter of who 's stronger than the other . The audience can still enjoy Hulk taking a beating

1 He 's much loved , so not really relevant .

1 They got those before Disney got Star Wars . Disney and WB have come to a deal for future use though .

1 thats why it is called a paradox , there is no begining , no end , it is a perfect loop .

1 Why are you making a nationality assumption about people who have trouble with the conclusion ? What makes him / her seem American . Perhaps you have a superiority problem and that 's the real issue . There is no need for your snobbery , someone wanted to talk about their interpretation . Pretentious douchebag statements like you made at the end of your comment only make me feel like you are , in fact , an annoying shit .

1 Butch Cassidy always filled me with this unsettling existential dread . The fact that they were always being followed . Not close enough to cause a reaction , but not far enough to be safe . Just enough to be uncomfortable . A sense of pure dread . The sting had nothing to compare with .

1 Unfortunately , I feel like hers will be one of the most criminally unrecognized performances of the year . She was incredible in the movie .

1 Yeah , there 'll be this thing kinda like VHS , but better . And there 'll be an even better one . And that 's what we 'll use it for !

1 Top flick

1 I thought he did really well . However , I do n't watch HIMYM so maybe that makes it easier .

1 Mmmm Bacon Mlair

1 Actually Perlman loves playing Hellboy

1 never heard of it , will check it out ! thanks !

1 Bodies are like clothes to Maiar .

1 The original actor was probably contracted to American Horror Story , where he is one of the focal characters

1 THANKS ! Merry Christmas ; )

1 It could be the same `` so positive and out of touch it 's creepy '' vibe Depp had in Charlie and the chocolate factory .

1 There is no question who would win this . See the problem is , you 've confused the strengths of two different characters . While Tyler Durden had resolve , he was fighting against regular , joe-shmoe fellas that wanted to escape their boring , father-less lives . He was a beacon of rebellion and anarchy . He was the `` attitude '' that everyone wanted to display in real life , but were too afraid to do it on their own . He did n't have elite fighting skills and was n't trained in any type of fighting defense . Dalton , was a bad-ass , throat-ripping , ass-kicking , S.O.B ... ..just ask Marshall Teague ... .oh yeah , and he had an oily chest , so there 's that too .

1 > Not even the best for Kubrick IMO You say this like it 's easy . Anyway , I love it . I rewatch it every other year .

1 I love that I understand this comment . Upvote for you good sir .

1 Better sci fi than Jupiter Ascending .

1 They god damn better bring it back .

1 You do n't like normal , face-to-face human interaction ... do you ? With all the repetition and the hedging and humming . The way friends and family reconnect on old stories that everyone 's heard a thousand times . The constant marking of seasons , holidays , weathers , comings and goings ? Chill out a bit , yeah ? It 's just people being people .

1 It 's bizarre to see someone who hoped to make a justice league movie who seems to genuinely hate everything fundamental to the characters & makes fun of the fans .

1 Nope . That 's why The Joker chose Rachel , he knew Batman was in love with her based off their interaction in the penthouse . He made Batman choose between what 's better for him personally and for the city . And then denied him his choice .

1 They did that very well in X2 as well . I specifically remember thinking while watching it ; `` The X-men cant get out of this jam ! It 's too big , it 's chaos ! '' That sense of uncertainty is very hard to create - especially in superhero movies

1 and power rangers !

1 First Class was great . It was a very groooovy mutation .

1 It 's fucking shredder , I am making a personal stand on this .

1 In the butt .

1 I 'M JOHN KIMBALL . I 'M A COPPPPPPP ! !

1 I look like a shirt now , only 29 .

1 You 're a grammatical error

1 I was n't crazy about it either because of the weird tonal shift after the church . First half of the movie was lighthearted and slapstick then took a u-turn into Kill Bill . I guess that 's what they were going for but to me it felt like shock for the sake of shock . I 'm no West Borough fan or a fan of any religion , but when he told the lady he was off to meet his black , gay boyfriend , I thought it was hilarious ... then two seconds later he blows her head off ? I get that he was brainwashed , it just seems like they suddenly switched writers mid-scene .

1 I do n't think McAvoy could pull off bond at all . He does n't seem to have to stature .

1 If your infographic is all text and actually makes the content harder to follow , you probably should n't have made an infographic .

1 Thelma & Louise . Watch it .

1 And not only is it really weird , but it is also really , really good !

1 I 'm amazed by the lack of actual argument in your post

1 This partly explains why some people find old films to be boring .

1 Can you call any reboot by the same name ? Yes . Here 's to it keeping with the spirit of the original ! ! !

1 Yeah I know , I have seen the movie a couple of times .

1 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrggggghhhhhhh !

1 That too .

1 Well , yeah . Product placement .

1 The host actor is great . This was actually funny . Rare that I like a youtube vid , even rarer if it 's about dicks .

1 Spanish accent = Javier , American accent = JDM

1 It 's more socially accepted to applaud at the end of the movie .

1 It works even if it 's monotonous . Turns out people who buy things based on the cover art or poster like monotony .

1 This is my vote . Have n't seen any recent film better .

1 I regret not seeing it at the cinema . the marketing in the UK was non existent . and I think it git barely any screenings . I hope Deadpool is a big success , i just doubt it . Maybe it 'll pull a John Wick though .

1 Yeah you 're likely right . Hand to mouth was a poor choice of words

1 Lieutenant Daniel Taylor : Have you found Jesus yet , Gump ? Forrest Gump : I did n't know I was supposed to be looking for him , sir .

1 They did . It 's called Rise of the planet of the apes and Dawn of the planet of the apes

1 They probably were n't expecting to say , `` 10 Academy Award Nominations and ... Do n't worry about how many wins ... ''

1 One scene does not redeem an entire film full of man love . At least Scrubs understands and laughs at the bro-love , does n't make it any less homoerotic though . Not that it 's a bad thing , it just is what it is . Sure you could probably take the film seriously when it was released , not any more though , like many things .

1 [ Frankenstein ( 1994 ) ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Frankenstein_\ ( 1994_film\ ) )

1 My first thought was `` That Harmony Korine movie about the Michael Jackson impersonator ? '' But this looks like a really interesting film I 'll have to check it out . Thanks OP !

1 G

1 Could n't sleep for days .

1 Yeah , I do n't see how it 's the same at all . Two completely different approaches and in the movie , she delivers the line * before * the lightning which completely negates his intent for it .

1 Big Hero 6 is actually a Disney movie , not Pixar . But I 'm amazed by all the Easter eggs both of them put in their movies .

1 I loved that movie . Very well done indeed

1 That 's on Netflix ? Awesome !

1 This . I 'm a pretty bright guy ; the type who 's usually answering other people when they ask `` wait what just happened ? '' even if I 've never seen the movie before . I watched TTSS with two other people , both of whom are very intelligent , attention-paying type of people . We spent the whole movie going WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING ? ! ? ! I appreciate the craft of the film , but it clearly was n't intended for mass consumption .

1 That boy is good !

1 I always discern them by the fact that Amy has the 'girl-next-door ' look , and Isla as the more sexy look and personality . I can totally see them playing sisters .

1 You have the movie tastes of a cool grandma .

1 bass to mouth

1 Nailed it .

1 Misleading title . It just says Quentin was asked , he 's not currently involved with the project .

1 The fight scenes were great . The rest was boring . And it does n't help that the best character died 20 minutes in .

1 Jaws . If I catch 30 seconds of it in passing , the world stops . I ca n't look away or change the channel until it 's over .

1 I always consider it a challenge to get a large soda and not pee before the end of the movie I 've been able to do this in every movie since age 15 , just go to the bathroom beforehand and it 'll be fine .

1 surprise surprise , he gave him a pot cookie

1 I dont ' think anyone is parotting tarantino . I remember walking out of the theater after seeing this movie and hating the twist in the third act . To me tarrantino 's comments on the movie just validate mine and several others . And most people have never seen that video review of his .

1 `` The floor '' in SDCC parlance means `` The show floor '' - as opposed to conference rooms or meeting halls . The stage where the contest took place was on `` the floor . '' Sorry if I confused you .

1 This post is full of kids bitching about how they wasted their own time , at an event they were lucky enough to win . Please also point out they 're all a bunch of adults , who whine like kids .

1 The Aether from Thor 2 was also one I think , and The collector has it on Knowhere .

1 Well by all appearances she 's totally nuts .

1 [ Indeed ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=BBwepkVurCI ) .

1 I ca n't speak for OP , but it just looks like fun dinosaur action to me . I 'm not expecting it to be The Godfather or an Academy Award winner , but I bet I have a great time watching it .

1 Check out cocoa dulce in Bradley Fair as well damn good coffee and amazing chocolate

1 That 's an interesting angle that is n't really fully explored . Might have been a better movie if the kid was just nuts and used the doll as an excuse for the things he did .

1 And Coruscant would still be under the rigid control of the empire . They would n't be cheering in the streets because the rebels won a second battle .

1 It 's not a remake ? Also , there were books first , which the movie did n't follow too closely , I might add . Maybe this 'll add in some more stuff from the source material .

1 You came to the wrong subreddit

1 That is ungodly fake

1 Including conning all those people out of their money and ratting on his friends who offered to help with his legal fees and restitution .

1 `` A movie is not what it is about , but how it is about it. ? - Roger Ebert

1 i can see Liam Neeson saying that .

1 I 'm not much of a fan .

1 I 'll take it .

1 > Brothers Nope .

1 Agreed . The entire feel of the movie worked so well . Very unique and it was executed perfectly .

1 You say this as I am watching this movie on my Chromecast via YouTube rental . Fuck off with your angry judgmental assumptions , lol . I was speaking more generally .

1 It 's got a 48 % on RottenTomatoes , a 6.6 rating on IMDB , and of the people I know who 've seen it , only 1 liked it . So from my perspective it 's very underrated .

1 I agree with the bullets . Still , the rest of the list is [ ... ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / zuxO6.png ) Guess it 's time to learn cyrillic .

1 Me too , but people should really see The Broken Circle Breakdown if they get the chance . The soundtrack is god damn gorgeous .

1 Yep

1 Whether Woody Allen molested Dylan Farrow is unknown . Mia and Dylan Farrow say he did . Allen and Moses Farrow say he did n't . The police did n't find any evidence saying he did , the judge did n't really have anything to go on . If he is a child molester he deserves to be tossed into prison , but I 'm not willing to convict a man without evidence .

1 Right in the ball sack

1 JK Simmons in Whiplash . Definitely a dude with a ton of screen presence , but he slaughtered that movie .

1 Nah , I just have n't been on here in a while , so I may have missed something .

1 > The CORRECT answer to OP 's question is Steven Spielberg , Duel . That guy fell off harder and farther than anybody ever has . One great movie , then decades of the worst trash imaginable Is that the answer to the question `` What is the most delusional opinion out there ? ''

1 He said : `` I can smell your downvote ''

1 My biggest gripe was the 20-solid minutes of hue-shifting landscape at the end . That was just pretentious .

1 The Blues Brothers

1 There is /r/bloopers

1 I really do n't get it when people say the MCU movies feel the same . They have macguffins and meh villains often , but who saw Guardians of the Galaxy and was reminded of Captain America : The Winter Soldier ? Who thought Thor was too much like Iron Man 3 ?

1 > wahhh this comment was just a simple joke but ill get butthurt about it anyway wahhh -hanni90 ftfy

1 Airplane !

1 It has n't been about `` race '' for a while though .

1 Skeksis !

1 They looked scary , but had shitty aim and acted a lot like humans trying to fight and pummel someone rather than trying to kill . A machine , with the sole objective to kill a target , would have just squeezed the moment he grabbed said target , not thrown him around and stuff trying to look cool . It 's just hard to consider something scary that 's so stupid and humanlike .

1 `` I 'm going to reveal my identity ! '' `` Ca n't let you do that , Starfox ! ''

1 wow ... . whoosh .

1 Garth looked the same IMO

1 I actually thought he loved his job , he seemed so proud and enthusiastic about it in the beginning , he was a strict idealist . It 's him starting to like and humanize these particular people he spied on that caused him to abandon his views .

1 Ca n't wait to not see this piece of shit .

1 RYBACK ! ! ! ! ! !

1 > It will win best picture . FTFY

1 Oh man , I forgot about Kids . That 's a big insight into 90s youth culture .

1 I thought 'Begins ' was easily the best of the Trilogy , what I really loved about the Dark Knight had nothing to so with the the Joker , and everything to so with how well ( not to mention how badass ) they did Two Face . I find that to be an opinion I usually do n't find much support with , but when i first saw Dent in # 2 , in the back of my mind I was thinking 'Set up for Batman 3 , sick ! ' I loved how they put it all together , which was why in DKR I was so disappointed with Bane , his back story was completely changed and I felt it was more of a 'yeaaaa ? just put him with Al Ghoul ' , the kid from 3rd Rock From the Sun ( I do n't care what his name is , he 'll always be that kid to me ) becoming Robin is another HUGE piss off I have , I was really happy it was the end of the movie , because at that point I wanted to walk out of the movie .

1 What a lovely family .

1 Well , certainly it would n't be an instant catastrophe , but do note that all crop could have been destroyed , and even Scandinavians ca n't survive an eternal winter without food .

1 you 're right , I forgot about that . that kid was annoying as fuck but he played the part really well .

1 They literally say `` the kaiju are adapting '' at least 3 times in the film . And * SPOILER * Charlie day explains that when he drifted with the kaiju brain they explained the hive mind shit and since he knows how the jaegers work , the kaiju now know how to destroy them more effectively .

1 You just had to ruin it , did n't you ?

1 And there 's plenty potential for lady-feet ...

1 Assuming that 's true , what the fuck is the matter with your parents ?

1 I hope the next time you pull that shit it 's a kickboxer sitting behind you .

1 Redundanct article ? a cinematographer is surely going to be a photographer as well ?

1 I 've got no problem with Doug Jones , I 've got a problem with saying he is n't typecast .

1 Every year from January to early spring is going to suck . Usually the best stuff does not begin to get released until fall . The great Indie films do not start to get leeking out until later spring , serious well-made mainstream Hollywood releases are still not here yet . At least there has been The LEGO Movie and a wide release of The Wind Rises . So I think 2014 is doing above average right now .

1 STOP SAYING THAT

1 Every bit of CG is a lot of work . For it to look good on screen it needs to be perfect , anything less and it looks like something from a late nineties video game cutscene .

1 Wow , Richard dean Anderson and Michael Shanks look way different in that movie . ( Yes , thank you , I know )

1 He knew Bueller was full of it , but nobody would believe him . [ Cassandra 's Curse ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Cassandra_ ( metaphor ) .

1 great horror movie , and one of my absolute favorite movies ever .

1 Eh.. Part of the creepy factor is that there is minimal blatant context . Mulholland Dr. is a notoriously 'bizarre ' film . It 's best you watch it without any background info . It 's a bit creepy at times but overall enjoyable if you like stuff like fight club , memento , that sort of thing .

1 Put your bullshit waders on because we 're going deep ! So the explanation that I 've seen , and it is possible that someone will come through and correct me , is that yes , in fact , parsecs are distance . The kessel run goes past / through The Maw which is a giant area of space that is riddled with black holes . It is a good way to dissuade would-be pursuers from following you , but also incredibly dangerous . The trick is that the closer you can / are willing to skirt the black holes , the shorter the distance for the run / the faster your time . Han skirted The Millenium Falcon closer to the black holes than any reasonably sane person would dare to , and as such managed the shortest run on record . This does n't really explain why Han tried to use it to explain how fast the Millenium Falcon is , but I guess `` I can rub my nuts on a black hole and walk away safe in this ship '' is as good a brag as any when ~~luring in suckers~~ advertising your services to customers .

1 Her pretty little head if I recall . I got to make time to watch this again .

1 The Human Centipede and Hostel have nothing on these . Gummo made me pretty much numb to `` fucked up '' movies years ago .

1 Got to your closest bank or foreign exchange .

1 Also put the blond haired , blue eyed chaps into the boats first . The reason we put the sick , elderly , and handicapped first is because we want to promote a society with empathy over one that is full of ubermensch .

1 No . Netflix is america only . IMDb is worldwide .

1 No , that 's completely illogical . Alfred sent Gordon the names of every officer with family members in the hospital ( the second text , word for word was `` Cops with relatives in Gotham hospitals. '' ) . If I sent you a text with my favorite Presidents and it said `` Lincoln , Kennedy '' would you assume my favorite president was named Kennedy Lincoln ? That 's stupid as hell . Yes , Gordon `` literally '' says `` Berg , is n't it ? '' . A police commissioner LITERALLY calls an officer by his last name . Jesus , what a giant fucking plot hole , police officers answering when their superior officer calls them their last name . The `` Ramirez '' in the text refers to Detective Ramirez , laying the groundwork for that storyline later . The `` Berg '' sets up the immediate action . My only complaint for that section is it should have been padded out with a couple more names - but since the audience only gets a quick glimpse , Nolan had to keep it simple .

1 If this were a new story or even just a story featuring only one character , there would be A LOT more possibilities . But for this specific film , which is a sequel , crossover and startup film all rolled into one , there are only so many writers to logically choose from . Aronofsky was on his way to direct the Batman reboot before Nolan got it . That definitely would have been interesting to see : http : / io9.com / concept-art-shows-off-darren-aronofskys-batman-movie-t-493180650

1 Rated PG-13 .

1 Certainly Ron Howard and Zemeckis .

1 i heard box office take was related to quality and not marketing strategy

1 Personally I thought it was pretty funny , but yeah usually you 'd just leave it as is or translate as thanks for the food .

1 Actually I think he was channelling Frank Gorshin , who I LOVE as The Riddler , but I think it would be totally out of place in a modern Batman movie .

1 I dont see the problem with that . Maybe they just agree .

1 I do creature / character design . I worked on JA early in the design phase , and it was a but load of fun ! I also teach Creaturing modeling at Gnomon School of VFX in LA . Most important thing is having a strong art foundation , a great demo reel / portfolio and knowing a buttload of programs .

1 That movie really did have some great fight scenes .

1 It would be cool , but it 's really , really unlikely . QT was a production assistant on one of Dolph Lundgren 's movies in the 80s , and Dolph apparently treated him like shit . Tarantino once told Howard Stern that , as a result of that experience , Lundgren has no chance of ever having a role in any of his movies .

1 Glad someone else has seen it and was impressed . I thought for a horror movie that is n't very well known , it did a great job . Loved how it was able to mind fuck you into the natural reaction to the villagers . But as the movie progresses you 're like , `` Ah , so THAT 'S why they were acting like that . '' Not the greatest horror film or anything but definitely a solid one and worth a viewing .

1 to the top with you , these are both great !

1 satyajit ray 's movies ( even though they are amazing ) are not counted as bollywood and mughal e azam is a horrible recommendation for someone trying to get into bollywood . Sholay is actually a copy of kurosawa 's seven samurai . It has horrible dialogue , bad pacing , bad character development and some of the most ridiculous and artificial scenes . It also has one of the worst final fight ( the one with the guy with no legs fights ) in the history of cinema .

1 `` You like your father are now mine '' - Black Palpitine .

1 I was envisioning metal gear Rex rampaging through `` middle America '' , hunting Shia 's character because he possesses the nuclear launch codes in his glasses for some stupid reason .

1 Yeah at least I did n't force anyone to come with me , my friend and I just spent two hours ranting about it afterwards .

1 He still cant milk it too hard.. the Grey was a great movie , he needs more akin to that .

1 I think this post is about discovering interesting pieces of music that we otherwise would not have listened to because the films are terrible . I never would see myself watching Twilight , but the song by Alexandre Desplat in this post is absolutely beautiful . The problem with movies is that if the movie is bad in terms of story / plot then people often overlook the other aspects of production and the creators go unnoticed . It 's like finding gold in a pile of shit , you do n't really want to look through it but someone else has so go reap the benefits .

1 I hope Bay wins Worst Director . He really does n't seem to give a shit about these movies outside of creating expensive tech demos .

1 Is High Fidelity a 'music ' film ? If so , then that .

1 Se7en it is . That was the first time I watched a movie and once I was done watched it again . I had to . Partly to be able to process what I had just seen . It was so out of left field I was along for the ride the whole way .

1 Coitus ?

1 Too respectful

1 I did n't listen to the commentary but when I saw the movie in theaters I got it the first run through , all you have to do is pay attention to their conversation , which you should be doing anyway .

1 I was wondering the same thing . Few theories I came up with ( mostly using what I 've learned from movies ) : 1 . They 're paid off . 2 . A legal loophole ( you ca n't bust into a famous persons house on the `` well TMZ says you do drugs ... '' Or `` a friend of a friend who knows a director said you usually do drugs ... '' 3 . The cops in Hollywood are all also sex crazed and doing tons of blow for young butthole . 4 . They do n't care . They 're busy doing important things ( beating people up , putting dangerous pot heads behind bars , watching X-Men movies ) .

1 If people stuck to these rules , I might go back to the theaters to see movies

1 That story ( I saw the original short film version ) was so fucked up I had to show my friend the last scene so she could be horrified with me .

1 He was a little rude . It was a little uncalled for and impolite . And you do have fine taste . However , in his defense , he spends a lot of time on r / movies and some of those films you mention * do * get name-checked here * over and over * . Particularly 12 Angry Men , the Spaghetti Westerns and the Samurai stuff . So those get oodles of love here and do n't quite meet the OP 's criteria . And then you had the one Kubrick and the Wilder - those are out . Lawrence of Arabia gets a lot of attention and is universally regarded as a classic , but IMHO it 's so , so good that it 's still sort of underrated . That film is 50 years old , but still , with all of the technology available today , nobody has really topped it in terms of pure spectacle . Still , maybe not quite what the OP was looking for . But props to you for mentioning a non-Samurai Kurosawa ( personally I think those are the best Kurosawa , though it 's close ) , for your obvious admiration of the great Paul Newman , for High Noon , and for the nice bit at the end about `` kids these days '' ( fuck the vicious little shits : they should learn some goddamn respect ) . People who are on this subreddit a lot get a little jaded , so you 'll have to forgive the occasional crankiness from some guy who 's just seen The Good , the Bad and the Ugly referenced for the 800th time in the last two days . I 'll now have to rewatch Major Dundee and The Fall of the Roman Empire . I have n't seen those in years !

1 Except Thanos is in GOTG ... so I mean that 's only 2 years

1 `` You IDIOTS ! You 've captured their * stunt doubles * ! ''

1 Ha ha there was a time when I was into ICP . Back in 96 / 97 before the internet and napster when you still went into town to buy your cds and being entranced by the packaging and bringing it home and putting it on and going what the hell is this ? As a kid I thought it both edgy and hilarious . There was n't any baggage that came with it at the time . Did n't know of the eminem feud , stuff about them being christian , or juggalo fandom or any gatherings and such . As a kid , taking it as face value , I just thought it was pretty entertaining and completely different from anything I 'd heard of at the time . I do n't listen to them anymore but I still like [ this track ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=kfbbGDv20SE ) . They completely miss the point of The Tell Tale Heart but the music behind the rap is still pretty great .

1 I enjoyed ASM more than Spidermans 1 and 3 . 2 is a stretch . We 'll see with this one though .

1 easily one of my favorite films

1 Shepherds are special creatures .

1 White and / or male-led films still outnumber black and / or female-led films overwhelmingly . No , we do n't `` got enough of those in Hollywood . '' There are n't nearly enough . We do need other less-represented groups too , but that does n't mean discouraging or excluding female or black filmmakers when there are already so few .

1 The selection of music in the movie is wonderful . Even the [ original ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=tymWDB7gtK4 ) trailer 's [ song were amazing ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=k1uUIJPD0Nk ) . Edit : corrected the second link .

1 Agreed . Halfway into the movie we could basically say `` yes , we get it , and we got it a long time ago - it 's not that profound . '' [ Brokeback ] ( http : / i40.tinypic.com / 124jzac.jpg ) should have won that year .

1 No ruttin ' way .

1 You can barely see his top gum ...

1 Fear lead to Anger .

1 But Batman would n't have been killed off ; Bruce Wayne would have been . Batman lives on .

1 Because Marvel Studios still owns the characters . They just license them out for a period of time depending on the contract . That 's why there 's still a Marvel Studios logo before each film , meaning that while they may not fall into the MCU , they 're still Marvel .

1 He could really use the job .

1 McCaffery 's Pern .

1 A lot of Miyazaki-san 's movies * are * great children 's stories . He never claims otherwise . The fact that even his most kid-friendly stories ( Kiki 's Delivery service comes to mind ) are still engaging to adults shows how good they are . To be fair , I probably would n't have been as interested in them when I was 27 . You may come back to them , especially if you have kids .

1 Yeah , it 's really fuzzy for me too . : ( Like , I know they had Zoe Saldana , and the actor who played The Comedian in Watchmen , who ... I think they 're together , or were together , and they 've got this team , and they 're all going out for ... * revenge * , on something ? Somebody ? They were all pretty mad about something . And then there was this big action setpiece near the end in a shipment yard , right ? Lots of warm tones in the coloring of the movie , too , I feel like .

1 Souvenir shop destruction scene in Zombieland - I wan na do that .

1 Is there anyone that thinks Megan Fox is even serviceable as an actress ? Pretty sure she 's universally regarded as just eye candy .

1 Shhh , do n't worry Jennie . It 's me , Casper .

1 First how old are you ? 2nd how many movies have you seen that were made after PF came out ? PF seen after more recent movies does not have the same impact as seeing it before the movies it inspired . Non-linear story line , dialog that does not advance the plot , pop culture references etc , were novel at the time and now seem old hat when compared to modern movie . There was a whole article on this on [ TVtropes ] ( http : / tvtropes.org / pmwiki / pmwiki.php / Main / SeinfeldIsUnfunny )

1 Nice try Cypher .

1 N , but the death in this film is used to give the character depth , not just to satisfy a third act .

1 best guess is that this is during preproduction and they are using a model to try and plan what type of shots they want to get when they spend enormous amounts of money on extras and location . They likely only had a day or two to get all of the wide shots in the desert with that many extras and they needed to know exactly what the set-ups would be .

1 The piece they 're playing , `` Whiplash '' , is in 7 / 4 time , so Fletcher counting off `` 5 6 AND '' makes total sense ( He does n't say 8 ) .

1 [ Zing ! ] ( http : / www.troll.me / images / thumbs-up-jesus-says / zing.jpg )

1 I disagree . * The Magnificent Seven * , * The Departed * , * Ocean 's 11 * , and I disagree . John Carpenter 's * The Thing * are all great movies , and they 're all remakes .

1 The manga expands upon a lot of the story . This site : http : / www.akira2019.com / faq.htm mainly talks about the events of the manga .

1 It 's so touching that `` his only crime was that he loved [ Talia ] . ''

1 How do you go from `` Maltese Falcon '' to `` The Black Bird '' ? * looks at 1975 * Coke parties .

1 and that 's yours . why 's that ?

1 > It was a 90 minute art piece * without a plot or storyline * . A complete failure as a movie or entertainment . ... > The * storyline * was cliche and boring and the pacing was completely wrong . Well , everything appears to be in order here . Carry on . Edit : you realize that ~~are~~ art is subjective and that this is just your opinion , right ? Stop acting like your shit do n't stink .

1 That 's a decent butthole . I really think a bikini wax would make it far more aesthetically pleasing . 6 / 10

1 Because it 's true for the most part ?

1 * worlrd

1 My 3D TV is passive - same glasses as the theater - they weigh nothing , and are actually more comfortable than a dopey Xbox headset .

1 I would like to inform you that Attack of the Clones is 67 % on Rotten Tomatoes .

1 I hardly recognize him . Ever .

1 Orson was simply cultivating mass

1 It was just called `` Santa Claus . '' [ Here 's the reindeer part . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? feature=player_detailpage & v=iXKOF6rntUg # t=2737 ) Also , [ do n't forget to watch the opening full of cultural stereotype children ! ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? feature=player_detailpage & v=iXKOF6rntUg # t=540 )

1 Bitch , you almost made me laugh .

1 Don Bluth , actually .

1 Who 's that ? Lois 's brother ? : P

1 10 Things I Hate About You ?

1 Let 's be honest , there 'll be a 7th . There 's too much money to be made for there not to be .

1 He did God Bless America and Worlds Greatest Dad , both are pretty damn good

1 its Rampart . Let 's focus on the film people .

1 Holy shit I got ta remember this one ...

1 Thanks for your contribution !

1 You know what , you suck ! !

1 Carlito 's Way and Unforgiven . I really did n't like either one , thought Pacino was over doing it and Eastwood was under playing it . I had to grow up , look at their back catalogues and understand the subtlety of what they were doing . Similarly themed films , both classics .

1 I had forgotten about that movie . Now I have to go and vomit all over again .

1 Such a great movie , WKW is the man .

1 Man , this gets me every time . Sometimes , I find myself thinking of True Romance , then of Drexl Spivey , and then I want to watch it all over again - just for Drexl Spivey . In cases such as those , a youtube clip usually opens up the next two hours of my life .

1 that was a SURPRISINGLY well done movie

1 `` Funny '' in an unsettling and uncomfortable way . You are n't laughing because what John du Pont says is funny you laugh because of how weird he is and how uncomfortable he is to watch . You lose that context if you only see one scene . Its a very serious movie it did n't `` go over my head '' at all .

1 It 's the journey not the destination . Titanic was pretty predictable for some reason and people loved it . Hell , many people knew not only what American Sniper was about but what would likely be in it . I just named two films that are both immensely popular with solid chances at picture of the year despite being predictable .

1 Mindy Kaling was amazing in The Great Dictator .

1 * boohlshit . Naht even one football

1 Many believe so . One button to flush , one for water spray , one to dry .

1 I do n't think you need to watch any the TV episodes to be able to understand the films as I think the plots are fairly self-contained .

1 As an archer , I agree .

1 me too .

1 That documentary was n't actually in Rodman 's group . The vice one was with the Harlem Globetrotters who played at the basketball exhibition game . Rodman had his own group of cameras following him which was not in that doc .

1 No this list is terrible and should be buried

1 Oh , God . This . I had to plug my ears through half of the last half of Interstellar .

1 I 'm comparing a market set by demand to a market set by demand . How is that apples and oranges ? Does the `` Meat Industry '' not care about what people buy ? Why do you think more hamburgers are sold than pickled pigs feet ? It 's demand , plain and simple . I 'm not on a crusade , just saying that by choosing to buy or not buy something you are influencing the market . That 's a fact .

1 I mean objectively from a fans perspective sure , they 're not . But they would n't keep getting hired for big tentpole franchises if they blew . Shitty writers flush out quick . They do the jobs they are hired to do and do them well . Also have you ever thought of magic blood ? Twice ? ?

1 it holds high opinions because it makes a great social commentary and also has excellent action sequences . its a movie that delivers to all kinds of audiences . clearly youre one of those people who will think too much into a movie instead of just enjoying the ride

1 Yeah , I think that 's actually what their aiming for now . When they did Casino Royal and Quantum of Solace they were intentionally distancing themselves from some of the classic campy elements of previous bond films . But now that they 've established themselves they 're more comfortable playing with classic bond elements . Skyfall was an example of that with the use of Raoul Silva as a sort of classic Bond villian with a more dark and serious tone fitting with the Daniel Craig Bond films .

1 No . IE is Lindsay Lohan . When she was new to the scene , she seemed hot and sexy , but before long , everyone knew she had few if any redeeming values , and in reality is a dirty skank who undoubtedly has quite a few diseases . Yet , for some inexplicable reason , she 's still kinda ' popular . Netscape is Eddie Murphy . He was fantastic , wonderful ... until he sold out . Now he 's completely obsolete .

1 That 's the same plan they had the last time . Van Helsing . To this day , the words send chills down my spine and evoke the faint scent of cheese . Surely the fools at Universal would be mad to tempt fate yet again . If this news is true , something must be done . We must prevent them from unleashing this hell upon the earth again .

1 `` Commando '' , `` Demolition Man '' , `` Desperado ''

1 * Mercury Rising *

1 And that is exactly why these overrated directors / producers keep making the big bucks .

1 We 're Jews.. we 're jews in space Zooming around , defending the Hebrew Race !

1 Underrated by whom ?

1 Movie was ok , score was amazing .

1 I mean , I know it 's kinda sad but this movie is mostly pleasant and `` warm '' if that makes any sense . It 's quiet and humble and has great performances .

1 That is a scriptwriting heuristic which has been around since the advent of the script . No , it is n't exact , but neither does the language in the material you quoted portray it as `` math '' . It certainly * does * mean something . It 's a rule of thumb , and it 's accurate enough to be useful for making a lot of determinations about a script .

1 haha . Strange that technically all those guys should have above average head sizes . I really want to hang out with some proper actors now to see what the average is . Hell I need to write a paper on this ! Now only to find a way to measure actor 's heads ...

1 Yeah , it 's got to be Katherine Hepburn . Her performance in Philadelphia Story had me in stitches .

1 + * Ponyo *

1 Try Bollywood you might like it

1 They did an * [ Alfred Hitchcock movie about making Psycho ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0975645 / ) * .

1 No Marvel movie has had their hero facing an enemy that dangerous so early in their `` career '' .

1 plenty of people mentioned TDKR ye lazy bitch , read

1 I loved the scene where they were showing off their cards . You would n't think a scene of a couple people showing off cards would be so intense .

1 Maybe , although he did n't snitch on Joe .

1 What exactly are today 's standards regarding Godzilla ? If you 're going to change the monster you might as well change the movie name also .

1 Apparently they actually shot that ending , but did n't finish the CG . It 'll probably look like shit , but if they are generous it 'll be on the Blu-Ray . I 'd be curious to see how it looks .

1 Fuck it ; throw 'em ALL in there . We can call it Avengers 2 !

1 In his [ Dark Knight review ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Qcqr2CQHeJs ) he says he even has a weirder set of eyebrows underneath them

1 That was a film I did n't expect to bawl my eyes out in .

1 I loved that movie as a kid and still to this day do despite the way I perceive the story different now . I was naive and loved army shit , did n't really see what was so bad ha .

1 Whiplash

1 That 's not a remake .

1 Maybe just a Goku has a Spirit Bomb , maybe Frieza learned a new form of attack in hell , The Hell Bomb . He can summon all of the dead energy in hell of all of Goku 's defeated enemies . He combines all of that energy into an attack that could destroy the whole solar system . BTW I 'm getting bummed out by all the talk about stuff being non canon . I always wanted Broly to be canon . And the Tree of Might had some solid action in it .

1 The best part about the first two films were Bilbo . Martin Freeman 's scenes are the most interesting because he is the most RELATABLE character in this mess of of a video game . And with that said , the singular best thing of these films is the scene in the cave , with Golumn . JRR T. went back an re-wrote that scene specifically . That scene feels like it could have been out of a play . Real dialogue . Real tension between the characters . Real shit ! ! None of these bobsleds / barrel river rides / baby goblins on a zip line ! Go back and watch that scene and notice how different you feel when you are watching the rest of the `` film '' .

1 this guy gets it .

1 [ ugh. ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / w8fIA.gif )

1 Yep , it was pretty much told during the intro sequence and then fleshed out during the movie ( mostly by General Ross )

1 it baffles you , really ? think about it for a few more seconds . the amount of things wolverine stabs and slashes through . people , stone , wood , steel . real blades would not be able to do any of those things .

1 The best parodies tend to be the ones where there 's genuine affection for the subject matter .

1 Big smile on my face every time his badassery was on screen in Fast 6

1 Complete and utter bullshit . Try reading the books which came years before the movies .

1 ? _ ?

1 How do you know you do n't like tarentinos style if you 've never watched his movies ?

1 It does n't seem to account for other languages ... http : / answers.yahoo.com / question / index ? qid=20080725111942AAg4aZJ

1 safety , for one . Most directors are a bit leery of replacing stunt doubles every 2 takes because they broke them .

1 yeah Kasparu , real creative ideas . Just take all the characters from Christopher Nolan batmans and put them in Superman . You 're a genius .

1 In Signs because the guy is a priest the 'aliens ' may represent ghosts / demons and that 's why they react to ( holy ) water

1 Meh , it 's just karma . And I 've got plenty of it already . Not sure how what I said offended anyone , though . ? \\\_ ( ? ) _ / ?

1 Spielberg named the shark Bruce after his lawyer .

1 I feel like you probably were not watching Looper on netflix yesterday , seeing as it just came out in theaters last week . You really need to cut back on the sauce , man . However if you like Looper , I might suggest 12 Monkeys ( also starring Bruce Willis ) , The Terminator , and Blade Runner .

1 I saw a screening of it last week . It was pretty well done but predictable at times , although , the suspense was well drawn out . Also , there are some plot holes but they 're not terrible . Over all I would say a 7 out of ten . Great acting throughout highlights the movie .

1 I better get royalties for it

1 Getting to know someone means that you are on the scale between not knowing them and knowing them . The likelihood of reaching the knowing someone end of the scale purely over reddit is very low . You do n't care about karma , but you do care about attention . You 'll role around in your own feces until the attendants come and hose you down , just because they 'd have to look at you well enough to aim the hoses .

1 I had a hard time reading that book just based on the slang that 's used .

1 Thanks ! I freakin ' love that game ! !

1 You should read the book ! Honestly , it 's very real . I kinda love Nick Hornby .

1 Based on a well known subreddit with dinosaurs and * cars *

1 It is , but the delivery is just ... off . The camera is slightly distanced , Batman says it dryly without moving ( the two are just standing there talking to each other ) and then the camera zooms in immediately after for the fight scene . It reminded me a lot of a video game cut scene .

1 I fucking loved that show .

1 Because they have to pay the owners to have the content . They ca n't afford to indefinitely offer every movie ever .

1 Turns out the memory wipe has a few side effects when used over and over..

1 North England , fuck yeah !

1 The Godfather

1 I was crushed to find out that the October dates were only film festival dates . I honestly thought this movie was coming out in December but now I find that it 's a limited release until Jan 9th . Aarrrggg it keeps tricking me .

1 This is a movie I never watched until recently even though a lot of my friends grew up with the movie . I loved it and had such a good time watching it . It 's one of those movies where I had a smile on my face throughout the entire movie .

1 Wow . Add this one to the `` things I 'll deny knowing about if anyone irl asks me ''

1 It make more sense in Firefly though because everyone is speaking in the same Wild West-style speech patterns .

1 Oh man that movie wrecked me completely .

1 Yes ! The part where [ spoiler ] ( # s `` he describes how he won , with the axe flying back up over the edge of the cliff `` ) gives me chills .

1 i think that 's what he 's talking about .

1 After I saw all the critical praise of this movie I was just thinking the other day how much I wished I could read Ebert 's thoughts on it . From the trailer , it seemed like the kind of movie he would think highly of . Lo and behold he saw and reviewed it indeed , and with a high rating at that ! This made me very happy and more excited to see the movie . Thanks for posting .

1 I drive a train . I thought I was the engineer . Sigh .

1 One reason I know the acting was good , is because I spent the entire movie wanting to roundhouse kick that religious fanatic woman .

1 you should probably spoiler-tag that , since that movie just came out and many people have n't gotten to see it yet .

1 That trailer was perfect . Great story hook . I expected more than what the movie delivered . Like all out street warfare through the slums of the city , different gangs using different weapons . Shotguns , rifles , RPGs ...

1 I think a London gangster / heist movie would be right up his street .

1 The first one , yes .

1 It 's also a 14 year old movie , so I do n't think you can use it as an example when discussing if the mystery genre is currently dead .

1 Okay ?

1 I know there 's been an abundance of Cornetto posts recently , so I 'm sorry to everyone who I piss off with this , especially cause it 's not offering much in the way of new information . I 've just been watching them on repeat cause they 're some of my favorite movies .

1 I am annoyed I never knew about this . Edit : I can not spell 'knew ' . I have shamed myself .

1 A bunch of unknowns . There 's a trillion talented actors out there , let 's stop fawning over the .001 % .

1 Haha it 's funny cuz you said part

1 It will be available on US Netflix starting April 14 .

1 The kind of movie that just leaves you staring after it ends .

1 Uhh , all scores are soundtracks , my friend . They apply in this thread .

1 No Jonah , snorting real cocaine in a Scorsese movie is pretty iconic .

1 Holy shit , TIL ...

1 I do n't think anyone expectes it to be `` Good '' we expect it to be `` good '' because The Rock is fucking awesome .

1 I can see that , because to be honest , Taken is * just * another action movie where the tough-guy protagonist incidentally knows everything required to kill people in specific situations . It could easily have had Jason Statham is the lead . But in that genre , it 's probably one of the best movies since Die Hard . Maybe because it has a serious , occasionally dramatic actor in the lead , maybe not .

1 Awesome ! The trailer features a hot woman riding a goat , escapees from Norwegian black metal bands , religious imagery , majestic classical music and chants of Satan . No telling if this will be a proper horror movie or more of the glorious fucked up'ness that is House of 1000 corpses and The Devil 's Rejects . Either way I 'll watch it .

1 Exactly . The movie looks like the comic , but it does n't feel like the comic . The translation from comic to movie is mostly superficial and many elements of the comic are lost and the changes made in the movie only emphasise this ( the ending has already been mentioned , but smaller changes like having Silk Spectre say the line `` Nothing ever ends '' has a significant impact on the film as a whole ) . Also , I did n't think the movie was awful , just not nearly as good as the comic .

1 For years and years , there was a small independent theater in Blacksburg , VA , that would - once a year - show the Princess Bride in a midnight showing . It always sold out , and people would quote the move , line for line . Of course , then the theater went hipster and is too good for this ( and Rocky Horror ) anymore . But it was amazing while it lasted .

1 The Robe : about the roman legionnaire who won Christ 's robe in a dice game , and his path to redemption . It was also the first film shot in CinemaScope . Ben Hur : winner of eleven oscars , this film follows the titular character on an epic journey that interweaves with the life of Jesus Christ .

1 China already has a bootleg copy .

1 I still think about this often . And I first watched it around the same age . Crazy

1 I looked at it as more of Bane almost taunting Bruce by relating him to someone younger who may not be as experienced as the Batman should be .

1 Yeah I agree , I find it extremely hard to believe any of this .

1 Me too , but the story is so absurd that I had to keep reading to find out what happened . Music , scary ; story , not scary .

1 The horrible remake ? Not exactly the high point of his career .

1 Yes , * my * other hand . The one I masturbate with .

1 In his defense , he was doing this all in one take , talking as fast as he could . It 's pretty easy to trip over your own words in a situation like that .

1 This commentary is one of my all time favorites ... they give a ton of behind the scenes info and they are cracking up the entire time . Well worth checking out for sure !

1 He 's definitely not a very good actor , but at least for the first film I find his lack of ability somewhat fitting as the character of Luke is this out of his element youth who 's just starting his grand adventure .

1 It 's a picture of the entire Universe . The Earth just happens to be in the foreground .

1 Ca n't come soon enough ( Since they waited three years after MoS to start it )

1 I tried the Burger King one too . I did n't think it was good despite my excitement for a black burger .

1 I worked in a video store in the 80 's . Finding titles on the shelf was all about spotting the box ( Beta , then VHS ) from memory of renting it over and over again . If the movie boxes today look like the posters it would be more of a challenge to spot those unique boxes . Back then the only commonality that I remember was often the studio name and some other info . I remember being easily able to find these boxes because of their individual designs : [ Scarface ] ( http : / bilder.filmundo.de / filmundo_bilder / picture_12.php ? id_of_gebot=3863693 & size=st & idx=01 & tkey=e90e0e6dec6ff1e156c3c47809e07272 ) [ Ghostbusters ] ( http : / www.videocollector.co.uk / data / images / ghostbusters-1984-922l.jpg ) [ Star Wars ] ( http : / 1.bp.blogspot.com / -jWw7eU7KrU8 / TrdPIfyYb8I / AAAAAAAAAp0 / afJqbpSUnww / s1600 / Star+Wars+VHS+cover+1982.jpg ) Studios like Fox ( the Star Wars box ) had common styling - that grey top / bottom with horizontal lines .

1 Let 's not judge her entire personality based on one video of her reacting to something in which she does n't have much interest . That said , I wanted to strangle her . Edit : MRW http : / new2.fjcdn.com / comments / You % 20you % 20 % 20_1893643e0d5edd3714fc680f2d03c394.png

1 > Meanwhile , Futurama keeps calling the studio ? 30th Century Fox ? . I like that part of the article . It made me chuckle .

1 and an average rating of 7.9 which is a very good sign . Should end up with at least 70 % .

1 Goodfellas is amazing .

1 Same here man , I was rooting for that cat in some weird way , he probably wants out of that house after bitch comes back all bloody .

1 To my understanding they were going to do a trilogy . Second one was when dredd goes out into the cursed earth , and the third about the dark judges .

1 Ranger , Champ , Scout , Buckaroo ,

1 `` I AM A FALSE PROPHET AND GOD IS A SUPERSTITION ! '' ... ... . `` Those areas have been drilled . ''

1 You get a very similar vibe in the book , so it seems to be cast pretty well

1 Shit , thanks for following your own point .

1 The issue with those pics is that they are all photoshopped to look like the character he plays .

1 Haha ! `` Kids are weird these days ... The fuck are those things ? '' Looks good !

1 Everyone gets frustrated at work sometimes . Just proves he 's human .

1 Yeah but in the awesome land of not the U.S. , things were better . Funny how that has n't changed .

1 In 2002 it was the [ largest Somali population in North America ] ( http : / www.immigrationpolicy.org / sites / default / files / docs / New_Americans_in_the_North_Star_State_2009.pdf ) .

1 Honestly the factor that truly sets it apart for me is that it 's honest and sentimental and does n't give a fuck . It is sincere and uncynical . It is n't crass . That does n't totally excuse some poor dialogue and lack characterization but it is an original property with a heart , making it a rare bird . It is getting to the point where you have to put on a Nolan layer of `` grim and gritty '' to get audiences not to roll their eyes . It is a fantasy concept that , like most kaiju movies , does n't take itself too seriously . The characters are broad but have worthwhile relationships with one another . I could have done without the romantic nature of Mako and Becket 's relationship but it 's based on mutual respect , making it unlike most movie relationships . Sadly any time you bring an original concept to nerds it will quickly be savaged by them . Yeah giant monsters and robots have appeared in other things . Who knew ? ? ? ? God forbid it wear its influences on its sleeve . It 's an original idea , heartfelt and epic in the actual sense of that word , making it a great movie but not the kind of movie a disappointing chunk of the world wants right now . The notoriety of Sharknado is kind of poignant . A lot of people would rather make fun of something that is trying to be made fun of than enjoy something with a heart . I 'll be seeing it for the third time in a couple of days . Hopefully that is true of a few other people as well .

1 ( It 's Joseph Campbell , not Conrad . ) But yeah , it 's the same basic story theme that made Star Wars . And basically probably 75 % of movies / stories out there . It 's not some genius new idea . ( If you 're at all a fan of Community , here 's a good read about Dan Harmon using it for the show : http : / gointothestory.blcklst.com / 2012 / 02 / how-dan-harmon-drives-himself-crazy-making-community.html ) For more information : http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Monomyth ( it 's also called the `` monomyth '' and was around even before Campbell wrote about it in the 40 's , just was n't strictly laid out ) .

1 Wall-E fits too . This would be cool

1 The system heard Bond say `` double '' which it pre-emptively filled with w ( double u ) , when he finished it as `` double e '' instead of `` double u '' the system corrected it 's mistake

1 Or better yet , /r/pacificrim

1 Yeah , I do n't even know what that means .

1 I mean , I never claimed it was historically accurate and I do n't really care one way or the other honestly .

1 I think Reed definitely kept some of Wright 's stuff in , and probably tweaked them to fit his own vision . For instance , in the latest ( ? ) trailer , the Thomas the Tank Engine sequence screamed Edgar Wright , in the sense that it was an off-kilter , more kinetic form of comedy that relied on editing and the camera , rather than simply a trail of words coming out of a character 's mouth . And then juxtapose that with the tone deaf comedic exchanges Rudd has with Michael Douglas and Corey Stoll . I hope there is more of the Thomas the Tank Engine-esque comedy rather than the former , or Ant-Man will certainly have jarring shifts in tone .

1 Half of these award shows are n't for cinema , you know , our world does n't revolve around movies . It 's just a nice thing to have . I also just answered a question without feeling superior .

1 Not sure why you 're being downvoted , you offered an opinion and explained it . I 've never met anyone who thought Avengers was the best movie they 've ever seen .

1 Yeah , but other people might have been enjoying it , if not for your yammering . That 's the point . The world does n't revolve around you .

1 Lots of blow .

1 Who the hell would cast a black guy as President ? As if that 's believable ...

1 Reddit 's got ta ease up on this . Every time someone posts screencaps praising a film 's cinematography they get nagged at for only posting random nice frames ... I work as a cinematographer for a living and I personally love these submissions , no we do n't get the movement or the context , but unless OP is going to post the entire film , lay off . Beautifully shot movie .

1 Zero is neither even nor odd .

1 Girl look at that body !

1 What two movies ?

1 You ca n't milk those tits .

1 : ( I really liked Under the Skin .

1 Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is the best thing to ever happen to the Temple of Doom .

1 Yes I love Hunger almost as much . Shame is my number 1 now though . Such an amazing film I ca n't get over it . Also the score is brilliant .

1 It does n't need a sequel , but they set it up to have the strong potential for one .

1 Did you know there 's actually like a dozen Exodus 8:2 signs all throughout the movie ? There 's one in the very first sequence ( on the roof ) , there 's one in the audience of the game show , and there 's a ton more I do n't remember off the top of my head .

1 Sorry about the mess .

1 Hmm , good question . My above comment was about the Old Testament , which is what Jewish people think of when they consider the bible . By and large , Christianity and the New Testament are not often discussed in the classical Judaic literature , which has a rather introverted bent . Many Christians like to interpret references to Jesus into the Old Testament , but in my experience those either revolve around mistranslations or forced interpretations of slightly ambiguous sentences . One of the few exceptions I can think of is that the Talmud does make possible references to Jesus and the early Christian movement . This is actually a big subject of debate , which you can read more about [ here ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Jesus_in_the_Talmud ) . Generally speaking , religious Jews think of Jesus as a false messiah . They do not believe in the resurrection , certainly , and there is no consensus on how much of the story in the New Testament is true . Many believe that he existed ( i.e. a messianic figure named `` Yeshu '' ) , and it is certain that a messiah-like figure would have been prosecuted by the Sanhedrin ( Jewish supreme court ) . Seeing as crucifixion was not an uncommon form of capital punishment , it is n't necessarily hard to believe that he was crucified . However , most of the other details of the story are n't taken too seriously , as many Jews believe it likely that those details were fabricated later . Read more [ here ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Judaism's_view_of_Jesus ) and [ here ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Historicity_of_Jesus # The_Talmud ) .

1 Wow , thanks North Korea !

1 Hey ! Wookies can have families too you know !

1 And he has the same name !

1 `` first file of the day ''

1 At the end of the movie , the girl and the guy decide to move to the city where he knows drug dealers . This is where requiem for a dream starts - with them living together and him being a drug dealer

1 Only in the extended universe . Which you always have to take with a grain of salt .

1 That came out last year .

1 That movie was great ; very Hitchcockian .

1 Unfortunately I can not provide proof , but my sisters boyfriend works for Legendary Pictures under the owner & invited me to watch it with him at Warner Brother Studios in LA .

1 Not OP , but he mentioned that he uses ZBrush to do these .

1 Never heard of him , let me imdb his name -- Buffy and Angel ... that 's good . Cloverfield , I liked that one- Cabin in the Woods , Word War Z ... I liked both -- Daredevil the series ? Big fan . I 'm okay with the man , frankly .

1 I pretty much always imagined that too . Basically he 's scamming the British government for booze and women , and getting away with it because he 's apparently the only guy who can save Britain from Russians and terrorists

1 If you have n't already , do yourself a favour and skip the movies but get the actual series . They both have a lot of good content that was edited out to make it movie length .

1 I want to listen so badly but then again I want to hear it first in the movie for the impact .

1 you gon eat yo conbreh ?

1 Ugh they threw her in this ? Goddamit .

1 Hahah I may have burst into a fit of giggles when kid Magneto was screaming . It just looked / sounded so HILARIOUS .

1 Be sure to head over to /r/dvdcollection to let them know and to join the fun !

1 Considering the entire movie is funny , that would mean the trailer is the length of the movie .

1 I really enjoy it . It 's just a mess .

1 I personally loved its premise , cinematography and score . 3 things that personally are important for me to love a film . I thought it built tension very well , better then most Horror movies I 've seen . Its premise allows for any shot to build tension , making the audience scan the frame to see if an `` It '' is approaching . I also liked the characters even when we do n't get to know much about them . They felt relatable and thats important for characters that do n't have much else to them . I also enjoyed the relationships the girl had with her two male friends , the one who tricked her into thinking he cared and the one that actually did . I was n't a huge fan of the final act but I did n't dislike it . Some people dislike how little the curse is explained . I do n't really understand this argument when there are so many villains in movies that people love that have no backstory , and I would consider this entity a villain . It kills people , you run , that 's it . You are confused about it as the characters are .

1 Yes , they 're just not as prominent .

1 I was n't expecting it to win an Oscar , but I * was * expecting it to be funny . So far , the trailers have been a disappointment .

1 That 's Benicio Del Toro , who plays The Collector .

1 Half of Emma 's money is still a fortune too .

1 Every scene

1 No no no . He 's playing Batman not the Joker .

1 That 's interesting . I always just thought Red Apple cigarettes were the intention all along , similar to Big Kahuna Burger , rather than something created out of necessity . Of course , it makes more sense that way .

1 That 's my thought also

1 on IMDB the movie is called [ U.F.O ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt2040578 / ) and it has a 3.1 rating .

1 no movie trailer is complete without the themes from sunshine and thin red line , apparently .

1 I strongly second this .

1 Seriously , fuck everything about that film

1 > The other fanboys are Hutch ( Dan Fogler ) , who lives in his mother 's garage coach house , and Windows ( Jay Baruchel ) , who changed his name from MacOS . Just kidding . Windows , Hutch and Linus work in a comic bookstore , where their favorite customer is Zoe ( Kristen Bell ) . She 's sexy and a `` Star Wars '' fan . How cool is that ? She 's almost better than the date who turns into a pizza and a six-pack when the deed is done . I 'm a Roger Ebert Fanboy

1 `` ( sigh ) ... it 's like living with a six-year-old . ''

1 Special effects had nothing to do with why Green Lantern was bad . The characters just sucked and were unlikable .

1 I believe you mean [ Day Bow Bow . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=hg4BBUKJdok )

1 The campaign to lower the film 's ratings was a direct response to Kirk 's own campaign to raise them . He called upon his followers to give the movie a good rating , * even if they had n't seen it * .

1 I think it fell through . This was probably 4 years ago . I 'm friends with her on Facebook and I have not seen anything posted about it for a few years . After we dropped her as a client she kept posting asking people for money to finish it but people obviously were n't helping .

1 I 'm fine with Irons as Alfred . He fits song with the Earth One version , but Eisenberg as Lex ? I just ca n't see that being good at all . My hopes for this flick are dropping faster than fruit flies .

1 Domhnall Gleeson is killing it . About Time , Frank , Calvary , and soon SW7 , The Revenant and Ex Machina .

1 They 're going more Romita style with the suit , which is outstanding . Best looking on screen suit to date !

1 Prince Humperdinck . What a jerk !

1 Storing dead niggers ai n't my fucking business ! !

1 Implying the Marvel movies are n't ultra clich ? . All comic book movies so far have the biggest clich ? plots .

1 > Why could n't they just say they are * amish * ? Why the need for two hours of * horseshit * ? Reminds me of Robin Williams joke ( from Live on Broadway , 2003 ) `` If you see an Amish guy with his hand buried in a horse 's ass , he 's the mechanic ''

1 Popular things are liked by the general population ?

1 That a alterative history movie .

1 A happy midget .

1 and ... . You get that Maleficent is a spin on Sleeping Beauty too , right ?

1 My point exactly . Whatever .

1 What do you mean ? This is BRILLIANT ! Did n't you see the blurry picture of Jim Carrey running on the basketball court ? !

1 I feel like that might be a bit of a stretch . Chances are it was totally coincidental .

1 I 'd pay to see him blow up the Sarlaac from the inside though .

1 * First successful attempt .

1 I think it 's more like his mustache has become sentient and started auditioning for roles on its own .

1 People saw that coming from the * minute * he was slated to direct but did anyone actually guess it would be [ Agent Coulson ? I mean , I actually thought it was going to be Pepper ( The movie almost seemed to set up to be her too , with the exchange between her and Tony , it seemed * too * perfect ) . I saw a lot of guesses but I think Phil flew under everyone 's radar ] ( / spoiler )

1 Kubrick definitely springs to mind . Such a distinctive style .

1 It 's the [ Production / Animation Company ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Laika_ % 28company % 29 ) that 's the same , not that that makes much difference .

1 Such a unique film . The whole thing feels like a dream ; floaty shots of the beautiful Italian coastal town Polignano a Mare juxtaposed with creepy , dark , intrigue . It 's as much of ( probably more of ) a romance and self-discovery film than a horror . The way it 's shot and the natural dialogue make it feel like you 're and omnipresent spectator watching this relationship unfold . You have to keep a bit of an open mind with the plot , if you 're really cynical about it you probably wo n't like it . My favorite film of 2015 so far . Moorhead and Benson just seem like two pretty down-to-earth [ ( and hilarious ) ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=iR8q6bItfGI ) dudes who love making awesome movies .

1 This makes me so happy to see other people mention Speed Racer . I watch it regularly and it 's easily one of my favorite movies , so it makes me happy that other people know about it and liked it : D

1 [ King Kamehameha ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Kamehameha_I )

1 MACHETE !

1 I feel you . r / movies had me convinced that Oldboy was some kind of masterpiece that would give me a serious mindfuck . Besides some cool scenes ( I did love the way the hammer fight scene was filmed ) , I was very underwhelmed .

1 Sorry reddit , he totally deserved it . It just cracks me up to think that only a few years ago he was doing crummy romantic comedies . I love seeing him get some compelling roles .

1 Get out . ^Just ^kidding , ^enjoy ^what ^you ^want . ^^^But ^^^I ^^^hate ^^^the ^^^sequels .

1 Yeah.. Understood , I 'm saying it 's a common place for violence in general . You 're talking about a place with loads of people in dark rooms with loud noises and little to no security .

1 No one was forced to give him their money , they chose to do it . He did n't promise to make films that the fans would deem perfect . That does n't exempt him from criticism , but too many people seem to personally hate him and act like he is a horrible human being all because the films were n't what they wanted .

1 [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` Definately . When he kissed her on her forehead when she was dead , I really felt sad . '' )

1 I 've never written a screenplay . And even if I had , I think it 's stupid to even try to answer that , especially without having seen what he 's written . If it 's great ? Apparently he spent enough time on it . If it sucks ? Maybe it would n't have been any better if he spent another 15 years on it . He wrote Jay and Silent Bob in like 3 days . It took Axel Rose 10 years to release Chinese Democracy . Time is irrelevant , and it 's especially pointless to speculate on the time he 's spent writing when we have n't even seen a single page yet .

1 Yeah was hoping someone would mention this . So simple .

1 I 'm not sure the Geneva conventions apply to Zombies .

1 That 's beautiful

1 There was a TV series in the ( I think ) 60 's called The Avengers . I imagine that would factor into it .

1 Well , fuck . Spoilers , man ! now there 's no point in seeing it .

1 Upvote , because of your right to love shitty movies .

1 It 's gon na be pretty hard to overcome that childish monotone voiceover .

1 I am as pumped up for this movie as I was for the dark knight rises . I keep telling my non-believing friends that the director is a badass and they never quite connect . I 'm totally going to it

1 Based off of Truman Capote , I believe .

1 Yeah I think the raptors will end up being kind of a chaotic neutral where you really do n't know if they 'll be helpful when they show up or not . I think it could be interested .

1 I love how my current film professor describes it : `` Right away you know how evil he is , because he * shoots a ginger kid in the face * ! ''

1 this was just playing on all the Mayan prophecies . i quite liked that part . how to put the fear of god into angry mayan warriors ? bring up god and prophecies .

1 I 've never seen the version without the shitty Tumblr filter . Nice .

1 check him out on The Mighty Boosh , he is awesome there too and nothing like the other two roles you mentioned .

1 Nah , I think a big budget remake would just ruin what Primer is .

1 The kid did n't get the joke . It said something about how Charlie Chaplin died before cell phones were even invented and that it was n't therefore possible to have one in his film .

1 But I ca n't get them right now .

1 Walt Whitman was a real person , died before movies were invented , and was n't really antiheroic . I 'm incredibly confused by this comment .

1 Dat impromptu Thriller dance..

1 I really liked The Last Exorcism but it really seems to split the audience between people who like it and people who hate it . The story of the preacher who had lost all of his faith and through the movie going to expose the frauds of fake exorcisms . It 's well worth a watch for sure .

1 IP BAN HIM !

1 Rekt

1 Agreed . Bummer that the rest of the movie was kinda crappy .

1 Okay , pretend the key members of parliament are various governments , and the psychic is Wikileaks . It 's pretty simple .

1 Groundhog Day

1 This is exactly it . I know he 's not even been in a lot but I 'm tired of seeing his name absolutely everywhere in this sub .

1 Actually , that 's Catch-22 not Slaughterhouse-5 .

1 I 'd almost say she looks better now than she did then .

1 Michael Caine ? Really ?

1 I did n't * love * it , but I think 14^th place is pretty reasonable .

1 That 's what 's great about it though , you had seen so little before that point and you really were n't sure what to think . Then demonfire and axe murders .

1 Naming her kid Batmo is no longer an option . Batmotimberlake just does n't roll off the tongue as well .

1 It 's war Peacock !

1 [ You Rang ? ] ( http : / toomanyposts.files.wordpress.com / 2013 / 08 / armageddon-buscemi.jpg )

1 I believe that 's the case . Similar to how they departed from Hank Pym ( Ant-Man ) creating Ultron . And there 's a strong case for JARVIS becoming Vision solely based on the voice actor playing both . JARVIS ' AI is remarkable , so I can definitely see them developing on that and creating Vision .

1 I 'll go first : At the end of `` Life Aquatic , '' when Zissou finally spots the Jaguar Shark . [ This song ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=k574ZlzTo_I & feature=related ) is playing . I lose it .

1 ? Like the only good guy in that movie the dies is Goose .

1 that 's a great franchise . Any trilogy that does justice and has a completed feel should not be redone .

1 Still unfunny .

1 Yes , it can be .

1 Which is absurd .

1 Thank you for your concern . It exceeded my expectations , which had been set low by Iron Man 2 . You can [ read my thoughts on Iron Man 3 here ] ( http : / dejareviewer.com / 2013 / 05 / 14 / iron-man-3-is-what-iron-man-2-should-have-been / ) , if you like .

1 Have n't seen the movie but after seeing those pics I 'm not understanding what the big deal is .

1 I hope [ Harbinger Down ] ( http : / www.kickstarter.com / projects / 1117671683 / harbinger-down-a-practical-creature-fx-film ) attempts to 1 up this scene .

1 The scene where Baker 's character is talking to his kid about masturbation was really disturbing to me .

1 -- > Galaxy Quest ( comedy ensemble but IN SPACE )

1 Hahah , I saw that too after I posted , that 's probably not a good thing .

1 Because there 's three different versions . 2D , 3D and 3D with HFR .

1 Wow . Homophobic internet tough guy . How ... quaint . So you just raged and said absolutely nothing of substance in that entire tirade . I confess that I might never be able to see your `` point '' since it seems like you might never be able to string together a series of words ( big or small ! ) into a coherent , logical thought . Let 's try and break down this mess that you might think is writing ( or um ... making a `` point '' ) : > ALL of the marvel movies have consistent comic relief , corny lines , and cliches.. including the avengers . ... um ... so what ? Are Batman Begins , The Dark Knight & Man of Steel completely devoid of `` comic relief , corny lines and cliches '' ? That 's what you cited as paramount examples of Superhero movies , right ? I say this as a huge Nolan fanboy ( and a big fan of Man of Steel ) , but to even remotely entertain the idea that those films do n't have `` comic relief , corny lines and cliches '' is laughable . These are * summer blockbusters * we 're talking about . They are the pinnacle of movie `` entertainment '' and rake in hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office * precisely * because they are funny ( aka `` comic relief '' ) , absurd ( aka `` corny lines '' ) and familiar ( aka `` cliches '' ) . I hate to break it to you , but these summer blockbuster superhero films will never be some kind of methodical character study akin to There Will Be Blood . > How you 're able to distinguish ( scary big word ) the avengers , considering the accumulation ( a big word ) of all the characters , is illogical . If * you * ca n't make the logical leap in your oh-so-superior brain that allows you to believe a super soldier , billionaire playboy , Norse god and giant green monster can be in one place at the same time then that 's your own problem . Seriously . You might have a preference towards `` gritty realism '' in superhero films , but that does n't mean that any comic book movie which does n't embrace that style is objectively * bad * . It just means that you wo n't personally like it , which is ... fine . What 's not fine is going around belittling other people for having different opinions ( especially when you clearly struggle to make any kind of cogent argument ) . ... All of that said , I just feel sorry for you . You seem way too cynical and miserable to appreciate the fact we 're actually going through a golden-age for comic book films right now . So I hope you 're at least having fun while hating everything and spewing negativity left and right .

1 Or this movie had a limited released in a handful of markets and only the critics in those markets cities had a chance to see it .

1 No clue . I like that he clearly had no interest in sounding like a civilized person either . Literally said I 'm an idiot for liking a movie that he did n't like . Jesus Christ .

1 Basically anything with Arnold .

1 It 's the same as HD mastered DVDs back in the day . For Blurays they edit it in 4k and scale it down to 1080p , which retains more image detail than normaly .

1 It 's going to be interesting to see how they make us care enough to see a dedicated film about them , but then also make us hate them to still cheer on Spiderman to defeat them in ASM3 .

1 Great villain , great story , with great action

1 Maybe I 'm giving them too much credit here , but I just assumed they were going for a classic promotional poster look . Like something they 'd put outside a magic show in Atlantic City .

1 haters gon na hate ... i can appreciate how long it toke you to do this ... nice job its pretty sweet

1 The idea that the kids are being monitored is revealed in the first five minutes of the movie .

1 So what ? Luke has to look just as fit when he 's ~60 ? Same with Leia . It 's natural .

1 I think so , but it does n't work . The shots linger for too long , and barely synch with the music . The lighting is too bright , and the clips chosen do n't seem very ominous . This screams of `` angst '' and `` DAE edgy ? ! '' and * not * anything actually dark .

1 Any movie where he can run around screaming insanity is perfect for him .

1 Really ? I love the rhythm of both titles , I think they 're fun to say .

1 Master and Commander . It is great .

1 [ Shut the fuck up , Donny . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=MjYJ7zZ9BRw )

1 It 's more complicated than that . There is a murder in the * Lion King * , sure . There is not a massacre in which a character starts slicing through other characters as they beg for their lives and scramble for the exits . There is not a scene in which a character is implied to massacre a room full of terrified , hiding children . There is not a scene where a character has their limbs hacked off and is subsequently burned alive .

1 Oh .

1 That guy is not from `` There 's Something About Mary .

Some minor characters do n't show up in trailers , it 's not a big surprise .

1 I would buy it if he sold it on his website .

1 Honestly , who the fuck cares about the acting.. I think that is the problem with the first , it was too serious ! The second one was awesome . Although I do love the the scene with Crews walking down the corridor firing the AA12 ! BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM I laugh my ass off every time I see it..

1 How was it Stand By Me meets Spielberg ? The kids in Stand By Me were looking for a dead body , Super-8 they were making a movie . Plus there were n't any major adult characters like Kyle Chandler 's Sheriff in Stand By Me .

1 No , actually Patrick Jean . https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ou8vRWTSsJo

1 Johnny Depp is a bit shy , and it is difficult to understand this , assuming you are n't a screen actor , but it is EXTREMELY embarrassing to watch yourself act , especially on the big screen . You know every fault , every screw up , everything you could have done better . It does n't matter if nobody else does , it makes you really self-conscious . Now , does that mean he has n't bothered ? Maybe , he could easily be exaggerating , but watching yourself act is a very hard thing to get through .

1 Fire it up ! Fire it up !

1 Yup . You know she 's hot when she looks like someone with a healthy meth addiction and she still is hot .

1 > your joke suck your grammar suck

1 IMDB would n't know a good movie if it hit them in the back of the head with a shovel .

1 Oh you know it

1 Shut the fuck up Donny . Youre like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie and wants to know .

1 I liked how they did n't even just fight eachother in after a buch of build-up , they fought a shitload of times and kicked eachother 's asses .

1 I thought it was an inventive way of building character . Aldous thought that a threeway was a legitimate method of reconciling . That 's how messed up he is . Plus , he 's so charismatic that he gets the other two to go along with it . It leads to even more conflict and a unique ending .

1 Did n't their batteries last for 120 years ? EDIT : Yup. : ) http : / terminator.wikia.com / wiki / Series_800 # Technical_data

1 How the fuck was that ending predictable ? ? I can understand not liking the ending but it definitely was n't predictable . I see how you can not like Interstellar , but objectively it 's a good film . There 's a difference between not liking something and saying something is bad .

1 No , I heavily disagree with this . The X-Men movies ( well , most of them ) have maintained positive reception amongst fans . The problem with Amazing Spider-Man 2 is story . It 's an unfocused mishmash of ideas that are terribly executed and unanswerable questions such as `` what is this movie about '' because it is n't about anything .

1 Half in the Bag on Red Letter Media 's site is a wonderful mix of purposely-absurd acting and plotlines and well thought-out long-form comments and criticism .

1 Once every now and then , I stop playing with my pocket-sized computer with access to the wealth of human knowledge to watch the planes to the far side of the world take people for a weekend break where they carry with them their libraries in a piece of plastic the size of a DVD case . Thinking of DVDs , I remember my favourite show will have been downloaded for me , so I head home to watch it on my 42 '' flat-screen TV . Fuck , man . The * future * .

1 The Martian I just finished the book and it 's a great sci-fi thriller that is absolutely perfect for the big screen . It already has terrific potential to be a really good movie - outstanding cast ( Matt Damon , Jessica Chastain , Jeff Daniels , Kate Mara , Donald Glover , Micheal Pe ? a , Sean Bean , Sebastian Stan , Chiwetal Ejofer , and Kristen Wiig ) , a really good screenwriter ( Drew Goddard ) and a great leading man in Matt Damon . Ridley Scott as the director is the only thing I 'm worried about , considering he has n't made a really good movie in a long time . The last movie he made that I liked was American Gangster , which was 8 years ago ( the last movie he made that I loved was Gladiator which was 15 years ago ) . Since then , he 's done Prometheus , Exodus , Body of Lies , Robin Hood and The Counselor - movies that are divisive at best . Hopefully his return to directing a Damon-Lindelof-free sci-fi movie will also be a return to form for the director .

1 I definitely agree that the problem with the Stallone Dredd is that they were trying to do way too many things , and as a result none of them really were fully fleshed out . I loved the design of Mean Machine and it 's a complete shame he got all of about 10 minutes of screen time at most . Same with the ABC warrior . ( Actually I loved the ABC warrior and I think he is a big reason why I got so interested in prop building and practical effects , because he was very obviously not an actor inside a plastic suit . But I digress . ) I hope they make a sequel to the 2012 Dredd and that they explore more things in the lore , but with the same tight focus that the first one had . Sci-fi movies suffer greatly from `` have to save the world '' syndrome , and it was refreshing to see that Dredd was a small and self-contained story .

1 That 's a totally reasonable point , and one I had n't really considered . Thanks !

1 I love the opening titles for Enter The Void . especially the last few seconds . For me , there are two things that make me enjoy it so much . The first is that it gets you super pumped to watch a fairly trippy movie . The second , is thinking about how long it must have taken the editors to make it . I also happen to like LFO who supplies the song during the opening title sequence .

1 They make Best of Worst all the time , which is awesome . Honestly if they made Plinkett reviews every two months it 'd get stale . I prefer they reserve Plinkett for Star Wars / Star Trek and things that are truly critically bad

1 You 're right , i 'm sorry : )

1 I 'd imagine most people watched that because it was a Wes Anderson movie , though yeah , point taken , it was cool seeing him playing something different .

1 That 's just precious

1 I felt the same , except it felt out of tune for me the entire time .

1 LOUDEST BABY EVER

1 That looks pretty damn cool

1 Always that one guy in every thread .

1 Four of these asian picture album posters on one comment ... What the hell is up with that anyway ?

1 Thank you ! We 're very happy to be a part of the community where people can have a fun and affordable night together as a family !

1 Such an underrated Joker quote . It really sums up just how powerless Batman is in that interaction with the Joker - he 's captured him , but only because Joker planned to be captured and has already engineered an escape , and the Joker 's about to destroy the two biggest hopes in his life ( Rachel as Bruce Wayne 's hope for a normal , happy life , and Harvey Dent as Batman 's hope for a legitimate future for Gotham )

1 such a milf

1 I do n't think he knew at the time they were all heading to SF .

1 Bryan Singer .

1 Only God Forgives did better after it left theaters because it was a barely marketed indie movie . All indie movies fit that bill . I do n't see people , say , 10 years from now spending much time talking about that movie , because even though I thought it was pretty good , there 's nothing really remarkable or noteworthy about it imo . The one movie that jumps out at me is The World 's End because it was great and all of the great Simon Pegg / Nick Frost / Edgar Wright movies end up being cult classics .

1 He is a one-note hack that has n't ever made a movie that was n't just two hours of violence porn . Yes he has , Spy Kids 1-4 , Sharkboy and Lava Girl , and Shorts . The Faculty too .

1 Goodfellas

1 Why is n't anyone ever just whelmed ?

1 Oh man , the assault on Aqaba still blows my mind to this day .

1 That 's funny , because all the reviews I 've read and watched , Ridley Scott 's been raked over the coals for plot holes .

1 It does indeed

1 If the suit comes out of his skin , I will literally shit myself .

1 Same here dude .

1 Way , WAY too big / spread out . You 're much more likely to get to see the Mistborn series at some point , it would lend itself pretty well to film , I think .

1 It might struggle . The bitrate is extremely high , higher than your average Blu-Ray .

1 That 's a great idea . It would give the people an opportunity to tell the mpaa to go fuck themselves when the NC17 blows the R version out of the water .

1 It 's tree fiddy .

1 It 's a cow 's opinion , as in , it does n't matter .

1 What

1 Right . As it is the Disneyland resort , I 'm consider calling it all `` Disneyland '' as being valid . Just like if someone says `` I went to Disneyworld '' I know they could have meant any of the parks contained within the Disney World Resort .

1 That Joaquin Phoenix fella .

1 Forever Stallone ?

1 All of that `` luck '' is pretty accurate to the source material .

1 You can tell its her by the way you ca n't see her face at all .

1 It comes down to this . If a vfx company decides to not to go into India , India receives no tax dollars from that company and Indian citizens that may have been employed by that company do n't receive any salary that would be completely funded with money originating in the US via US movie studios . If a company decides to go into India , they are putting some cost against the Indian infrastructure ( using roads , getting buildings approved , etc ) , although an incredibly small one compared to other businesses considering their product is completely digital and does n't require the movement of any sort of goods or require any kind of regulation . The tax dollars they do pay , which is greater than the zero dollars they would have paid had they not gone into India , certainly offsets their use of the local infrastructure several times over . More importantly , they bring a much much greater amount of money from America into India than the tax break they receive . So India and its taxpayers all benefit monetarily from having a vfx company do work there .

1 Klaus should have his own trilogy . And still remain a minor character in them .

1 Already own it . Bought it from the french Amazon in steelbook , very good film .

1 Gon na need a source on the whole divorce thing before we start judging buddy

1 It is indeed we call it a rooter because we pronounce route as root and it 's just carried over .

1 Black Dynamite . Absolutely hilarious .

1 [ Troll Hunter ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1740707 / ) is pretty good .

1 Heard great things about this . Really looking forward to it .

1 I think they 're saving Trejo for a potential 4th movie , set in the seedy underground of the Colombian jungle . He 's probably gon na be a [ submarine captain ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Narco-submarine ) named Captain Machete or something .

1 Because he played himself

1 Oh yeah , I understand all that . But for some reason I just ca n't like it .

1 Not to mention that the Latin text / lyrics sung by the chorus in the background are typical of [ Catholic Requiem Masses ( Masses for the Dead ) ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Requiem ) . I think that level of detail and the powerful music with the organ and chorus in the background make it that much better !

1 Firstly , it does n't autoplay for me . And second , the music is fairly mellow throughout the video .

1 If you think about it . Flintstones is the original Family Guy . Dumb fat husband , hot red head wife , comical small child and animals .

1 I like the idea ! I 'm no hater . That said it 's not gon na happen

1 5 minutes ... 5 months ... maybe

1 End of season 3 is n't exactly something everyone watching the show should be expected to know . It 's not like something that happens at the beginning of the first season .

1 And the source was a kids book to boot .

1 and you need great acotrs , great editors , great DP , great lighting , great costume , great FX , etc etc . A director is a like a manager . Managers always get credit for the work of the team .

1 I 'd suggest watching them again with normal expectations and paying close attention to the plot , characters , and how things are connected . I 've seen them several times and I feel like I see / understand new things about them each time ( applies to parts 1 and 2 only ) .

1 Bear me to it

1 Well Ironforge existed in the world and timeline of the RTS games , it was just never directly involved in the plot in any way . But I do n't see why they could n't include it , unless the movie is going to be like a shot-for-shot version of the games ' plot .

1 It 's not my canon . You can argue that because it 's been `` canonized '' by an `` official source , '' I have to accept it . I do n't . I do n't acknowledge the entity of 20th Century Fox as an authority on the Alien franchise . They 'd canonize the instruction manual of an Aliens-themed suppository if it meant it would make them more money . Let me know when someone with actual * artistic * authority over the franchise , like * any * of the directors ( even Fincher and Jeunet have more authority than Fox as far as I 'm concerned ) or the original creator of the Alien universe , says Colonial Marines is canon and then we 'll talk .

1 If James Gunn did n't cast him then he is an IDIOT AND A SAVAGE

1 So , by `` They 're making '' you mean `` Brad Bird has some ideas for ''

1 Dat fiss

1 Looks like he was misled by her too ...

1 You do realize that 's a problem with * you * , right ?

1 Actually in this case I thought the remake was better . Rooney Mara in particular was fantastic .

1 These look kinda ... terrible .

1 Jar Jar Binks cameo was hilarious . Hopefully he has a bigger role in the next installments . Glad he 's back .

1 It 's pomade , god dammit ! I 'm a Dapper Dan Man !

1 Ironically , everyone else in the room was supposed to be pissed and shocked while Dumbledore was supposed to be the only calm one . [ The book actually specifically says that he asked the question `` calmly . `` ] ( http : / imgur.com / aAvMpxv )

1 Bill had it coming . He was so coked out in that movie .

1 GwtDT 's was incredible . Never thought Led Zeppelin could be covered so well .

1 It 's a somewhat controversial opinion on this subreddit

1 Guillermo del Toro would do that to you ... Watch the exorcist with some chills , saw Candyman with a few thrill , Japanese version of the Ring was creepy . But I almost peed my pants every minute of the Orphanage .

1 Definitely Prisoners for me . Went in knowing nothing , and was totally blown away .

1 All the videogame cameos appear in like the first twenty minutes . The majority of the movie takes place in a racing arcade game , and has to do with the Ralph ( a videogame bad guy who wants recognition ) and Vanelope ( glitched character from the racing game shunned by the other normal racers ) help each other with their goals to prove their game-mates wrong .

1 I hate this in most fight scenes . Just cut every 0.5 seconds and it makes it seem intense . To me it 's really lazy and takes away from whatever movie . You do n't need several minutes uncut ( like the Protector or Oldboy ) , but at least show me a few seconds before cutting to a different angle .

1 no problem . i saw it a long time ago myself , and was struck by it . a little while ago i was listening to the soundtrack to warrior which mark isham conducted , and then remembered he also did the score for october sky . the [ main theme ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=IXKvtcUAJ3I ) is so ... somber . it really put the whole situation of the town ( that the youngsters were destined for the coal mines ) together . i 've loved it since watching back in '99 as a kid and rewatched it a few years ago . a really inspiring movie .

1 Amen . The * only * thing the movie had in common with the book ( other than zombies ) was the title .

1 Neither of those people would be liked by true `` hipsters '' . Depp and White are both really commercial . You can say you like Jack White but only on albums before Elephant OR you can say you like The Dead Weather . You can say The Dead Weather because Allison Mosshart is in that and she has never been commercially successful or done much of anything besides the KILLS . Its cool to hate depp , he does the same thing over and over and gets paid for it . None of these things `` hipsters '' support . Dead Man and Benni and Joon are the exception . Maybe The Libertine .

1 I can fap to this .

1 I kinda disagree on not having any big cgi cities.. Sometimes you got ta have those establishing shots on Coruscant or Kashyyk to actually see the beauty of their cities . Plus with modern day technologies I could imagine those scenes to be quite breathtaking !

1 I 'm not fat , but otherwise I was * that guy * last week at the gym . It was awesome .

1 Have you ever seen Inception ? The whole last hour is a CGI filled fuck fest

1 Great call , what a twist .

1 Yo its me . JeanRalfio with PC . Were so lucky to have someone to talk movie ! trivia..

1 Worst part is , I knew he was going to have to climb it without a rope . It was a classic Nolan twist .

1 Just recently watched `` All is Lost '' with Robert Redford . Kinda of an artfilm , no dialogue , just a story of a man and his boat . Worth the watch .

1 Right ? Plus Jack got the chance to show why he was a badass pirate .

1 Yeah ... but ... Malin Akerman ... boobs ... good .

1 If only this were true

1 I love the story behind this car .

1 They 're going to try , at least ?

1 No it 's not .

1 He did n't miss any joke , he is just acting ... very obnoxiously .

1 Oscars are run by educated old people , sci-fi is n't their thing .

1 That 's likely the point . The destruction caused is probably the main catalyst for the events that lead up to Civil War .

1 Yes , / u / tyranosisyphus_rex already pointed out my error . Sorry

1 No . Not this time , son .

1 `` Bite the curb '' scene in American History X has me cringeing every time .

1 -_-

1 EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC

1 Questions like `` why are these characters doing what they 're doing '' and `` why did my wife still buy me the Blu-ray when I said I hated this movie ``

1 That 's why black science guy says the black hole was a gentle one .

1 What do you think that opening scene from the framing device was ? It was obviously him in jail being grilled by a policeman , quite likely connected to his arrest for homosexuality .

1 Tryin ' to control what your kid sees , huh ? What are ya , some kind of movie Nazi ? ( wink )

1 His American accent is absolutely god awful .

1 Yeah , just not anything like in the movie . Bryan , the writer and director , was home alone growing up and heard a knock on his door . He did n't answer , but found out that the house next door , which had nobody home , got broken into that same night .

1 `` You crazy Jesus ! '' `` That 's what my ex-wife said '' * drives Corvette into exploding semi rig

1 The first 2 movies set up Wolverine * and * Rogue as the characters we follow ... and the 2nd one shifted focus to Jean , too , for the eventual Phoenix plotline ( which was mishandled in 3 ) . I mean , Wolverine has been the most popular in comics too , and then in the cartoon , long before the movies came about ... I do n't think its the movies fault that they cater to what the audience wants , and the reality is most of the audience really wants Wolverine front and center .

1 The interviewer was clearly aware of it from the first answer . He just decided to play along .

1 Please read the first sentence which explains what philosophy is . http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Philosophy EDIT : Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems , such as those connected with existence , knowledge , values , reason , mind , and language . Note where it says `` mind '' . And second , i respect your opinion that it was shitty filmmaking .

1 That was a classy refutation supported with a reasonable and coherent explanation . I do not think you are a douche .

1 I pictured Tiny Tim , from `` A Christmas Carol '' saying this , crutch and all .

1 No scene : Loki rightfully ( by succession rules ) crowns himself and dickishly betrays his family , not restoring Thor because he wants to keep power . With scene : Loki is rightfully ( by succession rules ) crowned by the people of Asgard , and does not lift Thor 's exile for the exact reasons he states in the film . He then proceeds to get carried away .

1 BEAR FUCKER , DO YOU NEED ASSISTANCE

1 * COMMENT CONTAINS SMALL SPOILERS , NOT SERIOUS ! * Wow ! I FRICKIN LOVED SINISTER ! It was really creepy . My favorite scene was when the ghosts of the children started coming out of nowhere and the guy did n't see them at all . It was amazing !

1 LOTR 3 , ROTJ , Indiana Jones 3 , Die Hard 3 , Borne Ultimatum , Back to the Future 3 . And with the first two films being absolutely amazing , you really should have faith . Argument status : Invalid

1 On December 14 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in the US , 20 children and eight adults were shot . 26 of them were killed . Four hours later at Chenpeng Village Primary School in China , 23 children and one adult was stabbed . None of them died .

1 What about making Marla 's mom into soap ? That shit is hilarious . > Long story short , Marla looked in the freezer . Okay , there was a little scuffle , first . I try to stop her , and the bag she 's holding gets dropped and breaks open on the linoleum and we both slip in the greasy white mess and come up gagging . I have Marla around the waist from behind , her black hair whipping my face , her arms pinned to her sides , and I 'm saying over and over , it was n't me . It was n't me . I did n't do it . `` My mother ! You 're spilling her all over ! ''

1 Wow ! That was a really cool video.. Covered like all my fav fight scenes great stuff ! ! Just wish it was longer ! !

1 No , I 'm not impressed either . It 's going to be some generic obvious twist at the end and lots of flashy meaningless cgi driven action . He 'll discover he 's been brainwashed by the enemy and the drones he 's reprogramming are hunter-killers that seek out human survivors and the reason he 's looking in books and ruins is owed to some subconcious understanding of his condition .

1 I watch that movie at least once a year . It does n't get old . That watch scene with Christopher Walken remains my favorite .

1 The snow effects were amazing too . They did a great job .

1 Im sorry to say , but this has been brought up so many times already that it is no longer funny . But hey , good effort : )

1 I feel like my expectations are too high now .

1 Cool beans .

1 Ouch , a few people I know actually LOVED that movie , one of them saying it was his favourite . Sigh .

1 10 / 10 would kneel

1 probably not . i thought this was smarter and definitely more self aware than the hangover , which could lead to a good sequel ... hopefully

1 I did n't click a single link . Did n't need to . Those sound bites are etched into my brain .

1 If a director you like steals , it 's called reference and homage . If a director you hate does it , it is labeled theft and plagiarism . Context is everything , right ?

1 I heard everything is super secret and hush hush on set . A friend of mine worked on the movie when it was filming in New York and she had to sign a * TON of non-disclosure agreements * . But , she said it was super fun and everyone was real cool . Even Jamie Foxx . * EDIT : I just asked her how she found out about the casting call for The Amazing Spiderman and she sent me this [ link ! ] ( http : / www.projectcasting.com / casting-calls-and-auditions / the-amazing-spider-man-2-casting-call-for-experienced-female / ) *

1 I do n't always find them pleasant either , but I * loved * [ this ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=KmkVWuP_sO0 ) .

1 Really ? You know the appropriate number of times to discuss a topic in film ? What 's the count on holocaust films ? How about broader topics , like poverty and war ? Please , now that we know there is a definitive number of times a subject can be breached on celluloid we need to know before we just . go . too . far .

1 I 'd go for Guardians .

1 We have to go deeper

1 LA Confidential

1 > Because every human being has a romantic subplot in his or her life . Sex and love are involved in everything . Psssh . I wish .

1 `` I 'm not a bigot , I hate everybody ''

1 The first one is worth watching ( pirated ) if only for the sinking ice . That 's about the only vivid memory I have of that movie . So glad I saw it in Mexico and paid like $ 2 .

1 * too soon *

1 Great choice . Tough , thick headed but the man can show heart too .

1 You all got it wrong . The filmmakers not trying to glorify the killers . In Indonesia nobody talks about the massacre , certainly not the killers . By making a documentary of the killers making a film of their exploits , the filmmakers are showing this forgotten history .

1 Alternatively , one can watch * Pygmalion * , which is the non musical version .

1 Thank you detective

1 totally agree the cgi is in need of an update and would make a great rerelease like that update test footage of Battlestar Galactica that was floating around .

1 There 's no such thing as `` Dragon-sickness '' in the book .

1 Because Tom Cruise was THE MOVIE ICON of the 80 's and 90 's . What do you think of when you hear `` 80 's sunglasses ? '' Wayfarers = Risky Business , Aviators = Top Gun . > Was it his choice of films ? Bingo . He was in a lot of major blockbusters that dominated the pop culture landscape . Top Gun , Oscar best film Rain Man , A Few Good Men , Mission Impossible , even his crappy movies like Cocktail and Days of Thunder were all over the place . But I think it was Jerry Maguire that solidified his super star status . You literally could n't have a conversation in 1996 without saying either SHOW ME THE MONEY or You had me at hello .

1 Because he was n't expendable ... * starts crying again *

1 thats the only part that sucks You can wear 3d glass 's wit hthem ! theres no place for them to sit on you or the glassed they need a little hook on them to hold it away from the glass part - and then i would use em all the time !

1 I was going to say Dr. Strangelove but ca n't it be argued that the `` second title '' is really just the title ? The second title is part of the overarching theme of the movie and should just be viewed as THE title .

1 Nothing against Selma , but there 's zero chance of that happening .

1 Same here . Usually in gone wild curvy .

1 As a pale dude who 's been in several stage performances , left side is sadly accurate

1 > I did n't see a single movie in theater this year . Well we are only 5 days into it , you 've still got time .

1 Hold my ballpoint pen , I 'm going in .

1 Yeah , cause I remember the narrator ( ed norton ) saying something along the lines of : `` If you know how , then I know how . ''

1 Shane Black ... Hackneyed , are you mad ? . You 're talking about the writer of the Lethal Weapon movies and the director of , the amazing , Kiss Kiss Bang Bang . I guess it 's just your opinion , but you really might want to consider revising that statement .

1 Also scary that getting tortured to death in the most horrible way possible was actually pretty historically common on every continent .

1 Fuck yeah * The Rock * . Nicolas Cage , Sean Connery and Ed Harris , all in one movie ? The fact that its directed by Michael Bay and has more unnecessary explosions than the Transformers just adds to its epicness .

1 Cube is freakin ' awesome . Not in an ironic way , not in a `` so bad it 's good '' way - just awesome .

1 OHH never a bad time to rewatch .

1 Woody Allen is one of the best American directors ever . He 's been making a film a year since the late 70 's and just about all of them are really good while others ( Annie Hall , Manhattan , Crimes & Misdemeanors ) are truly classic movies . He 's one of the rare , gifted comedians , not unlike George Carlin , who 's comedy got you thinking and laughing in equal measure .

1 No .

1 Maybe get back to the character 's original iteration would have worked a lot better . The Lone Ranger is the only survivor of an ambush . His Ranger Posse was murdered in a box canyon by the Cavendish Gang . Tonto came along to bury the dead and he discovered Ranger Reid survived . Tonto nursed him back to health , fashioned a mask for him , and helped the Ranger get revenge for his dead family . He uses Silver Bullets as a reminder to kill only when necessary . As silver is precious , so is life . Yes , this origin is very comic book , but so damn simple that only an idiot could screw it up .

1 It 's just white background left from shrinking the proportions of the second image .

1 that 's just like your opinion , man

1 I was so sad when Dr. Grant did n't actually spill that fucking kid 's intestines right there .

1 movie looks fun as hell

1 > And then got knocked the fuck out He did n't get ktfo . 5 round decision

1 I actually enjoyed * Sucker Punch * . I may as well add * The Spirit * into this category , too .

1 [ Video Link ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ewUPni-NeRQ )

1 Agreed . Even with the fifth chapter being thrown out and completely re-conceived , I do n't see this being very good .

1 God I would kill to see this on the big screen .

1 That battle really showed how overwhelmed the jedi were and the need for the clones .

1 Gilgamesh . A king . At Uruk .

1 They would n't have this amount of hype around them though .

1 But he knows Bruce Wayne , who was in the LoS .

1 That was decades and decades ago . Birth of a Nation is n't starting any arguments these days either .

1 > For the purpose of being able to relive the excitement of watching the movie the first time .

1 Im not trying to disrespect but sometimes I feel the Session 9 circlejerk on reddit is just an elaborate troll . I watched it and it looked and felt like a made-for-tv movie from the 90s. There were more parts that made me laugh at how silly it was than parts that scared me . I just dont get it . Is it just an elaborate ruse ?

1 Ray-hee-aaaain . FTFY

1 If by on point you mean 'a simple summary of the plot ' .

1 House of 1,000 Corpses while not being scary to me per se , it * does * always leave me feeling skeeved out . I just do n't know if I enjoy it or not , although kudos to Zombie for being able to elicit that feeling pretty strongly from me .

1 [ Word ! ] ( http : / defiant-ant.deviantart.com / art / Batman-Word-155697073 )

1 Americans do n't understand this as most movies are made in their back yard

1 You hit the nail on the head for me . The manipulative nature of the movie as well as just how DUMB the main character acts just made me not interested / connected to the characters . People always say `` oh that 's just the movie saying how war makes you do stupid things '' but the character is just too stubborn to go buy food or anything ... Harrowing movie but I was n't emotionally attached to the characters and DIdnt cry or anything .

1 I do n't know . It just had so much to say about people . About society . I just really liked it .

1 Lars Von trier

1 yeah I saw newt and instantly got sad = [

1 OHMSS is such an underrated bond movie . savalas did a great job making blofeld more of a physical threat to bond as well as a plotting nemesis type villain .

1 > He wanted to go back . Every time . The audience is in no way expected to take his wife 's side and say , `` Yeah man , put it to rest . Stay home and forget about your comrades . Yeah , that was chris Kyle 's choice IRL too . The movie did n't invent that . I think plenty of people sympathized with his wife . I did . > there are no positive portrayals of Arab characters ; the tone is strictly `` us vs them '' ) , How about the translators that help the troops ? I do n't understand what more people wanted . It 's literally based on Chris Kyle , an extreme `` patriot '' who killed 100+ jihadists . The patriotism could 've been turned to 11 , but they didnt , thankfully .

1 I 've watched every korean film on netflix and now do n't know what to do when I come home drunk on weekends

1 Watch now , buy Blu ray once it 's out .

1 Those are n't Kevin Smith movies . DUH !

1 Exactly

1 James Earl Jones delivering a powerful message to Simba as the ghost of Mufasa . This is my favorite scene from the Lion King . Not only is it visually beautiful , but the message is powerful , and the music is equally as epic and amazing . Also , a very sad , but uplifting scene .

1 I do n't HATE the Oscars . Hell I watch 'em every year . But I do n't pretend just because an actor or film wins or is even nominated means jack shit . I mean . Julia Roberts for Pretty Woman ? ! ? Come the fuck on !

1 I like to think of it as the director trying something different . Where in raid 1 it was very simple . One building and just a bunch of action kind of like die hard . Which I really loved that idea of one way in no way out but by going through all the henchmen . Here there is a much more complex story which I think is fine considering that the director did n't try to make the film too deep or stray too far from the action film it was supposed to be . Also I read on wikiledia that origionally the director was going to make a movie like the second one but did n't have enough budget . Interesting to think that had he aquired money he may not have made the same indie hit that he had accomplished in the raid 1 .

1 * The movie got called on account of 9 / 11 . * A lot of the original version was about an alien terrorist attack on New York City . That plotline had to be scrapped and written around because of 9 / 11 . This includes a space ship vs flying car battle between the Twin Towers .

1 Based on [ this redditor 's post ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / comments / ckezx / so_i_just_got_back_from_the_last_airbenderit_is / ) , it seems that the 3D just makes it worse .

1 > I still really just do n't understand how fellow Americans can sit on their ass and condemn him for putting his life on the line to save American lives . Not praising someone as a hero is not the same as condemning him .

1 True , but the bird did n't speak . A bird returning is a simpler message than , `` Hey , Smaug is missing a scale under its left wing . ''

1 Seriously . I keep thinking of this as being out next summer instead of almost * two years * from now .

1 This documentary amazed and scared me . Highly recommend this .

1 il belive it when theres actual news of it . right now `` indusrty insiders '' dosnt mean shit .

1 I was going to say Die Hard ( 1 ) . There 's a Christmas party and everything ! And they even come to learn the importance of family .

1 Never in my life have I heard `` yabos '' used except in this movie . Also , that little girl was such a cock block .

1 more like how did the `` Lucy '' thread ever get to the front . this is just mockery , seeing as how many couch scientists fucking flew out of the woodwork to tell us all how * scientifically inaccurate this hollywood blockbuster is * . Can you even * believe * how much better than everyone else they are for knowing that ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? like WOW

1 Little Nicky is gold .

1 Sadly , all of those actors and horses are about to get blown to bits anyways

1 Perfectly said . The fact that several of the great medium budget films this year came from one billionaire heiress ( Megan Ellison ) is very depressing . Also now that TV is spending $ 40-60 million a season we are going to see more and more cases of great directors and actors moving to television .

1 It 's a great movie , but how is 93 % on Rotten Tomatoes , 16th best movie of the decade on IMDB , and an Academy Award `` underappreciated '' ?

1 One of my friends called Grave of the Fireflies `` the best movie I never want to watch again '' .

1 `` You are the Michael Jordan of being a son of a bitch . ''

1 I like to think of the book as two separate stories . The first is about the descent into madness and depravity that Patrick Bateman goes through as he kills , rapes , and tortures , while the second is one big advertisement for household items , Phil Collins and Genesis , and Whitney Houston . The violent parts I got through no sweat , it was reading page after page of Phil Collins ' career that slowed me down .

1 Two hands , better accuracy . An extra upvote for the trouser flare .

1 They were n't selling that missile to them . Logically , if you are selling weapons to what is essentially the enemy , you never sell them the top notch stuff so you still have the advantage .

1 They 've been working for Sony for a while through Sony Television 's Community .

1 The one good thing came out of that ... thing , was that the fans did n't go 'RUINED ! WHOLE FRANCHISE IS RUINED ! ' They did nothing . They continued loving the original source material and basically ignored the Abomination . Which Is What Everyone Should Do with a shitty adaptation . Just ignore it .

1 Saving this for future use

1 We 're up all night to get Dick Jones .

1 It is indeed a shamble of sap .

1 The only CGI is the screen instructions . Blade Runner has more visually breathtaking frames over Interstellar .

1 Yep , basically the poster with music behind it .

1 > Rotten tomatoes , Metacritic , why such low scores ? THAT is not valid . Are you saying the people who did n't like the film should lie and say they liked it , to make you happy ? Some people did n't like the film . Some people do n't like Citizen Kane , or Lawrence of Arabia , or Tokyo Story . It 's common . Move on .

1 The soundtrack is awesome .

1 I never understood this . Oh , it 's that guy . Oh yeah , and Keanu Reeves .

1 Can confirm , TARS was my main issue too for the IMAX . McCounaghey a bit maybe , but that 's his Texas accent fault rather than the mixing .

1 Gum Carl !

1 Your nostalgia is showing .

1 I know . I 'm just being a dick .

1 Do n't you * ever * try to tell me how to live my life again .

1 The whole movie is epic . Spin the ideology around , and you have the history of the Fox News Channel . The business model is identical . This is one of the greatest American films of all time . It 's seen as a classic , but it needs to be seen as a revelation .

1 Fuck you , he had brain cancer ... and come on 13 going on 30 , golden ... kinda

1 Either that or The Wind Rises .

1 \ # rekt

1 Also , Brooks ' letter from the outside always gives me chills .

1 Apologies , but what are you referring to ?

1 Um . I really feel bad for this up vote .

1 Barely learned that ? Have you seen the Machete movies ? It 's pretty much just a documentary of Danny Trejo 's life .

1 To play a little devils advocate . 1 ) I do n't think you were supposed to like the judges , they are the law and in this new world order they have set up the law is harsh especially when Dredd is serving it up . 2 ) Cheesy dialogue is hit or miss personally I loved it . `` Its justice time '' 3 ) I personally did not see the whole Dredd is a superhero thing . 4 ) I do not recall any mention of an apocalypse but yeah I really liked the scenes where they showed the city and wished did more with it but whatever . 5 ) If I recall correctly they used defcon testing as an excuse to lower the buildings `` firewall '' ( if you will ) and install their super hax which in turn let nerd guy control the building . 6 ) Its an action movie , I do n't think there has been one without the main character killing someone since the 80 's . ( citation needed ) and the main characters are cops , so there you go . Plus they shot at the cops with a chain gun , come on if that 's not justified lethal force then idk what is .

1 I swear that I have joked in the past about retrofitting theaters as gas chambers and using bad movies as a means of selective population reduction . Do you have a freckle on your left forearm ?

1 It 's honestly not horrible . It 's worth a redbox rental .

1 You 're like the drunk step dad who comes home and whips your step son with a belt because he left the oven on . Then the next morning you realized what you did and apologized ... it 's ok I forgive you .

1 > What up mane ? [ Das it , mane . ] ( http : / mlkshk.com /r/K9YB )

1 Oh I do . It makes me feel better about my own instability .

1 Oh for fucks sake . Really ?

1 And it also was n't a government vs aliens type movie . The family was vulnerable and helpless in their farm and could n't rely on anyone for help . It made you feel boarded in with them .

1 Summary : Great mind , not great author .

1 PTA

1 `` You Trusted Me and I failed you '' I remember tearing up in the packed theater at the midnight showing . Michael Caine definitely knows how to get a reaction .

1 Imagine getting sent to the front of the movie screen to get paddled in a line , then you sit down and hit in the head with rice and toast .

1 and worked for blomkamp ... i like this guy already .

1 I was out of town on business and one of my business cohorts had me over to his house and was like `` you have to see this move Battlefield Earth '' I had to sit there for the whole movie , drink beer and just take it . It was worse than being gang raped by gorillas .

1 Until you destroy the Rift which incidentally causes a drought .

1 Whatever , he 's Stan Lee !

1 You 're just suffering from armchair social psychology burn out

1 > and adult Turk , a female , has no babies Turk takes after Rosie O'Donnell in certain aspects .

1 I thought it was fantastic . Sure wish I had been told I was supposed to hate it before now . Now I have to go rewatch it with a different mindset . # justhivemindthings

1 One of the only adaptations with a major change from the original that the author fully approves . > Frank wrote a new ending that I loved . It is the most shocking ending ever and there should be a law passed stating that anybody who reveals the last 5 minutes of this film should be hung from their neck until dead . - Stephen King

1 `` Not just any toon ! '' My thing was up until after the steamroller , as far as you knew judge doom is still just some asshole human . To see the entire process a live person slowly and graphically flattened was terrifying , borderline gore . And then for him to get up , inflate himself and do the whole `` REMEMBER ME EDDIE ! ? '' bit . Of course the toon death with the shoe in the dip was just as scary too . Defnitely my favorite and most watched movie as a kid , along with Clash of the Titans .

1 Just a note . You can click 'hide ' without voting .

1 A lot of pain and suffering . Did n't seem so cool to me .

1 I lead a pretty happy life despite 3rd . I think I 'd be happier on 1st but I 'm making it work .

1 I hate the penguin , I understand your point but he 's such a smug little bitch . Breaking his hand in arkham city felt soo fucking good .

1 That 's not true , at least not to my knowledge .

1 Not that I did n't enjoy part I , it was great with many memorable moments and quotes but I really liked how the scope was broader in part II . Vito Corleone 's rise to fame and Michael 's transformation from a family man to a cold blooded , corrupt . I enjoyed both parts . Only , Part II a teensy bit more . : )

1 The last one is my favorite on this thread .

1 The fact he looks like a textbook steroid user ? The odds of someone being that big and that ripped , and then packing on 40+ pounds of solid muscle on top of that naturally are near nonexistent . The guy is 260+ pounds of solid muscle as a middle aged man . No way thats all just diet and exercise . Edit : The guy does work out crazy hard and his diet is legendary , but you dont get gains like that without some help .

1 As long as he makes Hellboy before anything .

1 Well , people are complaining that Channing Tatum has too large of a build to * look * like Gambit . Even now , people still complain that Hugh Jackman is over a foot taller than Wolverine is supposed to be , as well . He actually went to a Comic Con , in the full movie costume , to just blend into the crowd and see if anyone would notice him . He said that no one knew who he was , and that several people told him `` Nice costume , but you 're too tall ! `` .

1 The guy only released about one movie half a decade then decade towards the end and judging by the documentary * Stanley Kubrick 's Boxes * he was obsessively planning them the whole time . A flawless genius . Maybe even the greatest filmmaker of all time .

1 I heard it was because he had gas and nearly died .

1 When you were a child , the internet was not around to give you any other reason to see it .

1 also [ Tom Waits ] ( http : / 3.bp.blogspot.com / _p4PkoeXYyOQ / SYhqp5Mlw2I / AAAAAAAABUc / uGiIqLfQc_4 / s400 / tom.jpg ) .

1 Shhhh ... just go with it . Reality is so boring .

1 Every workplace back then was a toxic hellhole .

1 Have you read The Infinity Gauntlet ? Nebula plays a huge part in it , and I would love to see what happens in the comic to happen in the movie .

1 Your logic is not wanted here .

1 > Why is this movie called Mad Max ? He 's not the hero , Imperator Furiosa is . Max has always been an anti-hero protagonist helping a group of better people survive . He sacrifices himself to protect The refinery tribe , the Tribal Children , and now the mothers and then he drifts off back into the wastes . > Tom Hardy needs a new character other than Bane when he 's playing the role of a lunatic . He was actually doing a spot on Mad Max ? la Mel Gibson . That 's the nature of the character . > she THROWS her gun at him . Like , what the fuck ? Just shoot him . A lot of the mothers were using black-powder weapons . I ca n't remember but had n't she shot someone with it already ?

1 oh god when Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis morphed their faces into monsters like [ this ] ( http : / imgur.com / BCwLicX ) nope

1 I think after their initial lukewarm review they were bombarded with so many tweets , emails and comments of angry fans trying to make `` an objective argument '' about how great Boyhood is and they just do n't know shit , that this is became a very appropriate response .

1 A : R had a lot of good to it , and some pretty signifigant bad . I love the different characters of the mercenary crew . ( i would watch a series of movies about their adventures before this movies timeline ) The Dr 's were pretty good representation of what happens when science goes too far . The General was a bit of a badass ( that masterful grenade toss ) . The big problem was [ the new hideous alien creature and how they used that character and Ripley 's ridiculous merging with the mother bit . ] ( / spoiler )

1 [ It amazes me how little you know yourself ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / JlnOl.jpg ) .

1 Thank you for acknowledging your hipsterdom .

1 Sometimes I think it 'd be harder to do two similar voices and keep them completely separate and not screw up .

1 I worked at a Blockbuster in a small southern town when this movie came out . They really did n't get it , at all . So much so that my manager offered refunds for the movie , no questions asked . Really depressing .

1 My memory of that storyline 's a bit fuzzy . But if I recall , that was part of the plan . He thought he 'd been fully vampire 'd , but cyclops was just waiting to essentially jumpstart his healing factor once he 'd tracked down Jubilee . Basically Wolverine was used as a trojan horse . Later on she was able to stay somewhat functional because he gave her continual blood donations that were able to keep her mostly human in mind if not in form . Though decades back there was a really fun What IF comic called [ What if Wolverine Was Lord of the Vampires ] ( http : / marvel.wikia.com / What_If % 3F_Vol_2_24 ) . Then [ the sequel ] ( http : / marvel.wikia.com / What_If % 3F_Vol_2_37 ) asked the totally logical followup question of what would happen if a demonic invasion happened while he was ruling the mutant vampires .

1 I 'd go so far as to say the only good one . From what I 've seen . All the rest just get kidnapped , or pine , or generally have some dude do for them instead of acting as a real protagonist .

1 I do n't think the industry makes a difference . I 'm an attorney and we get all sorts of short hand and hostile emails sent from mobile between firms and within our own firm all the time . Emails like `` K. well what time is best for u then '' or `` lol no that 's not going to work '' are n't uncommon .

1 I loved End of Watch . Stoked to see what David Ayers does with this . Should be an interesting final product .

1 Tyler Perry does not make funnier or more relevant movies than Adam Sandler

1 My point is that focusing on it as a musical does n't make much sense from a marketing perspective . They 've already got the musical people from the name Sondheim . What they 're targeting here is piquing the interest of the general populace with big names and well known fairy tales .

1 Hope you like it ! My roommates could n't watch more than 5 minutes of it ... : ( To me the steadicam movement and dreamy wandering felt like I had dipped my brain into a vat of icy-hot - I loved it !

1 Steve Buscemi is in it somewhere ...

1 ... and he 's also paralysed ?

1 Damn , not even the correct quote from Family Guy . Yeesh .

1 Most people are indeed idiots . You make it seem like that is very hard to believe or something . For example , your superiority complex is predicated upon ridiculous notions and you even have the audacity to make sweeping claims about the racial demographics of your form of employment . A mature and well-adjusted adult would acknowledge that not all people are the same and that perhaps there are other reasons behind why certain people choose certain professions instead of bringing up IQ ( which is absolute bullshit either way ) . But an idiot would do the exact opposite and ignore the mountains of evidence against their opinion in favor anecdotal horseshit . TL ; DR You 're an idiot and I seriously hope you 're 100 % fine with raising dysfunctional children .

1 I expected Jupiter to be bad , and it was n't . There 's some good concepts in there and a good framework for a mythology . Bad casting and some unfortunate dialogue doomed it . Great SFX

1 No she did n't . What she suffered from was clinical depression . Read up on what Arthur Miller had to say about her .

1 You should probably spoiler tag that as it 's still in cinemas .

1 The original is a fantastic film that started with a fantastic script . It 's incredibly well-crafted on more levels than you might realize . Here 's an example : Holly 's Rolex watch , which is introduced early in the film as a corporate bonus for all her hard work , represents her career ( or more specifically , McClane 's handling of it ) as the main obstacle in John and Holly 's relationship . At the climax of the film , Gruber is hanging out the window and clutching onto Holly 's wrist , threatening to take her with him as McClane tries to save her . The way they break Gruber 's grip on her is by unlatching her watchband , so both Gruber and the watch fall . It resolves 3 story arcs in one : Gruber is defeated , Holly is saved , and John and Holly 's relationship is saved . That 's really , really good screenwriting .

1 Same difference .

1 1 ) SEE ? That sign would have been perfect ! 2 ) I ca n't stop thinking that sign * really * needs some punctuation after `` Do not enter '' , else the meaning becomes unclear and all more disturbing .

1 It would actually be great if he made a film loosely based on the Zodiac killer like Dirty Harry , except the killer is targeting gay couples . 1970s San Francisco actually seems like a great setting for a Tarantino movie , and he could use as many 70s movie references as he likes .

1 Which ones ? I 've always felt like Fear and Loathing was his best role . Followed by Ed Wood Although he was good in What 's Eating Gilbert Grape

1 Mad Dog !

1 So ... it is n't timeless then , is it ?

1 Do yourself a favour , go through the list and pick 20 films that grab your attention ( more than others ) ... then find a way to watch those films . I 've seen quite a few on the list and it 's always great fun ( to me ) to find movies I have n't heard of / seen and watch them . I 've got about 10-15 films from this list I plan to watch . Also read through the comments in this thread , there 's some amazing films being mentioned that were n't on the list . Blade Runner is an obvious one ( a few people have mentioned it ) . Happy watching !

1 I DOUBLE DARE YOU , MOTHER FUDGER .

1 PREACH . I know I 'm going to be rewatching Birdman every year for a celebration of good cinema . That was just breath-taking , and I wish it came to my country so I could 've watched it in the theaters . The Oscars have always had a hard on for biopics of real people , but Birdman was too clear a Best Picture winner to risk putting anything above it , so they probably compromised with their yearly agenda by having a biopic for Best Actor .

1 It was n't even just Wrath of Khan again ; it was a bunch of concepts and lines from Wrath of Khan slighlty-reworked . Or 'reversed ' . And then thrown back at the audience . And then they crashed a starship into San Francisco and Spock punched the bad guy . What do you mean that does n't sound like Star Trek ? ( Yes , just in case it is n't clear , I 'm being abundantly sarcastic . )

1 Actually that 'd be Insomnia or Following

1 Gulliver 's Travels had lots of horses .

1 > Honestly though , I think in general seeing a film in a theater , preferably with a large audience , still to this day is the optimal way to see most any film . You must n't hate people as much as the rest of us .

1 DOFP was a failure ?

1 Superman once wore armor literally made of plot , though , so ...

1 ( Spoils ) Nice to know she haunts others too . I think the whole movie was horrible because of her , because of stupid disbelief ( `` Nah , there 's no monsters '' -splat- ARE YOU FUCKING MORONS ? ) and especially the ending . Still makes my blood boil . Still offered quite successful feel of fulfillness : [ only video I found about it ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=cnAbKaZqRLA )

1 The Man with No Name trilogy . Sergio Leone was an amazing director and the use of such a subtle and simple score accents the trilogy perfectly .

1 AKA The Rock and The Rock 2 .

1 btw Irex sounds stupid . Like Apple paid em or something . Or an angry Jamaican destroying a city .

1 The Talented Mr. Ripley ...

1 I 've never been able to figure out how that movie is n't beloved by everyone . It 's so good .

1 I liked their choices because it 's a deliberate setup for the sinister six . You could n't avoid having the goblin in the movie if your next move is the S6 . He needs a proper intro . The Rhino is the correct throwaway . He 's even the general punching bag in the comics in the same fashion . I do n't think they could have handled this mix any better .

1 He was the only reason I managed to sit through the entirety of Drive Angry . Goddamn did he kick ass in that movie .

1 No , but Comic Con would .

1 the studios did something stupid again , so he stayed out until they pleased him

1 It looked more like red and neon glows

1 Well , if she was bald and lost her mustache , that would be pretty noteworthy

1 I have a feeling kryptonite will be established this movie . Whenever Supes goes up against somebody nowhere near his power level magic or kryptonite usually makes an appearance .

1 Bioshock

1 Movies from my childhood

1 And it was Cameron 's day off too !

1 very possible , but it looks pretty dumb already

1 Yeah , they mention in multiple articles / interviews that when Whedon agreed with an actor wanting a line jiggling he 'd just whip out like a couple of pages and see what worked .

1 I have a fantasy where they take the treatment from that youtube video `` What if Star Wars Episode I was Good '' and actually remake the prequels using CG to retain ( most of the ) the original cast .

1 The greater good .

1 In One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest some of the orderlies play basketball with / against the mental patients .

1 No , not even close .

1 Motherfucking Judo is a splinter martial arts discipline . While it is influenced by Judo , it has its roots in street fighting , pimp discipline and just looking like a bad ass . Practitioners include Shaft , Billy Thunder , that dude in 10th grade that beat your ass and Samuel Clemens .

1 Probably an instructional video on how to build larger storage devices .

1 Plot twist : Bruce Willis is the room .

1 its great , one of the best coming of age movies of the last few years

1 `` Paging Mr. Herman , Mr. Herman you have a telephone call at the front desk . ''

1 ... and I want to play Jackie Chan ... ... life 's not fair .

1 No . No one else has seen it .

1 Though it would n't if that one gender was male .

1 hes deleting his post to less popular subs about the girls he forgot to pick up weeks ago ; p

1 Optimus Prime did not die for that .

1 dunno why i thought id get a well formulated response , it is /r/movies afterall

1 Have you seen the Original version ? It 's a little better

1 Regardless Bourne was n't acting under the effects of the meds . Greens were n't made viral until six months before the events of Legacy which runs parallel to Ultimatum . 2 years pass between the events of Identity and Supremacy . ANd not to mention that the first time Blues were made viral occurred in Legacy . Jason Bourne was not acting under the effects of medication .

1 Frankly I was convinced Mark Hamill was from Tattooine .

1 Some parts of New Zealand are more British than Britain . There are some real anglophiles there ... .

1 What about jumping out of a plane with a * inflatable fucking raft *

1 Well I can understand if someone would n't like it but man I love that movie .

1 ... lost the SAG to Johnny Depp

1 I feel you there . Once I was watching a Lynch movie with a friend and his brother , and the brother would not stop asking questions - and the questions were n't even interesting . `` Who is she ? Is she a bad guy ? Where is she going ? '' SHUT THE HELL UP AND WATCH THE MOVIE , YOU MIGHT FIND OUT .

1 I too watched the first 2 minutes .

1 Nice . But if you 're in the right mood and have a big screen , Lawrence of Arabia is magic .

1 And the worst blow jobs .

1 Which means that he waxed off his body hair , coated himself in cocoa butter , and paraded around on a stage in a G-string flexing his muscles for a room full of men .

1 I was going to say this , it could almost be a documentary .

1 [ Ah , but she is ! Just like Brunce Wayne is Batman 's mask ] ( / spoiler )

1 Exactly . That a specific movie does n't pass the Bechdel test is not a problem and does not take away from the movie or the artistic integrity of anyone involved . Maybe it 's a movie about two gay cowboys . That 90 % of all movies as a whole do n't pass the test ? That 's a legitimate problem .

1 Do n't diss the work of Ray Harryhausen !

1 Benjamin Button puts me right to sleep

1 its an awesome one though

1 Damn , now I want a modern Superman that is bright and confident and uses colour to highlight Supes ' godhood . Something that could have been contrasted in the next film as Batman darkens everything ...

1 But that movie was n't based on a hugely successful , poorly written book .

1 I believe you 're thinking of Sean Bean .

1 No ticket .

1 I thought it sounded like a Simpsons we-don't-want-to-pay-for-rights Black Hawk Down parody .

1 V = versus

1 Is n't it 60 % ?

1 It 's a fantastic movie , though something about Peevey 's performance always throws me off .

1 Would n't want to use the internet wrong !

1 Ah-hah-hah-hah ! What a story , Mark !

1 Larry : Hellooo Curly : Hellooo Moe : Hellooo

1 That 's not always a good metric to use , though . There is so much going on behind the scenes at a studio that can effect the final script , it 's unfair to pin it wholly on the guy who wrote it . Case in point : [ the guy ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0326040 / ? ref_=fn_al_nm_2 # writer ) who wrote A Beautiful Mind also wrote Batman & Robin .

1 > Leto is a good enough actor to make it his own as long as EVERYONE ( including writers , directors , the other suits ) involved in his performance focuses on that , then we should be fine .

1 It gets even more confusing when your boss pays you strictly in M & Ms .

1 foreign bootleg subtitled vers ?

1 i dunno if i would say Krull was a star wars rip-off ... .at all . It was a fantasy rip-off if anything . Also , it was a great movie , B-movie sure , but still a fun watch .

1 I think you 're right . but rathergood died a little later like 03-04

1 Well , they 're hesitant to properly say they 're truly shutting down . They need of a bit of reshuffling before they can start again . And Miyazaki 's always a gloomy gus . A couple of the producers say that there 's always potential for work in the future and Miyazaki 's interested in handling some short films in the meantime . And I have faith in the new directors . They 've showed their potential before and I 'd like them to explore it more in the future . The slowing down has more to do with money that it has with the studio 's reputation .

1 Yes , pirating their movies will make them stop complaining , good thinking .

1 Came here to recommend World 's Greatest Dad

1 Or even Pacific Rim . Which had better story and fight scenes than any Bay Transformers movie .

1 [ Son of a bitch ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=_9MqbIyr2a8 )

Macy losing Best Supporting Actor to Cuba Gooding Jr . in 1996 * Pulp Fiction * and * Shawshank Redemption * losing Best Picture to * Forrest Gump * * Traffic * losing Best Picture to * Gladiator *

1 A Dame to Kill For ? It 's between TMNT and Dracula Untold , below the halfway point . : ) Edit : Apparently two lists are loading for people due to some weird redirect . Weird .

1 Just watched The Guest a couple of weeks ago . Loved it , but above all , I fell in love with the soundtrack .

1 Ehhhhh ... The performances were nothing special to me . I mean Cooper did a fine job of portraying your typical Texas cowboy soldier but is that really noteworthy ? The whole brother aspect was complete garbage and mostly ignored when it should 've been integral to the story . The wife was probably the best acting and even then , it was n't award-winning . Or how about the dumb Marine who was watching his back for the first tour ? Poorly written comedic relief that then tries to play itself off as theme when he says he likes his job on the roof . How cliche.. If it had only tried to be an entertaining war flick , I would have no problem with it but instead , it tried to mask shallow patriotic heartgrabbing underneath overly done yet poorly conceived plot points . It half-assed the family and brotherhood aspects in favor of going overboard with the action . Meh .

1 Although , in her defense , Catherine Hardwicke also directed Thirteen and Lords of Dogtown . Both quality films . And with Twilight she was hampered with a shit story and wooden actors , and there was a reason ( apparently ) she did n't come back for the sequels . But yeah , this one does seem marketed towards that crowd .

1 Interesting List and i can totally support 2001 , Avatar and Star Wars . But why is there no `` Lord of the Rings '' but `` Gone with the Wind '' ? WTF

1 I actually love Pirates of the Caribbean 3 .

1 Thanks Captain Bringdown

1 Sho Nuff !

1 Missed it by THIS much ... http : / kotaku.com / power-rangers-get-a-mighty-gritty-reboot-1687684752

1 do n't you know teenagers do everything * ironically * ?

1 The bad movies he was in were not bad because of him .

1 The action was the best part . Nolan 's Batman had terrible action . Sneyder 's Superman actually fought like Superman .

1 So sad .

1 I assume they were made by the same studio ?

1 Yea , I actually want to see this.. I think it will be worth a good laugh .

1 I was wondering who the other guy was on the other bills . The director 's dad . Haha .

1 Close , but AB positive is universal recipient . If someone has type O then they can not receive the A or B alleles , however someone with type AB can receive blood with either or neither of the A and B alleles .

1 Walk the thin red line

1 If you 're looking for karma , I 've got some for you .

1 The fan unextended edit . Ca n't wait .

1 He is sucking you into the same trap ! He is covering for his poor writing skills by saying it was all done by voice recognition .

1 dong lover is awesome . Also , when that kid spit the milk out , I lost it .

1 Forget C3PO . R2D2 is a sith lord in disguise .

1 This is a pretty definitive cross section of the series with all Bonds but Daniel Craig represented . With that in mind , I 'd sub out 'You Only Live Twice ' or 'For Your Eyes Only ' for 'Casino Royale ' .

1 Damnit ! that was going to be mine - I love Angel Heart !

1 It 's really , really not .

1 So of course we listened to this speech before a few football games in high school . Fun story is we lost every single time we did it . My senior year I told them about it and they played it anyways . Still lost . Do n't know if it was coincidence or superstition but I will still change the channel if I see it on tv during the fall .

1 Did we see the same movie ?

1 I was thinking just this the entire video . The lip smacking was hilariously well done .

1 ooooooooooooooo

1 Absolutely..no one can judge any of this , they do n't know what he was going through , and from my experience , having friends who have committed suicide , it 's not so much as a cry for help as it is a desperate attempt to free yourself of the pain you 're experiencing . Poor guy , truly a tragedy .

1 Coming out May 11th . IMDB has that one wrong .

1 Downvotes for you . If you like the soundtrack , which I did as well , you should be trying to get people to support the musician , not sharing a download .

1 ... he wrote the story ...

1 try typing it in . It 's forbidden , as it should be .

1 Clones from Polynesians .

1 All of the Green Mile was about him peeing . And having trouble peeing . And then Michael Clarke Duncan grabs his dick .

1 > * I think this is where we shake hands . *

1 Yes . I was trying to give context to the movie , but there are some unique differences too . Such as : Dodgson and Nedry meet in San Francisco , not Costa Rica . Also , the meeting that takes place in the trailer between Grant , Ellie , and Hammond is done over the phone .

1 Your friend is right ! They re-open the curtain after a few minutes then they show it .

1 The Lost World : Jurassic Park was great .

1 You 're almost too brave .

1 The stadium shot . Fucking . Hell .

1 You 're splitting hairs .

1 nevermind . I just watched it for the first time in 21 years and it is n't as good as I thought it was . Damn you , nostalgia !

1 But he was 10 / 10 where it truly counts . In our hearts .

1 As a historian and hopefully soon history teacher ... Thank you for giving my brain some random enjoyment haha . I love thinking about historical what-if 's : ) They tell you a lot about how different people view the same historical event ... which to my sad nerdy brain is neat-o .

1 Me too , but he 's been really overdone lately , and I would n't be able to see Dream , I 'd see Sherlock / Khan .

1 I could be mistaken , but I think the way into limbo ( or purgatory ) WAS by falling asleep . That 's the way Mal and Cobb entered it when they created their own dream world ; it was by going deeper and deeper into their dream states that allowed them to tap into that subconscious , or limbo . I think the confusion with the anesthesia was that it was an unfortunate side effect . Dying while in the sleep state induced by the anesthesia just so happened to produce the same effect as going so deep in dream levels ( the way they reached Fischer in the end ) . At least that was my understanding . I kind of took it as a plot device to heighten the tension during their mission .

1 What was it supposed to be ?

1 Surrogates

1 You beat me by three minutes in posting this . Your punishment must be more severe .

1 Yeah I agree . The gore made it , not scary , but more intense .

1 I ca n't exactly explain to you how.. but I just seem to do a lot more thinking about my day ever since watching this three days ago . I had to stop half way through and take a break because how much it was impacting what I thought about myself.. What is it about this movie ...

1 Its really really well done . The ending is so good !

1 Calm down Michael Bay

1 I hope they go for something really bizarre and unconventional , not trying anything logical that makes sense . Part of the charm of the original was that it just had bizarre things with a `` deal with it '' attitude , not apologizing for them , like the sand worm from Saturn or why Beetlejuice was living in the miniature to begin with .

1 It is .

1 Somehow , unconciously , I read this in Bowie 's voice and to the music , the first time

1 Excatly this , i was like why is this korean drug lord doing in taiwan ? ? ? Also you cant just go to paris with like only 25 men and then go to public hospital and start shooting peoples . What the hell ?

1 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH

1 I never get tired of the Prestige .

1 Sadly missing from Alicia Silverstone 's costume..

1 I usually ca n't tell if people are looking at me when I have my eyes * closed * .

1 > Where the fuck have I been ? Apparently not the 1980s .

1 And censorship

1 Not all movies are about action and plot .

1 Ryan Gosling hunting down Gary Oldman in Vietnam ? Goddamn that would be amazing .

1 I can finally separate him from the Twilight saga because of his characterization in this film .

1 Do n't feel bad . This happens to most people at some point .

1 My favorite comment , I forget from whom , is that this is the first time someone who has played Sherlock Holmes has a more ridiculous name than Sherlock Holmes .

1 For Scifi , I 'd have to say hands down , Blade Runner

1 The imagery in that film so adult , especially with the plagues . When they do the plague of the spirit killing the children its so creepy ...

1 Coffee is the devil 's drink

1 Obvious that they would do this , and a smart move by Sony . It 's the movie industry after all . That said , I do n't see what the big deal is with the movie anyway , should have been released free to the internet or TV as a remembrance to that guy everyone hated but now pretend like they really liked him the whole time .

1 Yes very . Should be out in December .

1 i apologize for my mistake . i would change it if i could .

1 Yeah , that was pretty obvious toward the end . It bugs me , though , since it means that the [ only major character actually * was * taking Prozium in the movie was Preston himself in the early scenes . They should 've left at least one other character as a `` model Librian '' to contrast against Preston . ] ( / spoiler )

1 Do n't . It 's shit .

1 http : / i.imgur.com / xPoBNhS.gif

1 Dude 's charismatic as fuck and has n't been able to show off a more wild character . I 'd love for him to take up the challenge .

1 Or `` Deep Impact '' and `` Armageddon '' . I don ? t know why but it does happen way too often .

1 it would be rad if they could pull off clayface , cgi is probably up to the task these days . he has a really good storyline in batman the animated series ; dark & gritty , it could work well with * begins * & * dark knight * .

1 Well it 's the more country open areas . There are a lot less people and they are more spread out . If they live out there they probably do n't have great if any internet . Plus it ca n't really spread by word of mouth out there . Most of the dots you see in those areas are the big towns . The rest is just open land and farm areas with no internet . Not enough people out there to show up on the map .

1 Watch Toy Story 3 , then you shall understand .

1 Somebody knows his Nietzsche .

1 > even though you were probably just trying to be humorous . You remind me of my math teacher .

1 No you do n't , the only reason I know so much about this aspect is because I 've researched that specific question on different forums before . Thanks though !

1 Shit , judge you ? I was right there in the movie theatre bawling my eyes out . Still ca n't watch it without tearing up . Just thinking about Pikachu trying , over and over again again to wake him up , bring him back , that stubborness to refuse to let him die ... . excuse me

1 he has n't even begun to peak

1 You barely see his face in TDKR , he 's also barely recogniseable in that role when you can . Most people will probably never realise .

1 I think if it 's * really * funny it 's okay .

1 hotter .

1 You 're so right . Symbolism was made up by your teachers .

1 The Illusionist in 2006 , starring Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti

1 Than you would n't have a good movie and her parents would die .

1 A dovahkiin .

1 Do n't matter if you look away from Primer or not . You wo n't understand it either way

1 Bull Durham is a great movie .

1 meh .

1 Do n't forget it 's Oscar-nominated too .

1 I think this would really depend on your home setup . If you have a well sized , nice quality screen supported by a strong surround sound setup , I 'd probably be less-inclined to leave my couch . That being said , the cinema as a night-out experience is still something I look forward to weeks in advance .

1 Did n't he try out for it ?

1 I think I know what you 're referring to . They obviously want to make a sequel . They should have hinted at a resurrection of some kind , and left it at that . They needed a reason for * spoiler * to not kill * huge spoiler * though .

1 That would be pretty awesome , actually .

1 Each camera captures footage of the fight scene from different angles . This is helps in completing the fight in a single take .

1 Jeez all the roles I 've seen Bruce in you 'd think it was his only talent .

1 This one is not that oddly timed considering the movie comes out in about three weeks .

1 ca n't forget Y tu mama tambi ? n to start it all off

1 Excuse me , but that 's an inappropriate word to use . I am definitely a * selfish * cunt .

1 HOT FUZZ !

1 Yeah , but look at Jeff Bridges . He just keeps getting better and better .

1 I love `` Spirited Away '' . One of my favorite animated films . `` Crouching Tiger '' is in my to-do list so I might see that soon .

1 We wo n't get to say that many more times ... sad , sad times .

1 as a black guy I still use that line when I 'm in a place where I find out I 'm not the only black person

1 Regarding World War Z : I thought the virus and the infected acted like a hivemind with the sole purpose of spreading he virus . They are very efficient to the point of ignoring weakened humans who would not be able to spread the virus . It was a flaw in the behavior of the virus that gave humans the upper hand .

1 That 's about the price of one movie in NY .

1 > The industry has gone through box-office slumps before but always has recovered . Many are hopeful that 's what will happen by May , when Johnny Depp sails into theaters with the latest `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' movie . At CinemaCon , studios are seeking to excite theater owners with previews of some of their highly anticipated summer sequels , including `` Fast Five , '' `` The Hangover Part II '' and `` Cars 2 '' as well as fresh event films like the comic book adaptations `` Thor '' and `` Green Lantern . '' If lame sequels , Disney merchandising films , and more comic book movies are supposed to excite me into going into the theatre , I can see why they 're going through a slump .

1 Because future and past

1 > Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II 's sex scene aboard the Owl Ship is set to the tune of Leonard Cohen 's `` Hallelujah '' . Originally Zack Snyder used a recording of the song by Allison Crowe for the scene , but decided Crowe 's version was `` too romantic '' and `` too sexy '' for * a scene that is intended to come across as ironic and `` ridiculous '' * . Snyder ended up placing the original Cohen studio recording in this scene . http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Watchmen : _Music_from_the_Motion_Picture

1 `` please do n't have boner please do n't have boner ''

1 Movie still gives me the creeps

1 I agree , it was a great thriller and action movie , did n't know people do n't like it

1 Tacodile ... SUPREME *

1 3 is very good and I guarantee it was in the contract that they had to make new movies not redo his ...

1 > As a human I believe what you mean is : > As a human * with no financial interest in this property *

1 If that includes the fight with Gogo , absolutely

1 At the very least there would be some pretty good TS versions up within an hour or so on TPB etc .

1 Hehe exactly .

1 > * tips fedora you are taking the piss , correct ?

1 That 's all I 've read . They supposedly filmed a scene that goes along with the audio you hear . I figure it would just be some rubble shifting and then we see Koba crawl out of it or something .

1 [ Here 's this magnificent bastard 's wiki page ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Michiel_de_Ruyter ) . Destroying the English before the Americans could .

1 I used to almost feel like apologizing after I said I disliked Shia Lebouf , but these days it feels like a perfectly natural reaction to this MASSIVE douchebag .

1 He has stated that he 's been with a man before so you might be in luck .

1 Every time this set is reposted , it 's my signal to go get my oil changed .

1 When * Y Tu Mama Tambien * came out , Ebert had already been a critic for 35 years . I disagree completely that he ever changed his approach to reviewing movies or for advocating for what he believed in .

1 Yeah but the question was n't `` will I hate Toy Story '' ? Nobody knows the answer to that question , and yeah , it could go either way . But the question was `` are the Toy Story movies * worth watching * ? '' Assuming you think time spent watching movies / TV can be 'worth it , ' then the answer is an obvious yes , since they 're considered among the best movies ever made .

1 That clip is amazing . I 've never seen the movie but now I feel that I 've seen everything I need to know .

1 You ask all the wrong questions .

1 Not entirely true I 'm afraid . Some Blu-rays are no better than their DVD counterparts

1 You 're referring to the poster they actually used ...

1 But I 'd say they were aware of it . They probably have Space Fox News there to tell them who to hate .

1 Well you speak mexican , dont you ?

1 Or Superman ...

1 > Does this guy only work for art and not for money ? Pretty much . He 's one of the best living actors . He 's a method actor , as well , which makes for some intense stories of his preparation for roles . Here are some tidbits from his wiki : > In 1987 , Day-Lewis assumed leading-man status by starring in Milan Kundera 's * The Unbearable Lightness of Being * ... as a Czech surgeon whose hyperactive and purely physical sex life is thrown into disarray when he allows himself to become emotionally involved with a woman . During the eight-month shoot he learned Czech and first began to refuse to break character on or off the set for the entire shooting schedule . > Day-Lewis threw his personal version of `` method acting '' into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan 's * My Left Foot * which garnered him numerous awards , including the Academy Award for Best Actor . Daniel prepared for his role by frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin , where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities , some of whom had no speech . During filming , his eccentricities came to the fore , due to his refusal to break character . Playing a severely paralysed character on screen , off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair , and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires , all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown 's life , including the embarrassments . He broke two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks . > In 1992 , three years after his Oscar win , * The Last of the Mohicans * was released . Day-Lewis 's character research for this film was well-publicized ; he reportedly underwent rigorous weight training and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived , camping , hunting and fishing . He even carried a long rifle at all times during filming in order to remain in character and learned how to skin animals . > He returned to work with Jim Sheridan on * In the Name of the Father * , in which he played Gerry Conlon , one of the Guildford Four who were wrongfully convicted of a bombing carried out by the Provisional IRA . He lost a substantial amount of weight for the part , kept his Northern Irish accent on and off the set for the entire shooting schedule , and spent stretches of time in a prison cell . He also insisted that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him . > [ He starred in ] Jim Sheridan 's * The Boxer * as a former boxer and IRA member recently released from prison . His preparation included training with former boxing world champion Barry McGuigan . Following * The Boxer * , Day-Lewis took a leave of absence from acting by going into `` semi-retirement '' and returning to his old passion of woodworking . For a time his exact whereabouts and actions were not made publicly known . Day-Lewis has declined to discuss this period of his life , stating that `` it was a period of my life that I had a right to without any intervention of that kind . '' > After a five-year absence from filming , Day-Lewis returned to act in multiple Academy Award-nominated films such as * Gangs of New York * . In his role as the villain gang leader `` Bill the Butcher '' ... [ h ] e began his lengthy , self-disciplined process by taking lessons as an apprentice butcher , and while filming , he was never out of character between takes ( including keeping his character 's New York accent ) . At one point during filming , having been diagnosed with pneumonia , he refused to wear a warmer coat or to take treatment because it was not in keeping with the period ; however , he was eventually persuaded to seek medical treatment .

1 Ugh.. Time to book a flight I guess

1 Seriously , the last bond girl on the list is way hotter than the picture used . http : / i.imgur.com / rYfsk.jpg

1 That 's the first thing that 's ever gone wrong .

1 Results may vary , too .

1 Awesome save by your dad .

1 Wait , I found the pictures of those persecuted Catholics you were talking about . Beware , the [ album ] ( http : / imgur.com / a / Kcl7j ) you are about to see may be disturbing

1 It looks awkward because the site cropped it in the weirdest possible way from an [ already awkward pose ] ( http : / www.luckydrunks.com / wallpapers / wp-content / gallery / eliza-dushku / ElizaDushku_0023.jpg ) .

1 I 'm guessing his contract made that second one mandatory .

1 Send them an e-mail with the idea..

1 Fuck yea Airplane ! . I have done science and can personally promise it 's the funniest film ever made .

1 Loved that scene . That puts everything in perspective for him and you can tell when he gets the lock on Koba , he puts everything he as into it .

1 I 'm ok with this , if it means more interesting characters like he did in Nightcrawler , Enemy , and Prisoners . He 's in his prime I think , but it 's a shame he does n't get more recognition .

1 The Hunger Games are still very if not more popular with boys

1 He remembers everything about his fatha

1 We should all piss in his face

1 I went with a friend who could n't enjoy the rest of the movie after that scene .

1 * Angel Heart ( 1987 )

1 All I need is 100 million and some fat guys in suits .

1 If you enjoyed Mononoke , I 'd be surprised to hear you did n't enjoy Nausicaa . If you have n't seen it , imho it 's brilliant and works on similar levels . He also did the manga himself and it 's incredible .

1 iirc the first hour is pretty solid but once the film 's plot really begins it starts sucking .

1 Its a matter of taste I suppose , but the Heisei era is by far my favorite . It pays loving tribute to the classic monsters like Ghidorah and Mechagodzilla and introduces some neat new monsters . The continuity is also very nice if you 're looking to watch several films in a short span .

1 I really enjoyed that . I 've always loved claymation and this a good example of some artistic claymation .

1 Surely there would be a few hairs poking through the closed case ...

1 How is It 's a Wonderful Life not on this list ?

1 That 's because Dern wrote it . Laura Dern .

1 Apparently Ridley Scott says he was but Harrison Ford says he was n't .

1 Carrey has a ton of stinkers , no way .

1 Sometimes you can even see their skeleton flash for a few seconds . Scary shit .

1 It was just a completely forgettable experience for me , very much like Van Helsing . A brief disappointment , nothing more

1 Texas forever .

1 I watched that flick on video with my high school girlfriend . She fell asleep and slept through the whole damn movie . At the end , she woke to find me sitting rigid on the couch , blink-blink-blinking at the TV . Just totally traumatized .

1 I 'm pretty sure John Carter already cost the entire marketing team their jobs , as well as the studio chairman his .

1 `` I had always heard your entire life flashes in front of your eyes the second before you die . First of all , that one second is n't a second at all , it stretches on forever , like an ocean of time ... For me , it was lying on my back at Boy Scout camp , watching falling stars ... And yellow leaves , from the maple trees , that lined our street ... Or my grandmother 's hands , and the way her skin seemed like paper ... And the first time I saw my cousin Tony 's brand new Firebird ... And Janie ... And Janie ... And ... Carolyn . I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me ... but it 's hard to stay mad , when there 's so much beauty in the world . Sometimes I feel like I 'm seeing it all at once , and it 's too much , my heart fills up like a balloon that 's about to burst ... And then I remember to relax , and stop trying to hold on to it , and then it flows through me like rain and I ca n't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life ... You have no idea what I 'm talking about , I 'm sure . But do n't worry ... you will someday . '' http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=NtbbqjiFaGY

1 The coolest thing about this is the kid apparently went on [ become a filmmaker ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm4166551 / ) .

1 was going to say this myself- have gotten into arguments with friends over the end .

1 That was definitely one for me . Such a thought provoking film . May sound trashy , but `` Like Crazy '' was one for me too ; like a slightly less heartbreaking Blue Valentine .

1 Same here . Just sprayin hundreds of rounds , no reloads or jams .

1 My first thought as well , this was mentioned fairly recently over in /r/deadpool

1 Owch . Though I 've never heard anyone say that Watchmen was `` okay . '' It 's been love it or hate it with every person I 've asked about it . The people who hated it usually are people who did n't read the comics , though , and they expected a conventional superhero movie ; instead they got Watchmen .

1 yes it is

1 OMG the scene in the court house paying homage to To Kill a Mockingbird , I lost it

1 disqualified !

1 No , she was tripped the fuck out on prescription opiates . Guaranteed . Source : Just ... Just trust me on this .

1 > Bad Paul Walker movie Whoops , tautology !

1 One of the most mind-screwing movies I 've ever seen . My short take : Stabbed by one of his own guys in combat ... we do n't see but he does ... ..he has a death vision dream where he is trying to hang on to life , recall memories , and reconcile why he saw fellow soldiers acting so crazy to each other ... ..then he dies .

1 Pandering to American sentimentality does n't usually make for good film making . I love me some Zemikis , but he has n't made a movie I 've really loved in over a decade . having said that I 'll watch JGL in just about anything .

1 It is .

1 Seriously . I did n't know who to feel worse for at the end .

1 Galaxy Quest is awesome , they would like it .

1 I thought it was one of the most terrifying films in recent memory .

1 `` You fucking idiots , I said more explosions ! ! ! ! You call that a fucking explosion ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ''

1 Alien is amazing . One of the great cinematographic achievements in sci-fi . Outstanding sets , camera work , and creature design obviously . Often overlooked is the incredibly careful sound design . So many great noises clicking , bleeping computers , hissing vents , communication static ... all add to the trippy detachment of being alone in space . A nearly perfect film . And ... Barry Lyndon - I love reddit . Only here could you find so many fellow fans .

1 I agree . Some people did n't like it because they felt the romance was forced . But , really , if you think about it , they spend more time together than most couples do in hollywood movies . Cage spent at LEAST a year in the loop . I do n't know if it specifies how long in the book , but rest assured , it was a long time . It may have been just a brothers-in-arms thing , but spending that much time with someone ... I felt like it developed really naturally . I was very happy with it .

1 I 'd even argue that the 'final battle ' was n't the actual climax . I always thought Harry going into the forest and allowing Voldemort to kill him was the real climax . You know , Harry finally taking the allegiance of the last Hallow , the Stone , and facing death .

1 It looks ... not good . Too many rehashed gags from the original IMO .

1 Your powers of observation continue to serve you well .

1 What paperweights ? I just see a bunch of dildos on their desk . Is that what you 're talking about ?

1 This is ridiculous . What are Paranorman and The Lorax doing there ? And the Jurassic Park sequels ? And he misspelled The Exorcist . Come on .

1 Hey , I made this ! So cool to see it already made its way to Reddit .

1 Bro , do you even trolololo ?

1 One opened in my county . Even though the economy is shit . It 's still opened after 3 years so people must like them . You also do n't have to put up with noisy fuckers .

1 Hmm ... From what I have read , Han , Luke and Leia are not going to be main characters in Abrams ' movie either , they are likely going to be taking a back seat and new characters will be at the center of the story . You saw the trailer right ?

1 Prometheus ruined Alien ?

1 Enjoy your rare uncontroversial moment in the limelight .

1 Ahh the ole Eddie Murphy .

1 And he has a flaming sword ... combining all this , J = AA confirmed !

1 Mostly because it steered close enough to 'adaptation ' rather than remake . But yes , Infernal Affairs is ultimately the better movie for a number of reasons , and it 's kind of embarrassing that The Departed was the movie that won Scorsese the Oscar . An inferior remake is hardly the pinnacle of his achievements .

1 He is outstanding in The Fighter . Oscar well-deserved . The scene with the cake ... amazing .

1 He apparently also invented inertial dampeners .

1 Two actually , ca n't forget `` [ A Little Bitter ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=8XUV0yLcKtI & feature=kp ) '' .

1 Spoiler : She runs a lot .

1 `` The Human Centipede ''

1 Call the theater .

1 I would n't say either of those is that gratuitous . Compared to some of the scenes in the Indiana Jones movies the violence in mad Max is pretty tame . The jaw rip is of screen .

1 Assassin 's Creed : Black Flag .

1 Raimis 4

1 I can assure you it is not an easier to watch the second time .

1 Regardless of it being 1978 the Reeves ' Superman was the best Superman we 've ever had , and those movies still hold up . Do n't disregard it because they 're from the 70s / 80s . That 's just silly .

1 That scene and the one where he apologizes to the men after Pickett 's charge were my favourites of his .

1 A total bane you could almost say

1 nah , I 'll stay in and watch Wolf of Wallstreet . Also , a movie about a rich asshole .

But we aliens will clone her so you can pretend she loves you for a few hours ... then you both will die . '' Yippee . Happy ending .

1 He does get a bit heavy-handed at times , but I will take it if that is his flaw when taking chances . Mila 's character was a bit thin though .

1 The Tree of Life is a masterpiece and I 'm happy you see the beauty in it .

1 You do n't ?

1 I really believe it is a misunderstood film

1 Well that 's just like , your opinion , man . 8 / 10

1 Really ? Are n't all superhero movies about saving the world ? I thought it was the story that unfolds and the motivations and revelations of the players that make a film .

1 Has to be Arteton IMO

1 I think it comes down to the fact that he has some great ideas he just needs help filtering them into something workable . There 's a [ great article ] ( http : / secrethistoryofstarwars.com / marcialucas.html ) about George Lucas 's ex-wife , Marcia who seemed to have a lot to do with how great the original films were .

1 ... ... ... ... ... nothing at all ... ... ..nothing at all ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..

1 Fuck off , The Artist was a brilliant movie . Either way , Terrence Malick deserved it far more for Tree of Life .

1 Hahaha that garnered a good chuckle from the audience at the theatre I attended

1 Gremlins 2 : The new batch ?

1 +1 0xFA567B was sick

1 it 's good . but it was the feel bad movie of the year so of course it 's not popular . plus since most people think that espionage actually works something like a james bond movie , when a serious movie about espionage comes out and it does n't resemble james bond , people feel cheated . and that kid looked funny .

1 I ca n't wait for this . The comic-book style has really been brought out in this film and looks awesome .

1 I just remembered that ! It was great !

1 Well said . I 'll never forget how gut-wrenching it was watching Alex Murphy get gunned down like that . Granted , I was probably no older than 12 years old , but it was a powerful scene .

1 Which is the point . Verhoeven parodies the violence we see every day on TV that we have become inured to by going over the top .

1 Fine journalism by a fellow redditor ...

1 Absolutely . I love it to bits . It 's imaginative , energetic , painfully cheesy , and totally bonkers , but I think it works beautifully as a whole . Totally underrated .

1 Excellent opening scene .

1 Directed by Wes Anderson . And with Johnny Depp as Mario .

1 Also scored The World 's End so this is his 2nd collab with Edgar Wright .

1 This is the ultimate answer .

1 Maaan you had to remind me . I cried when [ Wash was killed . ] ( / spoiler ) Seriously , I liked the guy .

1 Definitely gave me a new appreciation for film and for just how much great cinema there is out there . No way I could pick a favorite though .

1 As an American it gives me a chub on

1 One of the examples of nearly perfect book-to-movie adaptation . Just great stuff .

1 Are you sure it 's not a guy saying this to a girl ? : `` I * will * find you ! '' ( Daniel Day-Lewis , `` Last of the Mohicans . '' )

1 Agreed . Also I want more actors from The Wire on TV lol .

1 Sarcasm vs internet . Internet wins !

1 I dig it

1 i can see why people think this comment is needlessly negative , but i have to admit it was my first thought , it does seem quite schmaltzy , and i do n't understand the point really , they seem to be trying to project something about humanity on it , i think it would have been better pitched as a comedy / adventure .

1 this is one of the best ever . I watched this with my family and we rewound it to see it again

1 It was an April Fools joke .

1 It 's pretty damn good . I do n't think they are nukes in the sense you are thinking , they are flying a giant ship designed to kick start a star through nuclear reactions , i think . I have n't watched it in quite a while though .

1 What do you think would have been a better ending ? The big theme of the film is facing your inner demons , which is what the wolves are metaphors for . At the end he finally has to face them head on ; no more running . And then given that , there 's no way he would be able to survive against all those wolves , so any ending where he lived and made it back home would have seemed unrealistic and cheesy . Also the ending mirrored his father 's poem perfectly ; `` once more into the fray ... ''

1 I still ca n't handle the autumnal season . The leaves , with the wind . Fuck . : (

1 It 's been an while since I have seem it ... but basically none of it is real . It 's all happening inside the serial killers head . John Cusak , The kid , the actress they are all split pieces of the killers mind fighting over control .

1 Read Rule 2 .

1 Awesomely quotable movie !

1 Definitely the Bourne Series .

1 Watching the new Total Recall just made me appreciate the original more .

1 This was not a `` director 's cut '' , this was a pre cut . It was cut down by Scorsese to make the movie , in his opinion , better .

1 Ca n't you see we talkin ' ? * White ? *

1 /r/circlejerk

1 That is because the movie critics are concerned about the * movie * elements while the others are concerned about the * science * in the movie . Both can be right in their views .

1 Yes , AMSM2 would be an open ending because the plot itself ends , but themes will continue into other films .

1 Very nice . Still want the uncut full version of Kill Bill though ! : )

1 Absolutely agree Pacific Rim number one , ca n't remember a time I had so much fun and so much excitement watching a movie before that !

1 Stupid ! You , soooo , STUUUUPID ! ! ! ! !

1 I do n't know about that . I like Danny McBride but I do n't think he would have been a better choice .

1 For sure . The 3D on this movie was impressive and perfectly used in the slow-mo shots .

1 dat hilarity

1 Smell em in the air ? Think I dropped my Oscar in that harbour over there ?

1 > Absolutely , the flag-waving nationalism in Chinese cinema is too often overlooked This is no different to nearly every Hollywood film and I would say that it 's not been overlooked . I 've seen many people mentioning it , I totally agree that it takes a lot away from the story , but you would be hard pressed to find many films set in war time that do n't do this and it 's far more 'overlooked ' in western film because we have been brought up and conditioned to see our historical enemies as evil , sub-human degenerates . There is always the goodies and the badies , look at any American WWII film .

1 I hope they do Apocalypse right . He is one of my favorite X-Men villains and if they fuck him up I 'm going to be mad . I want to see the Four Horsemen and Apocalypse just fucking up everything .

1 That 's not really what A Scanner Darkly is about .

1 That movie is all kind of fucked up . I would recommend it to everyone ! : )

1 Or any day . Nimoy 's a class act all the way . I consider myself lucky when someone like that is so willing to share their thoughts and talents over their entire lifetime . Peace and long life .

1 it 's called Brazil by terry Gilliam

1 > like Terminator or Star Wars , but they fail to realize that the years movies like this came out were also laced with their fair share of sequels True - especially when talking about Terminator 2 or Star Wars : `` The Empire strikes back '' ...

1 The Act of Killing was actualy well praised last year .

1 Also , if you have time , I recommend whatching the whole thing , because the interview is great and they ( mostly she ) also talk about movie aesthetics and symbolism , also comparing Apocalypse Now and Conan the Barbarian at the end . Just a great interview .

1 The problem I have with Thankskilling is the same one I have with Sharknado . They are n't `` so bad they 're good . '' They were purposefully meant to be bad . The whole reason that Birdemic , The Room , and Troll 2 are fantastic is because you 're laughing * at * the director and writers , not * with * them .

1 I have [ the song from that scene ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=jVjgY427qW8 ) on my pump-up playlist just because of how awesome that scene is

1 This is business not personal !

1 Avatar : 2009 Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the Ring : 2001

1 I think it 's sad how the character of a person is judged by a movie they were in . Personally , I liked Cedric , I could n't give a crap if he was in Twilight . One of my favorite actresses , Anna Kendrick , is in Twilight . Does n't change my opinion of her .

1 that 's not happening in the movies . In the comics thor is close to supermans level , probably higher and in the movie iron man held his ground against him . Secondly , assuming iron man is even on the east coast he is n't going 3000ish miles in minutes . No one is .

1 If those ARE the best jokes , this movie is in serious trouble .

1 I like it but personally I do n't think that would have marketed well . It 's even more vague and unhelpful that Edge of Tomorrow .

1 Def not explained in x1 . We do n't really learn about any of the villains in that one besides magneto

1 it just came out this weekend , so the wow factor is still in effect . give it a few more days till some funny meme pops out of some cat that will take its place

1 Ah yes se-seven-en .

1 does n't feel like it warrants more story . concluded pretty tightly

1 Yeah , pretty much . I remember the astronaut apes ( narrators ) saying the message was written in `` Earth 's language '' . One could assume this is significantly in the future , and the apes have long mastered space flight , so they 're probably all over by then , but originally , there were at least two planets with apes and humans . ( also , if anyone 's wondering , yes , it is weird that there would be apes and humans in another planet . That seems scientifically implausible , even considering convergent evolution . But the book is kind of a social commentary , and does n't worry too much about how realistic it is , like most early sci-fi ) .

1 What the cuss ? That movie is just a little ... . * arm wiggle * different .

1 Only those ants with exceptionally good vision .

1 what about rule of thirds ? ? ?

1 Do n't forget Eric Roberts .

1 I 'll never understand that viewpoint . To me , Intolerable Cruelty is fantastic and feels front to back like a Coen Brothers movie . It seems to me like fans just resented sitting in the same theater as the people who were suckered into thinking it * was * a bad romantic comedy by the trailers .

1 Actually from what I 've read they 've been given the cars for free , if not paid . They had a huge list of automakers that wanted their cars in the movie and were willing to give just about any car . ( Just think of all of those bumblebee style camaros you see , it 's a HUGE amount of good publicity for the car . )

1 It 's from 'Dumb & Dumber ' . IIRC it was improv by Jim Carrey .

1 `` * BOMBBABEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE * `` ~Shia Lebeouf

1 Love the Branagh Much Ado About Nothing , with the exception of Keanu Reeves .

1 Yeah , he 's `` Non-Standard Nerdy Background Character '' in a lot of movies and TV shows . That 's become his shtick , almost . His name 's Jesse Heiman .

1 Maybe it 's part of the suit ? Also , just in case anyone else is listening in .

1 For a second I thought the joke was 'lastname ' until I saw the mistake in Brian .

1 I 'm glad someone did . I did have up-votes in the positives when the thread was new , but then then people did n't realize it was satire , or thought it was unfunny because they take parenting * way * too seriously .

1 i love watching movies high so have a few . for laughs ; i love you man , forgetting sarah marshall , severance , the naked gun , mystery team , the losers , austin powers and that list could go on and on all night . for shock / awe ; inception , moon , troll hunter , i saw the devil , the good the bad the wierd , watchmen , tron legacy , starship troopers , avatar , 300 , the 4th kind . thats just a few i can think of that i watched stoned the first time , and definitely enjoyed them . severance was a hoot !

1 Dawson ( James Van Der Beek ) and Piefucker ( Jason Biggs ) in Jay & Silent Bob , too .

1 Christian Bale will always be Bateman to me .

1 I disagree . I find these movies are more than well written . Most offer a good dose of clever humor and emotionally realized characters . The CG is plentiful it 's true , but I think it 's balanced . The only movie that I can even come close to critiquing in terms of writing would be The Avengers , because it 's very by-the-book , and the main conflict is n't as interesting as the individual conflicts between the main characters . In fact , I think it may be one of the weakest Marvel movies , with Iron Man 2 a close second .

1 Or only in passing in 1963 . They did meet , but not enough for anything to happen .

1 It 's a drama about a very specific human experience , not that boring if you ask me .

1 Darkman-doing grimdark comicbook movies before it was cool

1 Charlie do n't surf !

1 No idea , the dead monster is a completely new one made for the reboot .

1 Well , then I have [ good news ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt3501632 / ? ref_=fn_al_tt_5 ) for you . Seems they have the basic story idea planned out and will be working on a script as it reaches their pipeline . So there is a real chance of you getting your wish . I 'm very happy for you .

1 This should be higher

1 Glad I 'm not the only one

1 A Clockwork Orange is one of my all time favorite movies and even though I have seen it several times now , I can say that you can definitely get everything you need from that movie out of one sitting . In fact , I almost kind of wish I left it alone after that first viewing , as it was just so perfect in my mind the first time . I literally could n't find a flaw . I still love the shit out of it , and have to watch it at least once a year , but I can definitely understand leaving it at just one viewing .

1 I need this in 2560x1440 stat .

1 They really should have just called * The Expendables * `` American Action Movie Homage - The Movie ''

1 A new kind of family .

1 You misspelled 'fucking horrible ' . Tarantino is good with his version of movies , but whenever he tries to deviate from his style of movies he fails miserably .

1 They talked for two hours . Favorite movies probably came up and apparently the guy had n't seen much . Michael wrote down a list of stuff the guy should see .

1 I think you may have forgotten what a normal , healthy woman looks like . Maybe you should leave your house .

1 Even better , its Patrick Stewart holding a pug .

1 I believe it 's an inside joke that sound editors just wo n't drop . I can imagine it being some kind of accomplishment to slip it in there as obnoxiously as possible .

1 That really was criminal . To not even give Fincher the Best Director title was an insult , really .

1 Everyone thinks that .

1 As a kid I never really got that .

1 Brad Pitt has done reasonably well managing his own ego ( or the public perception of it ) to a certain extent . Perhaps he can help Mr LeBeouf put some things in perspective . It is always a shame to see talent and star branding wasted . Take Miss Lohan for example . Although everyone likes a redemption story , but few are as successful as RDJ . A Bill Murray quote in a Gawker article about Chevy Chase recently : > `` When you become famous , you 've got like a year or two where you act like a real asshole , '' Bill Murray told Tom Shales and James Miller when they interviewed him for Live from New York , their oral history of Saturday Night Live . `` You ca n't help yourself . It happens to everybody . You 've got like two years to pull it together ? or it 's permanent . ''

1 I want to see more of Fillion .

1 Apparently you have n't read WWZ . It explains , in great detail , exactly how today 's modern militaries could initially lose to a zombie hoard . That is one of the reasons why the book is so great . Brooks really fleshed the zombies out , so to speak . The only disbelief he genuinely asks the reader to suspend is that the dead could rise again . Otherwise , it 's a very logical book .

1 People have high expectations because Winter Soldier was such a huge game changer and took SHIELD out of the picture .

1 I had to squint to see Ant Man 's .

1 You do know Prost did the same thing to him the year before right ?

1 That movie was both SO bad and SO good at the same time

1 That should be the tagline

1 How will they ever portray his sarcastic wit and hijinks while he 's worrying about getting stop-and-frisked and choked to death by the NYPD ... Then again , maybe the writers will address it .

1 I thought it was rather obvious .

1 I would absolutely love to see this . Shame I 'll never get to New York : (

1 That 's not how it works

1 I know * that * .

1 It 's called imagination , most people in Hollywood do n't have it .

1 Buy her some of the soft matte-coated needles . no click . Let 's say Grandma was driving me bonkers one day , so I researched .

1 I mean , it 's not like they 're going to stop being stoned . Pot has n't lost any of it 's potency ( I believe ) just because it 's legal . There may not be quite as many watch out for the cops scenes , but there 's no reason for the genre to go away .

1 The joke was served to him on a silver platter .

1 Scott Pilgrim would beg to differ

1 you need to see WAY more movies

1 That 's what they said about * Peter Pan * , but look who listened .

1 His chemistry with Jess Chastain in A Most Violent Year is amazing

1 Pacific Rim proves otherwise . However , when you 're dealing with a movie that was originally a HARD fucking * HARD * R ( Peter Weller getting fucking DESTROYED in slow motion with a shotgun , then shot square in the face full frame closeup ... just watched this movie a couple of days ago ) , and you decide to try and make it a PG-13 what you 're doing is eliminating the thing that brought people into the movie in the first place .

1 Disney have always been good at making those family-friendly inspirational sports films , and this seems like another one to add to the pile . It 's a bit 'white guy saves the day ' though , and I hope it does n't just turn into Costner teaching all these Mexicans how to be all they can be with a tacky 'the American dream is what you make of it ' stuck on the end . Trailer actually shows off the film pretty well I think . It looks very well made , and although I probably wo n't watch it , I think it 'll do reasonably well .

1 I do n't know , I thought it was pretty awful .

1 I love Richard E Grant .

1 Are you calling it an opera on the grounds that there was limited spoken dialogue ? Because a far better distinction between the genres is one based on whether the story is told through music , or words . I would not be so quick to distinctly categorise it as either , much less exclude it from one or the other . Mis was not fantastic , but `` Chinese water torture '' is an horrendous overstatement - no matter how figuratively deployed . It seems most of your vitriol is derived from the director . Incidentally , you 've not said a thing about Sacha Baron Cohen .

1 You are High .

1 Great , maybe now there wo n't be so many spoilers floating around .

1 You know nothing .

1 You do n't HAVE to like it but I 'd say just relax and rewatch it like a month later I thought The Master was good when I first watched it . Then I rewatched it and loved it . Give it some time . Of course it just may not be your thing .

1 In defense of the reference , this is /r/movies . I mean , we 're talking about a reference about pop culture , in a thread about the pop culture that it 's referencing , on a board about that genre of pop culture on a website that 's pretty much dedicated to pop culture and even creates it 's own pop culture . That 's like going to a football game and telling all the fans `` we get it , you like football now stop cheering so loud '' . tl ; dr stop harshing our mellow man

1 I 'm no scientist , but I 've read that it is * extremely * accurate . From the story to the science .

1 fantastic film , really underrated . I think the advertising had more to do with it than anything . They portrayed it as some generic horror film . It was n't .

1 Having watched all seven seasons of Buffy more than twice a piece , Firefly , Serenity , Dr . Horrible , Toy Story , and now The Avengers , I think I 've seen enough of Joss Whedon to say this : what the * fuck * are you on about ?

1 Yeah , Thor could do that to me ; )

1 Really ? Name 3 movies where a large plot point is relativity .

1 Probably The Dark Knight Trilogy . Not only did they have great action sequences , but also great character development as well .

1 And * Lenny Kravitz . *

1 The script has n't been leaked , only rumors regarding what his next project might be .

1 AWESOME !

1 Are n't we all..

1 Also because this is kind of the obvious result , and a director making a simple choice that improves a movie should n't be considered mind-blowing .

1 `` Harumph ! '' `` Watch yer ass ! ''

1 Blue can give better results for tricky shots if you have lots of light . That 's pretty much it .

1 I love the moment when Furiosa asks Max what to call him and he just replies : `` Does it matter ? '' His weariness and humility in that moment is just perfect and Tom Hardy looks just so cool saying it . He 's absolutely the type of guy you 'd want on your side after the apocalypse .

1 [ I like the idea of the Hulkbuster suit coming out in Iron Man 3 with Hulk as a diversionary antagonist / side plot .

1 Agreed . Hawkeye and Thor needed fuller introductions because most folks did n't know who they are . I 'd say more people know who Flash and Wonderwoman are .

1 If your daughter 's white , make sure she gets a black friend ( and vice-versa ) . In ten years , I wan na see Psych become a reality ! But seriously , good job on the parenting !

1 Really , A New Hope is a movie where the bad guys win . Terrorists blow up the government 's peace-keeper ? Yeah , you were rooting for the wrong team .

1 First thing that came to mind . Hey , girls , wan na please that guy you 're after ? Slut it up ! Still do n't get the flying car , though . Maybe Sandy took things too far and OD'ed with Danny , and they 're just ascending to heaven .

1 Her name is literally in the title , it actually took you more effort to type that than it would to google it and figure it out for yourself

1 To be honest , I think that 's where the got the inspiration for the accents . Either that or they got coached by the voice actors from the Dead Island .

1 This is the only correct answer .

1 Respect .

1 I too will scream `` YESSSS ! ! ! ! '' for all in the theater to hear . Followed by , `` FUCK THE PREQUELS ! ''

1 it 's a synopsis of a plot . How can you easily judge it as stupid ? Here 's a synopsis : some guy finds money at a shootout and a crazed maniac with a dora the explorer haircut chases him for about an hour and a half to get the money . I guess No Country For Old Men was a stupid plot .

1 Yes we can . We turn off our brain and enjoy the shit out of it . For a lot of us younger car people it played a large role in getting us into cars . Shit PW was all about the cars . That man 's garage was awesome

1 And yet he still terrifies me .

1 Funny . I always see the opposite . Always absolutely ridiculous statements like 'Why did n't he lead the villain away ' or 'Man of Murder ' or 'DC does n't know what they 're doing ' . Regarding your main point though , the problem is n't the overwhelming like or dislike per movie , it 's that it 's virtually impossible to hold a proper group discussion in this format . If you 're caught in the wrong current , the dissenting opinion is downvoted to non existence leaving just an echo chamber .

1 90 % of the content we consume in Australia is from the US , but archaic distribution models mean that access to that content is either non-existant or slow in coming . Unfortunately , when that is coupled with the fact that we are active participants in this `` global community '' we call the internet , a problem arrises.. We 're subjected to the advertising for this content , we 're part of the discussions , we see it covered in our entertainment news , we 're hit with all the same demand generation that Americans are ... ... . and then when the content launches we are cut out . I 'm not justifying piracy , just offering an alternate view . I 'm sure there are people that pirate because they 're just cheap . I am positive however that a large part of the piracy problem is a direct result of demand generation , coupled with an inability to access the content once it launches .

1 Two things to remember about back-of-the-envelope studio profitability : * The studio only gets 45-55 % of the box office gross * The studio spends ( generally ) about 50 % in excess of the production budget on prints & advertising $ 130M gross ~ $ 65M studio revenue $ 102M production budget ~ $ 153M production + P & A The studio wo n't make back approximately $ 90M on home viewing

1 I agree . Not everything needs a moral . Is n't it enough to just tell a story ?

1 EASILY Idris Elba 's best role . He kills it as Stringer Bell . Probably one of the best villains on TV and a few others are right there in the same show with him . It 's just a really smart role that 's made better by an actor that makes it feel authentic and that 's really the great thing about The Wire as a show . Practically every character , even the more absurd ones , are believable . It 's very easy to believe these people exist and to a certain extent , they do because most of the stories and characters are inspired by real events and people . Some may say that I 'm exaggerating but I genuinely believe that The Wire is that show that every fan of TV as a medium should at least see a season or two of .

1 I did n't hate it but I understand why people hate it .

1 That 's a pretty specific time to day to be right on .

1 Somebody 's gon na get their dickhole smashed . My fav

1 * heyyyooooooooo *

1 Oh God that killed me too . Secretly I want to slip Man of the Hour by Pearl Jam into the sound system on the day my Dad finally passes away .

1 I say it 's about time . He 's great in the role ( despite his height ) but I 've long since grown bored with how everything needs to revolve around Wolverine . First Class was an excellent break from the character . There 's an entire universe of interesting mutants , lets explore some of them , Fox !

1 Literally . Using the literal definition .

1 It 's an X-Men movie . Only one X-Men movie is not a Wolverine movie and even he cameod in it .

1 > Soundtrack by Rebecca Black , Justin Beiber as the new bond girl . FTFY

1 Fair point , and I did dwell on that thought prior to my decision to go with that spelling . I chose it as such to make it clear that it was a simple racist joke and not just a racist comment . Something that my use of an exclamation / question mark might not have conveyed . But thank you for pointing that out anyways you fuckin ' heeeb .

1 go back to dark knight and look at how Nolan sets up the film as a set of elaborate prisoner 's dilemmas .

1 Dude , the headline of the article is `` Megan Fox sets aside her problems with Michael Bay. '' Come on .

1 Being 7'2 '' helps .

1 Go to the range and try this out . I think you might be surprised .

1 Awesome ! Good luck with it ! Take a lot of practice and patience but it 's worth it . = )

1 I think it was made from Michael Crichton 's * Eaters of the Dead * , which was itself , of course , a kind of retelling of * Beowulf * .

1 Watch the entire movie , and then see if you still feel the same way .

1 Well , he could at least look good .

1 The Sandlot .

1 Batman is widely recognized as one of the most intimidating heroes in comics . Ultimate Spider-Man is a nerdy teenager .

1 He just knows

1 2 ?

1 `` but there she is . Can you see ? He trapped her inside a mirror . Every mirror . '' Why do I always have to remember this line right when I walk into the bathroom in the dark at night .

1 ? ? Doo dah , doo dah ? ?

1 That 's why the name speaks for itself , JoBlows

1 Sure , that WOULD make Ultron menacing but instead we get `` evil Tony Stark '' essentially who never once throws us a curveball and is entirely predictable . The ending was the biggest deus ex machina I 've ever seen . `` Quick Thor , just blow this up ! '' What an intelligent , convenient solution that suddenly takes much of the weight from Ultron 's plan when it 's so easily foiled . Basically it was never a question of can Ultron destroy life on Earth . Just can we get a portion of this city 's population off the rock before we blow it to pieces . And the Hawkeye stuff was necessary , but awkwardly handled and basically shoe horned in like they suddenly realized we 're over ten movies into the Marvel universe and we still do n't know a damn thing about one of the main Avengers . Pretty bland too . Hulk and Widow was cringey . I 've never seen so much distracting product placement . The entire movie was a commercial for Samsung , Adidas , Starbucks and more . And Quicksilver 's character development was essentially non-existent , which made his death sad for all of two minutes before Hawkeye started cracking jokes laying beside his dead body . It was the worst Marvel movie I 've seen . Like it was designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator and basically just existed to make money .

1 I think it would be cool for him to come in with a bang but explain his origins as other characters find out about him . We can learn his past while in the present but not waste 30 min on it .

1 welcome to the world of music .

1 Grills : (

1 I think you 're getting down voted more because that does n't make much sense . Reddit is very liberal , so they would want a movie dealing with homosexuality ( a very liberal topic ) to win over a movie about ... racism ( another very liberal topic ) ?

1 Of course they 're different on film , because people CHOOSE to write them differently ! So many writers appeal to lazy and outdated tropes of male and female behaviour .

1 Pulp Fiction .

1 It has been out for a while .

1 It 's just a matter of people defining failure differently . These threads are confusing if you do n't specify what you 're talking about . I do n't know if you saw but the person you replied to edited their comment to say they are not talking about the box office or how much money it will make .

1 Jumped the Sharkticon .

1 Well thats /r/movies for you . But if you really want people to respond to your comment , how about actually explaining why you thought it was a misguided movie rather than just saying it ? Goes both ways .

1 The fact that they never meet , interact in any way or possibly even * know about each other * is one of the most hilarious , awesome things about that movie . I did n't even realize it until after the fifth or sixth time I 'd seen it .

1 North By Northwest : In the feel good comedy of the year , Roger Thornhill ca n't seem to get anything right . Fed up with his Manhatten lifestyle , Thornhill embarks on a psychedelic fueled adventure hallucinating he is a spy and that the people he encounters in his travels are enemy agents out to get him .

1 fuck you

1 But what better position for him to be in ? He needs to ensure that they * are n't * stopped , that they 're given free reign to complete the tricks . As an FBI agent , the man is a fucking idiot - they repeatedly tell him to look at the bigger picture , and he does n't . He falls for every trick they throw at him , and allows them to get away at every turn - at one point , they actually say that anyone who shouts 'STOP ! ' will be mobbed by audience members , and he does it anyway . There is no reason for him to be that stupid , or for him to repeatedly fail to learn from his mistakes , except if he is trying to keep up the image of chasing them , while still allowing them to escape at each turn . Somebody told me that there are scenes where he keeps up the pretence despite nobody else being around , which would be the one flaw - but I do n't think that 's true ( we 'd each only seen the film once at the time ) . I need to watch it back through and check , because I 'm pretty sure there are n't - there 's just the scene at the bar , which does n't count because his partner , and loads of FBI agents , are still milling around .

1 Yeah but that 's Clive freaking Owen . He could create oozing sexual chemistry with a microwave oven .

1 Did you watch it high ?

1 Public . Why would you even ask that ? Fuck off .

1 It 's understandable . You were probably a Matrix freak though right ? You should n't be getting downvoted so much . It is surprising though .

1 I wish he actually said `` poof ''

1 Get out

1 The Geppetos of Metal

1 I had a bad cheesecake a few months back , have n't been able to try another one . I just ca n't bring myself to take that first bite .

1 I had no idea Stephen was such a horse lover .

1 the fly over asgard

1 There are only 30 days in June .

1 My professors refused to take this as a real excuse for walking in 30 minutes late .

1 So that 's why this movie is called that .

1 ... the last 30 seconds is what made Prometheus bad ?

1 Agatha Christie 's Poirot is amazing and you watch them all on youtube .

1 That 's Bonnie Hunt , lol .

1 Will Ginger have to go back on the game ?

1 I could be persuaded that there is a reason good enough to keep an orca in a tank if it really had to be ( e.g. injury or something ) . However , I could never see a satisfactory reason to continue to breed captive orcas . I agree they are institutionalized , and manufacturing additional animals in that environment for commercial gain of a publicly held company , regardless of charitable contribution , is not cool .

1 I ca n't tell you how happy I am to see some love for Ravenous . I can only hope to one day listen to `` Boyd 's Journey '' on my deathbed ... http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=vLt98WxrYAw

1 I was really hoping someone on the other end of the radio responded with `` good luck ! '' with an Albanian accent .

1 Ugh watching most of the skits is becoming a struggle , Im only really watching to see Bill ... now what . The new talent that has been brought in is horrible , they are struggling to find anyone people will really remember as well as Bill and Kristen Wiig .

1 No , this is indicative of the contents of the movie ! It clearly tells you something happens in it !

1 [ torrent ] ( http : / isohunt.com / torrent_details / 331351077 / Harmy ? tab=summary )

1 Yeah , it 's not just black people . It 's just ghetto people and assholes . I live in New Orleans which is like the capital for black people and my movie going experience is fine . Sometimes there will be some kids or hood rats that are loud and annoying , but it 's not just black people . Not even half of the time . Get out of here with your old world views .

1 The same reason as professional athletes : because the work they do generates hundreds of millions or billions of dollars worth of revenue and profits by reaching millions of people . Would you want a piece of the pie you helped create ? RDJ is brilliant as Tony Stark , basically irreplaceable at this point . He has carried two franchises on his shoulders , you can not just swap any other actor into the role and expect the result to be an equal amount of profits .

1 Word . Also : DSV > 2032

1 You really have to be in a certain mood to watch Kubrick films or it will just feel dragged out .

1 /r/WritingPrompts : -Batman is the bad guy and the villains have to team up to take him down . -Batman 's villain 's children grow up to fight Batman Jr . -Batman finds himself in the Marvel Universe . -Batman is replaced by his doppelganger ManBat . -Batman & the Joker finally fuck .

1 Those are n't really sequels . They were movies with the same characters , but they were n't connected by any sort of narrative . Most episodes of , say , South Park are n't really sequels , even though they take place in the same universe with the same characters .

1 I 'm from Australia where baseball would only appear on television if we pulled off an Olympic win ( in fact , I 'm not sure if it even is an Olympic Sport . Silly me ) . Apart from knowing the basic rules ( courtesy of * Baseketball * ) , my knowledge of the sport , and indeed the dealings of free agency sports , is rather limited . However I absolutely loved the film and found it completely understandable . If I missed out on anything , it did n't occur to me . * Shameless self plug * - Check out my [ review ] ( http : / belatedlobster.tumblr.com / post / 14173539098 / moneyball-review ) if you wish .

1 Whaaaa ?

1 This film looks absolutely incredible . This may revitalize Terrence Howard .

1 Stop not liking the things that I like !

1 I checked out the article just to make sure they included Crucial Taunt .

1 You literally just said `` all movies blow '' .

1 The paintings man ... Awwww the little girl in the painting . So fucked up . On many levels

1 Reading the synopsis of Buchwald 's treatment , I 'm baffled as to how this was n't tossed out . The only real similarities between Buchwald 's treatment and Murphy 's script are that the main protagonist is from Africa , and part of each takes place in a ghetto . Hell , Sascha Baron Cohen 's last movie sounds more like Buchwald 's treatment than * Coming To America . *

1 Laughed my ass off throughout ... ..but seriously , Titanic was a great film .

1 The scene where he 's `` slashing '' up the steel ladder is what really did it for me , unbelievable shitty effects

1 You 're terrible . You should 've let her have the surprise in RotS .

1 Yeah , I think it 's unfair how a lot of the criticism has been aimed at Linklater . I think it was an idea he meant to use to enhance the film , not to have it serve as the primary selling point .

1 I do not believe there is a more perfect douchey name than Brett Ratner .

1 [ Earth Girls Are Easy ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0097257 / ) . I know , the few people who have heard of it think it 's a lousy movie , but it makes me laugh so much !

1 From the poster , the working title should have been `` Ron , You 're a Fucking Idiot . ''

1 It 's actually a B-side to the song off the Batman & Robin soundtrack . The Batman song is `` The End is the Beginning is the End '' and is basically an uptempo version of `` The Beginning is the End is the Beginning '' .

1 Unexpected choice , although I 'm happy as long as Netflix is pumping out new content .

1 Such a sleeper and perfectly casted

1 I actually liked Bloodline . I thought the space scenes felt more like Doom than the movie by the same title was .

1 In theatres 2015

1 I say School of Rock will be .

1 The blurb : * In 2159 there are two classes : the very rich who live on a station created by man , Elysium , and others who live on Earth sacked and overcrowded . Secretary Rhodes ( Jodie Foster ) is a member of the government who would do anything to pass anti-immigration laws and to preserve the luxurious living of the citizens of Elysium . This does not prevent the inhabitants of the earth to try to integrate Elysium by all possible means . One day , the unlucky Max ( Matt Damon ) , driven accepts a mission that could save his life , but also restore the balance between these two worlds . *

1 I always enjoyed the tension between cyclops and wolverine . So underused by Fox .

1 I personally think the shower scene is the greatest use of editing and one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history .

1 Best of luck to you .

1 Here in the US the fat people are the poor people . They eat junk food and fast food and smoke and do n't get exercise .

1 Yup saddle em with jobs at age 5 . Children should n't have any fun or have big dreams . They need to immediately understand that life is a grueling bitch , and prepare for drone work until they die .

1 I love love love the `` Yes I do . '' So much is in those three words .

1 YES ! ! This should be topside . I could n't remember some of the better antidepressant movies off the top of my head . Birdy num nums for sure .

1 Of course ! ! You fucking idiot ! ! !

1 Where are you getting that from ? Are you the general public ? All we 've gotten from the film is the cast and one official photo . A trailer has n't been released . A * poster * has n't even been released . Where are you getting your impression from the general public if people have n't even gotten the chance to get a glimpse at it ?

1 * SPOILERS * This movie 's gut-punch final black joke pulled on the protagonist is one of the most chilling endings ever to a movie `` thriller . '' ( Whatever you do , do n't watch the American version , unless you want to get angry . Although it 's made by the same director , the U.S. producers thought their audience was too immature to stomach the original conclusion ... and so forced the remake to have an ending that was upbeat and vengeful . It 's pathetic . )

1 lel , indeed le sir ! one upgoat , coming right up !

1 You 're seriously going into my post history to be patronizing because I called out your post for being unnecessary ... Just ... just stop .

1 Too bad he 's a shitty actor

1 Because she won an oscar ? Just a guess .

1 Why Johnny Ringo , you look like somebody just walked over your grave .

1 Let 's just be glad the Last Airbender is n't up there .

1 Man ... if that did n't open the memory doors .

1 ( ? ? ? ? ? ? )

1 I mean , they 'd known each other , but he 'd always just said `` there 's Ron 's sister '' it seemed . He 'd never seemed to notice her as an actual human being of her own . Which , I get that romance can work like that especially in the age group they 're in , but writing wise it felt last second `` oh , Harry needs a girl ''

1 Dystopia does n't necessarily always deal with a lot of science but is generally considered to be a part of the genre . Science fiction is a really diverse genre which is more noticeable in print than it is in cinema .

1 Roger Ebert definitely agreed with you .

1 I was thinking the exact same thing .

1 I absolutely loved The Pacific , but I will say that I found the story-telling to not be quite as good as BoB . Their choice to focus on three separate narratives rather than one linear story kinda caused the story to lose something that BoB had . That said , I still love watching it repeatedly .

1 American Psycho , Enemy , Primer , Donnie Darko ,

1 Given that Gandalf is my favorite character , I would not agree . Besides , why should anyone care what George R.R . Martin thinks about Tolkien 's story ? I think Martin 's story would be better if it was n't so fucking long and not everyone died .

1 Everything starring Bill Cosby .

1 Get out .

1 I guess you missed the part where he is married to a black chick .

1 And he was goddamn perfect in Tropic Thunder . `` I 'd like you to step back and literally FUCK YOUR OWN FACE ! ``

1 Paranorman . I was not ready ...

1 Thanks to arachnophobia , I ca n't even .

1 Ironman plays a good RDJ .

1 The Road

1 I agree with this 100 % . Every time a joke would hit that was hilarious , I 'd sit there for minutes going `` Okay , there are a lot of jokes . I 'm just waiting for one to be funny again . '' It just felt slow .

1 That same quote jumped out at me , but I differ on the takeaway . As director , Del Toro is in charge of production , which has n't started yet . It 's really not in his job description to figure out how to adapt the thing . Kaufman is working on it , and Del Toro is attached . Really the lesson is that because of the absurdity of auteur theory , Del Toro gets interviewed for a brief conversation he had , while the guy doing the actual work gets mentioned second .

1 I wish I would of posted correct information but yes , I was not qualified to drive that car . I could of killed someone and myself

1 Chevy Chase is always credited last on the opening credits . I 'm sure that contractually they had to do leave it in that order , even for a custom sequence like that one .

1 Read the book too . Could n't go anywhere near the movie .

1 Ive seen the movie twice now , yesterday being the second time . Mann was afraid of dying alone so he faked his data killed his bot to have people come and save him . Since Coop found out that Plan A was n't going to happen he wanted to go back to Earth and be with his daughter , who thinks that he abandoned her , leaving Brand and everyone else to continue with Plan B. Mann needed Coop 's ship to get to Edmund 's planet so he has to kill him and then go on to try to save humanity `` for Cooper '' as Mann says right before leaving him to die . Its a poorly thought out plan by a desperate man , willing to do anything not to die alone .

1 Daredevil is technically a Disney tv show..

1 My main indication was the suits that the figure is wearing appeared to be very similar if not identical . But you 're correct in terms of the scale , as we know from alien the space Jockey and his chair are huge in comparison with humans .

1 The last half hour of Sunshine has truly spectacular music .

1 I call it the Guy Ritchie cut .

1 I was thinking this : * So Colin Farell goes Neo on a bunch of stormtroopers , escapes 5th Element style while bitches hit eachother with the force of Michael Bays Transformers . * WTF part of this is * Total Recall * ?

1 Chris O'Donnell

1 Janie Joop Jorp

1 The plot they 're using in the movie is that since he is human flesh ( essentially ) outside , they he will age . That 's at least what I 've read anyways . http : / 3.bp.blogspot.com / -djXiasOQL98 / UbgrxGHXN9I / AAAAAAAAMQE / Z8K1V-_k5g0 / s1600 / allow-it.gif

1 Yeah I believe that was the Winter Soldier punching someone into a heloplane turbine on the helicarrier . If there was a huge spray of blood instead of a kickass explosion , woild be rated R .

1 Sounds like a great friend .

1 I personally think it was far better .

1 do n't condenscend me maaaaan . I 'll fucking kill ya

1 I dont know about you but I prefer 80085 .

1 The jeager kaiju fights were just so damn fun to watch .

1 compared to JP1 it does .

1 please elaborate ...

1 That 's different . Spider-man 3 was awful .

1 For the record , this is n't B-Roll . Very enjoyable nonetheless . Behind the Scenes videos often help maintain the glamour of making movies . I love watching just raw unedited clips for once

1 > gem kill me

1 ^ False internet fact .

1 It 's both .

1 We mods can only play `` clean up '' since submissions hit our page first . The ones you saw , in all likelihood , just had n't been removed * yet * . Sometimes that takes 5 minutes , sometimes 4 hours .

1 Who would the contract be with ? Arby 's ?

1 Yeah it was still awesome because of that and you have to be lighthearted about celeb cameos .

1 Be that as it may , I would have preferred to discover that myself rather than have someone else ruin it for me by telling me .

1 Ca n't please everyone can you ?

1 Magnento was shown to have his powers returning at the end of 3 . I think it was implied you could keep powers shut off if a dosage is maintained . It does n't seem like it was a one shot sort of thing though

1 Neither were the Pterasaurs from JP3 but hey , it 's the movies ? lol Anyway , I think the plesiosaurus would fit perfectly because he really is Jurassic unlike the T-rex .

1 This is partially my point . No production is going to be perfect and there will be times that something is missed or forgotten or neglected . When this happens , a lot of the time it 's easier to re-animate rather than re-mocap . The other side of this is is how clean the data comes in . I have never encountered a system that is perfect , especially when dealing with very close markers , such as on the face . There will always be jitter that will have to be fixed that changes the performance in some minute way . But even more so than these , is the more technical nature of how mocap ( especially facecap ) is transferred on to a facial rig . That model had to be made by a modeler . That rig had to be set up by a rigger which was based on the model and it 's capabilities . Then , after the mocap connected to the rig , which had nothing to do with the mocap , an animator had to take that and tweak it- sometimes making very few changes , but other times completely re-animating entire shots . And on a big production , it 's not ONE animator , but MANY animators . And just to be clear , my job requires me to know the entire pipeline- from modeling to rendering- and I have and still do all of it . Modeling , Rigging , Animation , Mocap , Rendering even some Lighting . My point is- when dealing with CG , the actor 's performance is just the base . There are a dozen or more people involved before and after the actor delivers his performance- and for much longer than the actor ever had to spend on set . Giving the Oscar to the actor is disingenuous and completely ignores the process . That would be the equivalent of giving the world cup only to the goalie rather than the entire team . Yes he 's important , but he damn sure did n't do it on his own .

1 Umm , he 's kinda busy right now .

1 Yes , my friend 's brother works in editing and sits for months on sometimes 5 seconds of film . My friend does n't follow marvel and was describing his bro 's work on `` that scene where the green stuff is dripping on that guy , '' and I got overly excited telling him about my favorite moment of undeniable foreshadowing .

1 Sure this thread is a list-popular-accessible-movies circlejerk but if I had seen this in high school it might have been enlightening . Even now , I 've added Synechdoche and a couple others to my list of movies to watch . As OP notes , this is an impossible task just for fun . Maybe it even makes sense for the first 5 movies that someone watches to be readily accessible . If the first 5 movies I saw were Trash Humpers , 8 ? , Rashomon , A Space Odyssey and Mulholland Drive , I probably would have just said fuck movies . Here 's mine , not that anyone will see it buried down here . * Encounters at the End of the World : * Antarctic documentary . Beautifully raw yet haunting cinematography . Werner Herzog 's poetic narration is both moving and hilarious ; his humor is indistinguishable from his moments of sincerity ( if they even exist ) . * Clueless : * Smart , lighthearted comedy featuring naive teenage girls . Alicia Silverstone is a babe . * Yojimbo : * Western-influenced film about a wayward samurai who places himself in the middle of a conflict between a divided town and ends up orchestrating it . Beautifully shot and directed , very strong narrative , balanced mix of comedy , politics , action . * Dr. Strangelove : * Dark comedy dealing with international politics and the atomic bomb . Succinct , beautifully shot , funny , provoking , and ultimately incredibly satisfying . * Grave of the Fireflies : * Super depressing anime dealing with the horrors of war . I personally found it more effective than much more graphic war films .

1 With a dash of robocop . As someone who grew up in the 80s , I really enjoyed chappie .

1 Yeah , like that Daniel Day-Lewis guy . Jeez , what a * hack * .

1 Yeah , it 's just a bad angle . Look at her legs , she 's leaning her lower body against the bookcase ( in heels ! ) , but putting her chest forward . It makes her ribs protrude and her hips look kinda weird .

1 It is a wonderful movie that I almost can not watch again due to sadness .

1 Dude I cry when Gandalf dies , Gandalf charges with the Rohirrim at Helm 's Deep , Rohirrim at Minas Tirith and probably tear up at random moments in the films .

1 Should have given them free reign and just let it be R .

1 It made the movie better ... hard to explain why , but it felt the same as the first time I played my Xbox on HD .

1 I would only believe this if Tom Hanks said it .

1 a ) Because he 'd feel like a sell out b ) He had an iconic voice that was recognizable as a narrator .

1 Knew what it was gon na be , watched the whole thing anyway

1 I think the one arm gave it away that she was the kid .

1 I love this movie ! I also watched the tv show and movie called 'City of Men ' , it was a lot less violent and more coming of age for two teens in a favela .

1 check it out man , we almost started redditing on the same day

1 This is somewhat of a gripe a lot of people have about the movie , but in a nutshell he put him in the same pit he and Talia were in . The idea was that he wanted Bruce to break mentally as well as physically . The reason he did n't expect Bruce to escape was because he was physically incapacitated after their fight . What people are complaining about is two fold about this part in the film ; 1 ) Why did he put him there 2 ) How did Batman recover physically . In the first scenes you see him crippled but then receive a mechanical leg brace to increase his leg strength . But in the scenes where he was `` in prison '' he had no leg brace , and he suffered what appeared to be a spinal injury . Regardless if it time lapsed 5-6 months , it could be still be argued that it 's impossible to recover from that injury . 3 ) How did he get back to gotham After escaping , it appeared he was in a middle-eastern type setting . If I remember right I thought the comics based Bane out of South America but I could be mistaken . Regardless though , with Bruce having no money , no form of communications and no idea where he was at , getting back to Gotham in a matter of days that the movie suggests was near improbable .

1 If you have n't seen the original Bardock or Trunks Special , watch those . They 're both canon . After that , you can watch the newer Bardock Special , which is n't that great , but it 's pretty fun . As for the actual movies , the only ones I really liked were 12 and 13 , which had a pretty good balance of humor along with the action .

1 For the whole experience ? I know it 's the current circlejerk but millions of people will go and watch his films .

1 Why are n't more people aware of this ?

1 He needs them to survive the burning blade . Yin and Law are the first ones who have .

1 Did the audience stand up and give you a round of applause and the usher hand you a $ 100 bill ?

1 Without reading that livejournal entry I can tell you right now it 's because Rocky IV ended the motherfucking Cold War .

1 This was announced months ago .

1 Yeah the marketing for it sucked . It 's nothing like that . It 's Neeson 's best since Schindler 's List . And I say that as someone who loved Taken .

1 It 's fan made . Unintentional .

1 But do n't you kind of want to see what they do next ...

1 Is that the one where at the end he pulls himself together and emerges as a better person ? But seriously , I love Click .

1 Yeah , Zac is only making the movie if Tim and Eric do the script and the art decoration . I guess he really likes them .

1 Most Excellent .

1 Not really . The prequel Star Wars movie tried to appeal to literally every target audience George could think of . Podracing and Anakin for hte kids , but they also had political plots and CHILDREN GENOCIDE for the older fans . It was n't Disneyified it was Lucas 'd .

1 Assuming he does n't go the War Horse route with cliche quirky barn yard animals , and cringe worthy sentimentality .

1 You 're being unfairly downvoted by people who did n't get the joke http : / boingboing.net / 2010 / 03 / 30 / recaptioning-new-yor.html

1 Yes , please .

1 So , what you 're saying is that it 's * out there * . We always suspected as much .

1 pretty sure he did . bruckheimer is a producer of a Bunch of movies with eh character development and big explosions . what does a producer do you ask ? basically anything that happens in between different peoples roles , the producer makes those things happen .

1 Yes , I was trying to remember where I knew her from

1 His cabin and collection of old earth items was very much like Wall-E .

1 Uh the Conjuring was full of jump scares . In fact there were very few scares that were n't jump scares . Something happens suddenly + music buildup was quite normal in that movie .

1 Because it 's funny .

1 That was one of the few sex scenes that made sense to me . It showed the degradation of their relationship when compared to the first one .

1 thank mr skeletal

1 I liked the whole spy thing it has going .

1 When the OP said `` what does Reddit think about this list ? `` , it would be kind of difficult to give an opinion without actually making a comment about the relative positions of the films .

1 The Madness of King George . Also , check out the documentary and nature sections .

1 Now then , do n't undersell New Zealand 's fourth most popular guitar-based digi-bongo acappella-rap-funk-comedy folk duo .

1 I love rocky IV . I and II were genuinely good movies , III knew it was starting to overstay its welcome , and IV said `` fuck it , let 's have him fight communism itself '' . They built the series up and they rode it wonderfully on the way down . Think of it like a bunch of friends swapping stories . I is good but small , gets the room going . II sees the opening and tells a longer story now that everyone is interested . III tries to one up II but actually has something good to say , we would all be kind of annoyed but the story was good and we allow it . IV sees that the room is kind of done with this conversation so he tells a joke to finish it off . V sees everyone laughing and wants to look cool , so he tries to one up everyone with a sadly embellished story about how he totally won that bar fight . The room just kind of looks at him awkwardly and we try not to mention it .

1 It 's for art class , so it 's not a waste of time . Putting it up on reddit was n't the original point of this .

1 FUCK

1 Did you * only * see the movie ? That 's the only way you could have come to that conclusion .

1 > Don Quixote I have seen at least three Don Quijote-flicks - The Orson Welles version being the most memorable .

1 not true

1 The comment is pretty extreme , sure . HBO needs to be able to work with netflix . If they do n't allow netflix to carry their shows then people are just going to pirate them and HBO wo n't get shit . netflix is simply the way to go if you want your content to be seen these days . I sure as hell wo n't pay for those extra cable stations when most of the stuff they show is utter shit . It is stupid to pay all that money and only watch a few things a month . Netflix is perfect for your average person , buying extra channels for ridiculous prices is n't .

1 Honestly I think the guy who played him in David Lynch 's version was perfect . Everything else was ... questionable .

1 I 've seen enough hentai ... ..

1 The article says he 's meant to be 10 in the movie , so hopefully that means Card stuck to his guns on that point . This movie has swirled around the outskirts of actually being made for so long , it would be a shame if they had finally started compromising on important aspects of the story .

1 Exactly . `` Why is he wearing make-up in every shot ? What happened to all those tattoos ? ''

1 That 's not arguable ... that 's literally the entire point of Ender 's Game .

1 Me either , unless OP is interpreting it as a ( pretty weak , IMO ) sexual innuendo .

1 I know right ! ! ! You turned water into wine , smite them ! ! ! .

1 Because it was old-school Bond .

1 Yes , it is , in fact , not good . Also , I do n't think it 's a bad movie either . I think it 's okay , it 's fine for what it is . That 's it . Nothing more , nothing less .

1 I like Bradley Cooper as The Flash .

1 Skeletor - Masters of the Universe Ming the Merciless - Flash Gordon The Thing - The Thing Benedict - Last Action Hero Lucifer - The Devil 's Advocate

1 Give the man a prize !

1 also alzheimer 's , als , and suicide awareness .

1 Mister VicePresidente , you do n't have to hide it anymore . Wikileaks has announced it everywhere ...

1 My god , that would be ... .no words .

1 Hey as long as Scotty does n't know

1 There 's a fair amount of theorising and discussion about Prometheus going on in /r/LV426 right now , so you can join in there , but yeah , I agree with you to an extent . I 'm liking the theory that [ humans were created to serve as incubators for their bioweapon , to be used against other Engineers ] ( / spoiler ) , which would explain why [ the Engineers were headed to Earth ] ( / spoiler ) . There 's also some speculation that [ each vase did not contain an identical type of the black goo ] ( / spoiler ) . Also , do n't forget that the [ decapitated Engineer appeared to have been infected with the goo , and when they brought him back to life , his head exploded ] ( / spoiler ) . Do n't you think , coupled with the opening of the film , that it suggests [ Engineers ca n't survive as hosts of the black goo ] ( / spoiler ) ? The scene at the end is different because [ the Engineer was n't infected with the goo directly , but face-humped by a creature that came out of Elizabeth ] ( / spoiler ) . That would back up the theory that [ humans were specifically designed to be incubators of the goo , made in the Engineers ' image to be as powerful as possible , but with goo-compatibility ] ( / spoiler ) . It 's early days for theories , but that might work .

1 He revolutionised film as well as making good films in terms of psychological realism and the representation of sexuality .

1 I had fun watching it . It was n't as good as Pitch Black , but it was much better than Chronicles l think . The Riddick series is n't the greatest franchise in terms of overall plot , but they 're fun to watch like I said . You can tell Vin Diesel really loves the character and universe though . I read somewhere he mortgaged his own home to help pay for the production , and did a cameo in Tokyo Drift for the rights to the IP . You got ta respect that level of passion .

1 > ~~HAHAHAHAH ! ~~ Ha-ha-ha-ha-harrrr-haharrr-hrrr-hhh . ftfy

1 Same here . Did you read that he is a local of Snowtown and they literally just found him in the mall ? ? And most of the actors are locals with no experience . I 'm just amazed how well they all did .

1 Then thus the fall of the Republic is prevented . And all rejoice . ( Yay ! )

1 CHRIST . I GET IT OKAY ! ! ! * runs away screaming *

1 So ... CSB time . I was scanning through Netflix a couple of weeks ago and `` Cagliostro '' came up on my recommends . I had n't ever seen it before , despite having seen most of Miyazaki 's other works . Start watching it , and this car chase scene comes on . Suddenly ... memories . `` I 've seen this before . '' I know what 's coming : `` he 's going to drive up on the side of that cliff . '' Yup , sure enough he does . But here 's the weird thing : in my memories , there 's no sound . Except for one : `` ding . '' An electronic ... ding . The hell ? So we keep watching the movie , but in the back of my mind I 'm still puzzling over this . After the car chase scene everything there 's no longer that feeling of familiarity : everything is new . Also , no more dings . Finally , about 2 / 3 of the way into the movie it hits me like a ton of bricks : a video game ! There was a video game I played when I was a kid that used scenes from this ! So I break out the Googles and ... v ? ila : [ Cliff Hanger ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Cliff_Hanger_\ ( video_game\ ) ) . I had n't played that since I was 12 years old , some 30 years ago . Could not believe it .

1 Those were great .

1 * But we need him more . *

1 That 's not true at all . She 's complaining about how the title was handled by the shitty market team that clearly goes on reddit and saw these jackasses literally make a huge deal about the title out of nothing , so they thought changing it would appeal to this small but loud and seemingly large subset of reddit that actually cared about the title , when only a very very small subset of THAT subset actually seriously cared . The article you linked of Emily Blunt badmouthing the title is taken insanely out of context . She did not badmouth Edge of Tomorrow , she badmouthed the idiotic reddit-frequenting WB marketing team for changing it . And she 's only saying her personal preference of a title BECAUSE of the fact that there IS a title conflict , even though there should n't be . She likes `` Edge of Tomorrow . ''

1 It did with me . That shit was awesome .

1 Ebert gave Knowing 4 shiny stars ! How dare you go against a Ebert 's 4-stars ? Just because it was a pretentious and a terribly paced disaster movie ?

1 oh wow yeah i remember seeing this in theaters and it was all i could think about . that imax sound system made the roar insane .

1 It 's more so that every single time a new one appears , which feels like it 's daily , they go straight to the top of the subreddit with the rest of them . Personally , while i 'm looking forward to Iron Man 3 , i 'd rather discuss different films that come out each week . I saw Snitch and there was n't even a single discussion about it on this subreddit . Though , this one is much better than the ones featuring War Machine and Pepper because it actually introduces something new into the discussion .

1 The movies are based of several interlocking stories , the first movie only did some of them . It 's all from a comic book series .

1 Alpha Flight rules and any true fan knows this

1 wish there was a sequel to this , i liked the movie : (

1 HELL YES

1 He was impressed by the captains performance .

1 Ratings = / = box office gross

1 I have no excuse . as a robot camera myself , that scene gave me a profound appreciation for SteadyCam . When i see this scene , i 'm basically Keanu Reeves saying `` whoa . ''

1 Amelie is a beautiful movie , goddammit .

1 To be fair , all the interviews are kind of the same . They ask the same questions all the time . It 's widely known that the whole interview process sucks for everyone around , but it 's part of the job .

1 You know that batman fighting superman is n't going to be as simple as punching each other ... Superman is n't going to kill batman . Batman is n't going into a one on one fist fight . And the film might be called vs , but by the end they will become best friends called the world finest .

1 The sequel is happening .

1 The Futurama movies Session 9

1 You were clearly derriding the creators of the film for choosing to make a zombie film by implying , through sarcasm , that the films are too common and they are being unoriginal . Likewise , I was implying through sarcasm that it is perfectly okay for people to make zombie films , irrespective of how common they are , and that you are wrong to criticize them for it . New zombie films are released occasionally that are really good , so who cares how common they are ? If they do n't appeal to you , no one is forcing you to watch them , and it 's not like you do n't know if a film is a zombie film going into it .

1 Correct . But by the time they were created it had been established that the lords of the sith had meaning behind their names .

1 Yeah , I basically gave up trying to understand what they were saying after losing my eardrums for the third time

1 I demand Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League !

1 We know what it looks like from the [ action figure ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / wSTMD.jpg ) and [ spin-off manga ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / gvjLY.jpg ) . ( [ More info on the manga ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Cloverfield / Kishin ) ) .

1 We 've all seen those things too though .

1 Do you want Ant-Man ? Because that 's how you get Ant-Man !

1 Never would have thought of that one .

1 now get your head outta your ass and the read the rest because that was a fantastic review .

1 spoilers yo

1 Oh but it * does * . Check put the 21st century link someone else posted above . Personally , I do not understand why this animation makes it above Nemo or any Miyazaki film .

1 The Yuppies we have now are worse than ever ... there just are n't as many of them ...

1 > bunch of letters WTF ? You 've never heard of them ? It seems like just days ago that /r/movies was circlejerking about ERWTYURE AROUT 's 'method acting ' .

1 There 's no such thing as a shit comedy !

1 He spends a lot of his time with scale doubles of the dwarves . The dwarves are all about 6 ' when they 're in their prosthetics , which means they 're actually taller than Gandalf . They 've got two 7 ' doubles who play Gandalf and other human sized characters for the full sized dwarves . The scale doubles of the dwarves are just under 5 ' and look almost identical . I spent two days on set with them all and it was unbelievable . Much of Rivendell is actually a beautifully crafted polystyrene set . It looks absolutely real when you 're there ( if you ignore the green screen ) . If you have n't seen them already , the production diaries have been uploaded to Youtube and are well worth watching . The weirdest moment on set was lunch on the second day . To my left were two of the Gandalf doubles , to my right were many of the dwarven doubles . 7 ' to my left , 5 ' and under to my right . Me , 6 ' in the middle . Add to that the elves , who were all models and my height , and I 've never felt so average in my entire life .

1 Its an echo of Luke talking . If you listen closely , its speaking the same words he is .

1 Did the same and as I 'm 2 / 3 of the way through it ... this is going to be awesome . He does `` Los Angeles-ness '' so great , and the book is chock full of that stuff .

1 I was going to make this comment if someone else had n't . Great books , douchebag author .

1 Just like Eddie , he 's getting rich all the way down .

1 He was awesome in Seabiscuit and Cider House Rules

1 I think the Coen brothers are the only people capable of really making a Blood Meridian adaption work . They handled No Country so incredibly well , as well as violence in general . I would love to see this happen .

1 Source ?

1 It has been twenty years since the first film .

1 The villain ? You mean Iron Man ? I doubt he 's going to suck .

1 Problem is , some of the jokes are innies and some are outties . Calling them them * all * you favorite in-joke will only make you look da fool .

1 I had just put laundry in in my basement when I started the movie . It did not see the drier til the next day .

1 That 's really specific .

1 Did n't Routh play WoW as well ? He did n't look bad .

1 > You know what to do . No I do n't .

1 You keep using that word . I do not think it means what you think it means .

1 Fletch ! : D

1 Nothing too bad during the film , you do n't see innocent civilians getting killed or anything . Violence is limited to henchmen being thrown in the air and heavy punches being landed between various parties . Perhaps 10+ just so they get their head around the plot and some dialogue .

1 dude did you see these last playoffs ? he ca n't finish ? take that weak , ignorant shit to /r/NBA and see what kinda response and consensus you get outta that , fool .

1 Aside from using CGI , I thought they did quite a good job making sure they got all of the points to meld with The Thing .

1 > There not `` issues '' . There realistic . It 's realistic to have orchestral accompaniment drown out your everyday speech ?

1 It 's definitely peculiar but I 'm not seeing the issue ( s ) you are . Try it in a different browser .

1 But lens flares mostly come out at night ... mostly .

1 Yeah and he looked very out of place .

1 I 'm guessing doing a Bond movie title song is on Alex Turner 's Bucket List and I hope he gets to do it . He could pull it off perfectly .

1 I 'll second 2007 : There Will Be Blood , 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days , No Country For Old Men , Michael Clayton , Into the Wild , Juno , Eastern Promises , The Diving Bell and Butterfly , Ratatouille , Hot Fuzz , Sunshine , etc .

1 You 're trying too hard .

1 I really liked that movie . The storytelling was n't anything special , but Denzel owned that whole movie . I believed him every step of the way .

1 `` What year ? '' `` * Every * year . ''

1 There 's no book the guy just got mixed up .

1 Yeah , I really did n't like the second book , so I 'm hoping that they change up the movie quite a bit from it .

1 oh yeah and I guess that Kazaam movie as well : - )

1 * Thank You *

1 so you 're saying it 's a documentary then . Got it .

1 They both made 1 good Iron Man . Let 's just call it even .

1 > you could tell he was truly touched . I 'd assume this is partly due to his history as primarily a genre actor . I would n't find it hard to believe that some 'proper ' dramatic actors have n't looked too kindly upon a guy who 's spent most of his life in horror films , B-movies and the occasional villain with very few major dramatic roles . To receive vindication and acknowledgement like this obviously means a huge amount to him .

1 ... to bow down

1 The Producers 2 : The Interview-ing

1 Face Off

1 Andrew Garfield was very good . I was impressed . I 'm just happy they did n't go the emo `` Oooo I 'm a nerd and no girl likes me '' Peter Parker route . And instead had Gwen and Peter kind of hit it off from the start .

1 This is at least the 12th post here today saying the same thing . You did n't see the others , that 's fine , just letting you know . The takeaway from the other threads : Trailers are marketing tools , they exist to sell tickets * not * to make your experience of the movie better . Trailers are not for people who want to see the movie , they are for the people who do n't or are on the fence . The strategy works , look at how successful a lot of these movies with spoilerific trailers are . It is not a new strategy , it has been a major part of trailers for decades . If you do n't want a movie you are excited to see spoiled for you , do n't watch the trailer for it . If you want the practice of spoilerific trailers abolished , vote with your wallet and do n't see movies the marketing of which included spoilerific trailers .

1 Probably the same reason why Voltron is n't there either .

1 I have trouble believing that they would have planned for the Orc to just miss Aragorn with his knife .

1 It 's DC , but Russell Crowe played a supporting character and he 's still pretty big

1 What part of Hemingway 's intent do you find `` whack '' and why ? He does write about hunting and fishing and bullfighting and war and boxing , but to say that those things are meaningless carries it 's own sense of sexism . He wrote about courage , valor , kindness , meaning , love , sacrifice , and many other virtues . And all that in light of death with no hope of any eternal reward . In fact , in spite of death . I do n't think it has to be a choice between Joyce or Hemingway . It can be both . But to dismiss him because you think he is somehow too `` manly '' seems to dismiss much of his intent and fails to see anything about what Hemingway is saying about the human condition .

1 thats why i always loved that scene in pineapple express when james franco kicks the windshield and his foot gets stuck in the hole . just the greatest satirical scene about how glass works in films .

1 They 're moving in herds ? they really do move in herds .

1 I do n't know I feel like his reputation has really deflated as of lately ...

1 Now that 's a list I would like to see . Aliens would probably be number one , most accurate depiction of Space Marines I 've ever seen .

1 With the Rifftrax going , this movie is hilarious .

1 I laughed a great deal at this . What have you done to poor , simple , pzPat ! ? !

1 That 's like , only like their opinion , man .

1 I 'm gon na go ahead and assume you have a pathetic deficiency in military history and knowledge .

1 I forgot about this movie . One of two movies that made me `` feel '' something die inside me emotionally . The other being Requiem for a Dream

1 In the long term this is a pretty minor technical hurdle . Making projected images brighter is n't exactly rocket science .

1 I mean , they are extremely well known online .

1 On Reddit , Dredd is extremely well known but I constantly keep hearing people tell me to watch . I was just saying they are similar movies .

1 It 's pretty disturbing . One of those movies that I appreciate artistically but do n't know if I really enjoyed watching it .

1 I just did !

1 They probably should 've just spent that money on writing a better movie .

1 He 's amazing in that film . Him and Ezra Miller made that film for me .

1 I do n't think I understand your reply . > It 's not funny when it means to be and funny when it tries to be serious . So you like it because it does n't do what it intends to do ? Is n't that the same as how The Room is liked ? > I do like Daniel Craig as bond , though . He 's too old for the part . So you like him because he 's too old or is this a `` however '' ? > Bond was still trying to regain it 's footing after Moonraker . So it sounds to me like you answered with your * least * favorite Bond movie , but the question asked for the favorite .

1 It 's not lying , it 's acting !

I always cry at the end ( after I 've had my Christmas Eve beers of course ) when Clarence leaves him the message , `` Remember , no man is a failure who has FRIENDS '' Puts shit into perspective , especially as a recent college graduate struggling to find a job .

1 I loved that whole movie , especially the sequence when they get a shot of the wall behind him . It 's completely covered with arrows except for an empty spot where he was standing . Then even after he is revealed to be a traitor , he gets a hero 's burial . I loved that movie 8 years ago and I love it today .

1 I love * Kill Bill * ! I just have n't been able to get the screenplays yet .

1 Just realized I 've never once thought of there being a sequel to either of those movies . It 's a rather ridiculous question , but good to hear their integrity come through in answering it .

1 Lord Bolton as a corporate executive .

1 Or commonly known as the fedora hat advertisement movie

1 So damn generic , and way too similar to `` A New Hope '' but maybe that is the point .

1 Probably because most people need to watch it 10 times before understanding wtf is going on

1 That 's more the writers / studios fault . Jackman is good as the character but they do n't seem to nail the solo movies . The Wolverine almost did so they 're going to the right direction .

1 Man , I 've * loved * SFS since the beginning . I think it 's criminally underappreciated . SFS has the best character moments and really treats the crew like family . It 's a very personal film , where the focus is on the crew and not a sci-fi concept , even though that 's what brings Spock back . But Kirk is his most Kirk-like in SFS . His lines that really stood out were `` I had to try '' to the Admiral in spacedock , and `` The word is no . We are therefore going anyway '' , and of course the end to Sarek `` if I had n't tried , the cost would have been my soul '' . TWOK had Kirk as a reactionary figure , dealing with what was thrust upon him . SFS had Kirk as the driving force behind the action . I love both films , and TWOK is definitely a superior film . But TWOK is the main course steak dinner , while SFS is the delicious dessert that follows - lighter , fluffier , but thoroughly enjoyable , if not as filling . In SFS , everything with the classic cast is just pure gold . Christopher Lloyd is not the most threatening of Klingons , and every other Klingon fails to measure up to him ( John Laroquette 's `` I do not deserve to live '' is almost emotionless and very unKlingonlike ) . And Robin Curtis as the expository diologue machine was pretty yawn-inducing . I think if the other parts of SFS outside the main crew had been better , SFS would be held in higher regard .

1 Came here to mention traitor , pretty good movie

1 * spoilers * First of all , not all of the Nazis are one-demensional bad guys ( see Max 's father , Colonel Hans ' sparing Shosanna 's life , probably more than once ) and Aldo Raine is n't a one-demensinal good guy ( he sticks his finger in Bridget von Hammersmark 's wound even though the audience is perfectly aware of her innocence . Now , I know Aldo did n't know , but if Tarantino wanted this movie about Great Americans killing the Evil Nazis , this probably would n't have been in the film ) . I know Tarantino wanted to make a badass action film . But his films are n't simple . Many - if not most - of his films have non-liniar plotlines . Why ca n't a badass action film challenge the viewer 's views on the notion of one-sided evil ? And tell me , what makes us watching `` Basterds '' * that * much different than Nazis watching American soldiers get shot down ? If you say it 's because Nazis are inherently less humane , than [ you 're wrong ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Milgram_experiment ) . And why did he show a film about Nazis shooting American 's as opposed to , say , propaganda about the master race ?

1 [ How Lebron feels about your stance on sports , and pretty much this entire thread . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / hyvPa.gif )

1 Hahaha that 's hilarious . That 's one of those things where other people will come through and be like `` wow I wonder why there 's a big hole right there '' and nobody will ever know the story .

1 He was brilliant in A Beautiful Mind and Master and Commander .

1 I 'd say I was pleased more with Channing Tatum . I was surprised he was very funny , and the chemistry the two of them had just made it better .

1 How ? Everything was explained in the movie pretty clearly .

1 Shoulda been Buzz Lightyear ! C'mon , it 's a no-brainer

1 You should write screenplays .

1 Super 8 ?

1 I think its simply a type of curse that presents itself in the form of a person . The curse is passed along and you know how it goes . It 's kind of metaphorical of STD 's in a funny way but I thought the movie was great !

1 `` ... dude ... ''

1 I say absolutely , i knew the ending when I watched it , but it 's still an amazingly well made , incredibly well acted , and immensely enjoyable film one of my favorites , even having seen it knowing the twist

1 Looks like i got 2 minutes for high ... sticking !

1 Punch Drunk Love ?

1 Yes ! I know very few people ( under the age of 40 ) who have seen , and appreciate , this . And that seriously bums me out . It 's a `` classic '' for a reason .

1 exactly what i was thinking . maybe one day he 'll get a nomination for writing , but i 'm not holding my breath .

1 I can really hear his style in both POI 's scoring and the Main theme for Pacific Rim . Both seem to have very similar qualities . I 'm glad this guy is getting recognized more .

1 this guy

1 And the f * cking music ... the ending sequence gives me goosebumps .

1 I agree on this one , due to the fact that I knew almost nothing about the movie aside from that one initial trailer . The movie ended being one of the better movies I 've seen this year . Also makes for a great Star Wars film . Lol

1 Seems clear from the MoS movie that these same questions will play a heavy part in the next one .

1 Justin Bieber ?

1 i do like the short but i meant the opening scene with bill murray in the taxi and the slow motion train scene with the kinks playing in the background

1 Hott fuzz

1 Too good .

1 wot ?

1 > He was n't telling her to never let go of his hand . which he pointed out in his own post

1 He was uncredited though . Nolan specifically said he was excited about people not knowing he was in the movie .

1 Do n't judge the global movie opinion based on the opinions you see on /r/movies . If you ask me , the Marvel Cinematic Universe is probably the most popular thing in the movie industry at the moment so I do n't think there 's much of a backlash against that . I mean , you 'll always have some people hating it but the majority of moviegoers seem to enjoy the hell out of it . Pacific Rim has gotten more love than hate even on this sub but it 's got its naysayers . I personally was n't impressed with it but I do n't demean people who loved it . We all have different tastes and , if anything , Pacific Rim did a great job of being an entertaining popcorn flick with tons of action .

1 That is true . It 's on hour long .

1 In case I do n't see ya ! Good afternoon , good evening , and goodnight . * bows *

1 Really ? I thought everyone raved his performance and one of the reason he got so popular

1 Nothing reported supports that . This woman left because she would n't sign a non-disclosure agreement and did n't approve of them installing security cameras to protect Quentin Tarantino 's movie theater . It was n't because they 're raising prices , it 's because she got mad when they told her not to leak everything onto Twitter and Instagram .

1 `` Would you mind getting * inside * the oven to clean it ? '' If that 's not a line out of scary movie I do n't know what is .

1 Just get the fuck out .

1 Snowpiercer .

1 When she crawls out and just as she stands up she kind of teleports a bit ! Freaked me out so much as a kid !

1 If memory serves you played as Jango Fett in that game .

1 They 're not canon .

1 If you are interested there is a book called John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood which is all about the terrible marketing of that movie .

1 I was going to question your source . But that `` I do n't get out much '' put my mind at ease .

1 The films marketing was god awful . Trying to persuade my girlfriend to see it she refuses on grounds that it 's a movie for young teens , like a boys version of the hunger games . To be honest , I do n't blame her , the trailers gave that overwhelming impression . But in all honesty the film is pure fun . Like Pacific Rim , it 's a genre movie in love with its own genre . It 's a love letter to Bond films of old . I admit it harped on the `` were n't things better when they were fun and dapper ? '' a bit much , but it 's a well rounded film with fun characters , great action , and good humour . It 's a pity the marketing was so botched .

1 Xavier is probably one of the most powerful mutants in the world , but he 's also very moral and wants people to do things from their own free will . If he wanted to , he could make himself president of the world and make everyone follow him . That 's just not who he is . In fact , he did his best to save Trask 's life , rather than allow harm to come to him ( because it was already too late , and Trask had been apparently pushing for the sentinal program for a long time after the Cuban crisis in First Class ) . Secondly , Logan in DOFP ( 70s ) does n't remember anything , only the `` present day '' Logan does . When the connection starts stuttering , Logan in the 70s `` wakes up '' in the White House and has no clue what 's going on , but when `` present day Logan '' comes back , he remembers everything . Does that make sense to you ?

1 There 's no adventure here ...

1 I agree with this , militant government created a program to find and develop psychic children . Akira was the most powerful of the original 4 , but for reasons unknown he caused some shit and had to be locked away , well what was left at least

1 ^Dan ^becomes ^a ^man

1 that scene in Take Shelter where he 's screaming at the townsfolk is incredibly powerful . What an actor .

1 Did you notice how almost all the shots are perfectly symmetrical ?

1 * Get your fokkin ' tentacle out of my face ! *

1 Because he 's Groovy .

1 Wow thank you for this ! I am ridiculously interested in this . I 've been addicted to box office numbers for years .

1 im sorry that the next big DC superhero summer flick is n't Citizen Kane

1 to be fair , what a great decision not to do X-3

1 Should be named Free_Headaches or Free_Seizures .

1 Cleopatra . It 's also one of the most expensive movies of all time ( adjusted for inflation ) , which , as far as I 'm concerned , spent a lot of time in production hell .

1 He deserves props for pursuing such a thing , but the actual geniuses are the stunt coordinators / practical effects coordinators and the team behind these things

1 It 's a movie called A Serbian Film http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / A_Serbian_Film

1 I 'm really interested in hearing what you did n't like about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind .

1 Especially when they 're working for an intelligence agency . You should n't take their word for it , but you also should n't dismiss the possibility just because someone wrote a speculative article on wired.com .

1 Upvote for balls

1 He 's actually much closer to 6 ' 0 '' . http : / www.celebheights.com / s / Arnold-Schwarzenegger-177.html 6'2 '' according to imdb : http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0000216 / bio

1 Dalton 's birth is disputed ? That 's the sign of a true Timelord .

1 And I believe I saw Pictionary in the Dunne house . It was under the night stand next to the overturned furniture . idk..

1 I thought of Morpheus too . Specifically , the scene in the Revolutions where they raid the hell club . Trinity and ... the Oracle 's bodyguard were doing badass martial arts and Morpheus just stood there spamming bullets with his duel submachine guns . Also , they added that lame love triangle in Reloaded .

1 Actually , the transfer is pretty damn bad .

1 i could see R2D2 being more than what it seems . the point being that he presumidly never gets a memory wipe where as C-3P0 gets one every 2 days or so .

1 I agree . The only one who really questioned it was his ex

1 Yeah , fans were predicting this ever since she was casted . Those pics pretty much seal the deal .

1 It speaks to the relatively cheap nature of simple composites in film these days . It 's actually cheaper to create a virtual river than to location scout and move your production there . And cheaper even than renting a private jet , especially if you 're only going to use it for one or two shots in your film .

1 yeah its always been there , granted sometimes they detour the ... tour and you go around it , but you can always see it . Also there is a video playing in the tram that explains what it is . Source : Someone with a pass that goes 3-4 times a month .

1 I do n't think that 's what this thread is about

1 He was n't profiteering off the slave culture . He was making his profit off the `` old west '' culture , hunting down murderers and stagecoach robbers for their bounties . He did force the slave trade to work for him , as he explained to Django in the bar , but all in all he was n't profiting from the slave trade at all .

1 Oh it definitely describes the movie but I do n't think that makes it a good title . It just seems lazy and I think they could have put a little more thought into it .

1 So are generalizations .

1 Yeah Gyllenhall was fantastic in this movie . I agree he should definitely be looked at for an Oscar for his performance .

1 OKLAHOMA ! OKLAHOMA ! OKLAHOMA ! OKLAHOMA !

1 No , I know the shooting style , but I 'm just saying , if you look at the shots , they 're really not all that up close and shaky . And certainly not the whole movie . I mean , there 's plenty of use of it , but ... I mean just watch the movie there are great medium and long shots , the movie is by no means completely from hush puppy 's perspective . I mean ... Just watch it . Just look at the shots right ?

1 What you did there , I see it .

1 If you set the bar low enough , everything is awesome .

1 Also , you 're guaranteed somebody to talk about it with afterwards .

1 No , he is underrated .

1 Captain Phillips looks really , really good . I like movies based on true events and since Greengrass did a good job with United 93 I 'm eager to see his new film .

1 It was n't ever really underground , but the film was widely expected to flop at the box office prior to release .

1 I thought I was the only person on the planet who fucking loved the Speed Racer movie

1 How is that a `` remake '' or `` reboot '' ? That 's a straight-up sequel .

1 * PaPWAAAAAK ! PaPWAAAAAK ! * * Shriek *

1 imo his best performance .

1 This has been been my favorite movie / franchise since childhood . You 've just changed the entire way I 've experienced it . Well done !

1 And a chicken in every pot

1 Did you ask if it was appropriate that Un 's father was portrayed in Team America ?

1 Academy Awards . Personally , I 'd rather have an award that 's been voted upon by my peers .

1 While I agree with you to some point , let 's not pretend that Birdman does n't appeal to the Academy because it 's about acting and the actors ' lives when a lot of Academy members are actors . It touches on a lot of topics sure but I do n't think it won solely because of that but I think it contributed a little bit . I think it was one of the four movies I would n't have minded seeing win best picture even though I did n't love it as much as OP ( the other 3 being Boyhood , Grand Budapest , and Whiplash ) .

1 For Your Eyes Only is great , i would probably rank it number 2 for Moore behind TSWLM

1 I liked it too . Although it 's the least exciting of the movies , it will make the series as a whole stronger for the amount of world building it accomplishes . It really raises the stakes / fleshes out the oppression of the capital and how much the districts are willing to sacrifice to be free .

1 I loved it . It was Borat but with a stronger bite . The scene where he tells the parents of babies that he needs them to lose some weight to get the modeling job was one of the greatest in the past 10 years .

1 Boy , I got ta Getaway from all these corporate shills .

1 Aside from a simple story , Splinter and April , it was a pretty good movie . Turtles , humor and action were spot on . Definitely worth watching if you 're a turtle fan . Totally does n't deserve the hate and low ratings .

1 [ This ] ( http : / www.celebritynetworth.com / articles / celebrity / how-did-nicolas-cage-blow-through-an-150-million-dollar-fortune / ) sums it up in a short way . The taxes were what really screwed him . Most of his spending was in solid assets that could have been considered investments that could have appreciated in value over time . Unfortunately , he took a massive loss on most of them . That was when he started taking every role offered to him , regardless of how shitty some of them were .

1 Yeah , we just have n't done it because the movies are already so convincing .

1 The Power Rangers movie . With Ivan Ooze as the bad guy .

1 Yeah ! The Miike version has a few different names . [ Here ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt1728196 / ) is the IMDB site . It is being released this month in the states .

1 He has a very jarring style that can be a bit oppressive . And honestly , I would n't really expect people to love all his films . But there are certainly scenes in his movies where I feel like anyone can enjoy if they 're willing to look from an objective point of view . Most famously , the Hans Landra interrogation scene or even his back and forth with Brad Pitt in the 3rd act are quite enjoyable .

1 Guess what man , different people have different heroes . My heroes certainly are n't perfect but that does n't make them any less important to me

1 Actially , yes . It helps with the whole Leti storyline .

1 Midnight In Paris

1 And he 's about to be in Fargo season 2 as Ronald Reagan . Mmmmm .

1 Maybe this bland look is the point ? It 's from sherlocks perspective , and he presents his story in a sober way ( due to his down-to earth and rather unemotional personality ) unlike watson who recorded their cases in an engaging , adventure-like manner while often mystifiying mr holmes

1 I see what you did there

1 It was clearly not the same character..

1 No . You are responsible for his hardware . They spent hundreds of dollars on an iPad so they can tell you it 's an iPad . -sent from my iPhone

1 Hey man , it 's a bullshit attitude to say we do n't care about spoilers . Maybe you do n't , but you need to stop assuming that applies to rest of us .

1 tooth decay is largely a product of agrarian diets , so on that account the film may be ( accidentally ) closer to the truth

1 It is a complete bastardization . The original series had a real sense of dread and terror in every episode . This instead is like That 70 's Show meets The Munsters .

1 There 's like am extra half hour or something in the directors cut , there is an entire lawyer / case subplot with coolio that does n't exist in the theatrical release and at one point in the movie something directly opposite happens that was nonsensical in the original . It 's not a fantastic movie , but the difference between the two is pretty huge .

1 Who were the first link in finding out who 'd stolen the blueprints to their ultimate weapon / space station . If some lovely old couple in Afghanistan were linked to the theft of blueprints to aircraft carrier / rail gun / stealth bomber , you can put money on them being visited by Blackwater .

1 A Bat CreditCard ! ?

1 Haha , we had a technical glitch but our good friends at Reddit just fixed it : ) Most people do the following- It 's all about marketing yourself . Put together a demo Reel of your voice , and target it to specific agencies that your voice would be appropriate for . But another more interesting way would be to do an actual inexpensive animated short film , where you do all the voice overs of every character , to show the range of your talents . And then submit that , to the proper entities

1 This movie is phenomenal . Tragic that it 's so under appreciated and most people do n't even know it exists .

1 I was wondering ... did all those people in Germany speak English ?

1 He 's too old .

1 I think the best part of this movie is them eating lunch in the hotel . Only Aaron is framed in the mirror so you can see both sides of his head - revealing he 's not wearing an earpiece . It 's something nobody can appreciate until they re-watch the movie enough to be looking for the earpiece , and it shows the depth that Carruth went into planning the film .

1 Nic Cage for Face / Off should have just been a picture of John Travolta .

1 Fentanyl cut heroin has been showing up on the east coast . I kid you not , these articles were published just a days ago . Fentanyl is 10 to 100x more stronger than morphine .

1 That would be one hell of a GLASS CASE OF EMOTION .

1 It was so cute , like `` Groot do good ? '' haha

1 Not only that , but apparently his accent in the Prestige was meant to be an upper-class type Brit which sounded similar to an American .

1 Yes . Yes you are .

1 I agree but the first one is the best in my opinion hands down .

1 The problem with giving you a link is that the scene is absolutely awe-inspiring within the context of the movie , but if you watch it out-of-context , it 'll still be interesting for the technical side but you 'll miss out on the * feel * of it and why it 's so amazing . Basically , humanity has gone sterile and the youngest person in the world is already well into his teens . In this scene , the main characters carry a baby through a warzone and everyone on all sides stops fighting just while the baby passes . And somehow , just seeing a baby that we the audience have seen for an entire movie is enough to drive us speechless . I recommend just renting the movie . It 's all amazing .

1 I liked the first blade movie . But they spent a great deal of time establishing that a biological agent ( a virus ) is behind the existence of vampires , then introduced a supernatural element ( La Magra ) with little explanation .

1 Try Full Metal Jacket .

1 I think we in america generally agree that as long as the letter 'h ' is pronounced as a consonant , it shall be treated as such . Silent 'h ' sounds require an 'an ' , but if you can hear the 'h ' and not whatever letter comes after it , you use an 'a ' .

1 Now this is just my reading of the actual novel ( really not a fan of the movie ) , but I think Heinlein 's point was n't that we need a fascist society as depicted , his point was how those sorts of societies can be become appealing . You get caught up in the camaraderie and the 'brotherhood ' , you read Dubois lectures and it starts to click for you , and then suddenly you find yourself agreeing with a fascist militaristic state . The book is utterly brilliant in that it 's essentially artificial propaganda for a regime that does n't exist .

1 Latino Review has gotten information wrong regularly ( on films I 've worked on ) , yet somehow maintains an audience , is my only issue . Also , it sounds like a website dedicated to 'hot or not ' style ratings of Latinos .

1 Same for after childbirth .

1 The Dirty Dozen . Saving Private Ryan . Band of Brothers is a tv series bit awesome as well .

1 I loved it I enjoyed jakes performance of a societal outcast who had no care for anymore but himself

1 That editing was just silly but as soon as I saw the first pods I pooped my pants a little . Then a lot .

1 What an original thought ...

1 lol wait thats who his character is replacing ... .

1 The score to this movie is great .

1 OP bent time and space to attend this gala ! Or they got an invite .

1 Clone Wars is canon .

1 I love Edward Norton , but Mark Ruffalo was pitch perfect as Bruce Banner , not to mention his performance capture as the Hulk . I 'm glad they signed Ruffalo on a multi-film contract to play the character . I hope to see more scenes with him and Tony Stark , the two geniuses of the Avengers .

1 And the Ginger Snaps series is Canadian . Great alternate look at werewolves .

1 I think I read somewhere tha this was one of the only male-friendships that does n't end somewhere during the movie to add drama , like the break-up in a romantic comedy halfway through .

1 http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Category : Mountaineering_films

1 It does .

1 Technically , it 's neither a sequel nor a prequel since none of the same characters exist from movie to movie . The protagonist is essentially the same in each , but he 's never actually identified as the same person . This is arguable by some , since he does pick up the poncho at the end of GBU , but I contend that was simply a nod and a wink to the other character , or rather perhaps simply to the poncho , and not actually an effort to tie the films together . The three films only started being called a trilogy and the protagonist only became `` The Man with No Name '' as a marketing ploy to sell the movies as a packaged deal to American audiences years after the films had been made .

1 My favorite part of my favorite film ! His delivery is just pitch perfect .

1 I wouldnt say the movies have ruined my childhood ... but cause extreme disappointment , yes ... Since the only character they decided to develop in the previous X movies was wolverine . First Class was good , considering it was entirely different story from the comics that they made their own , but I am worried since this is an existing arc that I was rather fond of ... sigh . * crosses fingers

1 His majestic beard absorbed the fat .

1 I love the movie , too , but never tell someone that a movie will blow their socks off . Never , ever , make someone focus on what the ending may be .

1 It was silenced . Like `` I ____ Ted '' just no sound over `` fucked ''

1 And then I have to watch the rest of the series on DVD ...

1 You mean no one wants to pay artists to make art all day because thats what every artist does and they are literally pouring out of every college at 500000000 a semester that will probably do the shit for $ 8 / hr to stay out a kitchen ?

1 * Begin Again * , starring Kiera Knightley and Mark Ruffalo . It 's almost the same film as Chef , beat for beat , just replace the wonderful food porn with excellent music . It 's not in theaters anymore and it 's not out on Blu / DVD until October 28th , so you 'll have to wait a few weeks .

1 In the comics , yes . They were both in the avengers . As far as the films are concerned , Avengers , Xmen , and Spider man exist in their own universes produced by different studios .

1 that goes without saying ! and who says `` dude '' anymore bro ?

1 To be fair his original opinion of the movie was like the exact opposite ... it was n't til he grew up a bit and rewatched the movie that he felt this way ... and I think the brilliance of this movie is the many ways it can be interpreted .

1 lol ? What if he 'd like to sit ?

1 I do n't know that it went over their head . I was laughing at it , and my gf was n't . She later asked why I thought it was so funny , I explained the joke and she was like . Nah , I knew that was the joke but it just wasnt that funny . People can enjoy standup comedy , yet have different favorite performers . Different jokes for different folks I guess .

1 You cant not click on that and you know it jerk .

1 I tend to think that Predators had a lot going for it in terms of trying to find its own identity , while paying homage to the OG . But they did n't go all the way with it . What they were trying to do was n't lost on me though . We can give Antal credit for that much .

1 Loved him in The Hardy Boys ! And I am also amazed at his ability to metamorphose into a floor .

1 The [ Merlin ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0130414 / ) miniseries with Sam Neill has always been my favourite adaptation . It differs from the original story greatly however . The 1981 version of Excalibur is still the most accurate portrayal AFAIK .

1 Fun fact 2 : Wendy Torrance swings the baseball bat 41 times .

1 San is motivated by hate , to a point in which she would sacrifice her life to killing Eboshi and destroying Irontown . Do you view San as evil ? I 've always seen Lady Ebody 's character as symbolizing the idea of mankind 's thirst for modernization , prosperity and expansion . Out with the old gods , in with the new . The point is that Miyazaki 's characters are wonderful because they are n't one dimensional . I think arguing over `` who is more evil , Jigo or Eboshi '' is entirely subjective .

1 Goldblum is great in the movie . `` Be still , Cody ! ''

1 I think that 's why I like Wolverine and Batman . They are amongst all these superpowered beings who are in theory , way more powerful than them . They still hold their own , and in many cases have taken them down . I guess I like the scrappy underdogs .

1 Well that was quick .

1 Yeah , Gundabad was super disappointing . It was just * so * underwhelming .

1 They prefer to be called wackrican-Americans , racist .

1 Unless he does n't win at EC . In which case , unless either Batista lays his WM Main Event on the line for a match or somehow DBry gets inserted into the match ( I would guess DBry vs HHHaitch for a chance at a Triple Threat Main Event ) it will be Orton vs Batista and we should just deal with it and hope they will give Bryan his rub before his fire goes out .

1 Only God Forgives . Worked on me too ! First watch , I hated it , second watch , I loved it .

1 I do n't know . I have to disagree on this one . I found the entire atmosphere of the first to be far superior in just how naturally creepy and disturbing it was . It really was n't shooting for a comedy as the second did ( and definitely succeeded in ) . Judging each on their own merits I would consider both films to be equal ; the first as a serious yet campy , creepy and gory flick and the second as a bloody , goofy and crazy romp . Then we have army of darkness which is just a stupidly fun 80 minutes . The way I see it , you ca n't go wrong with any film in the Raimi dead trilogy as each film has something to offer dependent on the mood you are in .

1 I 'm a life long Connery as Bond type . If he was in a wheelchair , drooling quietly on himself I 'd still pick him over anyone else , ever . That said , the thing I like most about the most recent Craig as Bond films is that they finally seem to have exercised the groan inducing , hokey-jokey , tongue in cheek zaniness that infected the franchise for far too long . Here are two of the most famous examples ... . * [ The man with the golden gun ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=hh0VF6s-UYU ) . The infamous slide whistle effect . * [ Octopussy ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Yn7S7Ye46Ls & feature=player_detailpage # t=247s ) . The Tarzan yell . Personally I like Craig but what I like most of all is that they finally seem ready to take Bond films seriously again , and it 's about fucking time .

1 I do .

1 No-one going to mention allot ?

1 Godzilla and The Raid 2 : Berandal

1 Does * The Room * count ?

1 I remembering reading about that . Wesley leaving post-it notes ending with `` From Blade '' made me crack up

1 I think that saying any film is impervious to criticism , or rather simply * should n't be * criticized is a bit much . I think , of course , you should look at a film in its context , both the time it was made in and the intended audience , and should not be held to standards that may not be relevant , but criticism of * any * movie is a valuable exercise , I believe . Even the worst films ever made can tell you something about the time they were made in and the people who made them , and therefore hold some artistic value - some means of expressing something - that may not have even been the filmmakers ' intent .

1 lol no

1 I never liked the Tree of Life , but it does have originality going for it .

1 I 'm tired of Martin Lawrence fanatics like yourself barging into every reddit thread where Mrs . Doubtfire is brought up and trying to drag down the movie . We get it ... you like Big Mama 's House . Real talk : Robin Williams does it better !

1 Motherfuckers ai n't banging rocks together . I mean , I 'm sure they had paramedics there but people who flip cars at 80mph have been doing it for 20 years and its just another day at work .

1 They also had communications satellite in the same orbit as the ISS , and all of the space stations within a stone 's throw of each other . These are choices made by the director to tell the story the way he wants to tell it . It has NOTHING to do with the quality of the VFX . Gravity was not a documentary about life in space . It took MANY liberties . It would be like dismissing the overuse of practical effects in Nolan 's movies because no semi tractor trailer is going to flip straight up vertically like the one that did The Dark Knight . I mean seriously ?

1 Agreed . His storyline was pretty damn detailed too . The nicknames to differentiate him from Tony Soprano when they were kids , Tony Soprano smuggling his semen out of prison so he could impregnate the wife , etc ... He was just a likeable character . A lot of it was how he an Tony interacted . And Tony Blundetto ended pretty emotionally as well .

1 That 's what 10 year old me ever wanted ...

1 maybe the atmosphere contains tiny kryptonite particles in it

1 I want a 5 hour cut of both Goodfellas And Casino .

1 HE GET TO STAY IN THE BIG HOUSE ? ? ? !

1 The `` great pilot '' line probably inspired the podrace and `` woo-hoo ! '' scenes in A Phantom Menace .

1 Ayy lmao

1 probably not .

1 Superhero movies do best when they got a clear villain throughout the entire movie . I really hope they do n't split it between Electro and Rhino . Hopefully they just set him up for being the next movie baddie .

1 Only works if your kids are intelligent .

1 Victory has defeated you !

1 I agree , I love both but Julianne Moore was much better .

1 NooooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOoooOOOOOOoooOooOOOoooOOOOO !

1 It 's the opposite - he had too many ideas and had to resort to things like that to cram them all in .

1 Agreed . The only book that has actually worked up a sweat and got my heart racing during the intense battles .

1 um wut

1 Cause it 's fucking Batman .

1 And the next phase of advertising has begun . Very good .

1 Gomorrah

1 Aw crap , giraffeonfire beat me to it .

1 it 's not paul schnieder , it 's rob schneider . and using rob schneider and dignity in the same sentence should get you kicked of reddit .

1 Now that 's just ridiculous .

1 When I read I read the back cover and found that `` The Tower of Babel '' story arc was the the source for this film , I was really excited . Then I watched it and was incredibly disappointed .

1 Yea , not enough Nolan discussion in this thread .

1 It 's staged , pretty sure it was done as a parody of David O. Russell 's arguments with cast members .

1 Indeed !

1 this is on my to watch list !

1 Let 's not overlook The Devils Advocate , in which he gave a great performance .

1 Quiet and / or moving emotional scene ... . SMASH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF HELICOPTER IN FLIGHT WITH FULL ENGINE VOLUME PLUS SUDDEN PUMPING MUSIC ! ! ! ! ! !

1 Agree to disagree . Jack just seems one-dimensional and more human characters are always more compelling to me .

1 DAE Jake from State Farm ?

1 It may have been necessary but the south did not get off easy .

1 But have you seen the 5th season ? Some of those episodes were genius .

1 There 's always quality in Ridley Scott movies !

1 Your second sentence shows yes ; you are mad .

1 [ Wikipedia . ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / The_Hobbit_ % 28film_series % 29 # From_two_to_three_films ) Sometimes I still wonder what the movies would have been like if Del Toro had done them ...

1 One of the greatest horror films ever made .

1 Exactly . I ca n't remember the last time I saw a trailer for an action movie that was this visually stunning at some points .

1 Considering it 's a ~900 year old story ... .probably a lot .

1 I did though ? There were a lot of shitty / disappointing movies this year .

1 I disagree , but can you elaborate ? There are some roles he 's praised for ( * Adaptation . * and * Leaving Las Vegas * , for example ) ; do you argue that the majority are mistaken in praising him for those roles , or that they were flukes , or what ? Not being combative ; I 'm genuinely curious what you think= )

1 I 'll have to go back and watch the directors commentary , but I think that is where I got my info also . It has been a many years though and it deserves another viewing .

1 That ... does n't even make sense

1 Logic is based on premises . Formal systems are necessarily incomplete or inconsistent . Source : Goedel

1 They wo n't use an EU story but they sure could use character names

1 http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=N9_L-2k2zxA

1 that 's a buttload of questions .

1 Because nobody watched Disturbia .

1 Seeing Rodney McKay in that role , young and thin , it was just awesome .

1 It definitely looks like the second -- the kids are n't really * nazis * , just their parents . I 'm assuming them meeting the Jewish kid leads them to become more tolerant . Or something along those lines .

1 Toxic Avengers yes , Arnold no . I just dont see him playing it very well .

1 Just finished my QnA here in NYC . Someone asked about piracy . I said , `` I personally do n't care . People pirate . I just want people to see the film . '' My distributor was in the audience . He shat a brick and is now furious with me . Oops .

1 I 'm not sure what would be the Kafkaesque equivalent of `` What ? ? ? Ekans is evolving ! ''

1 Well i ca n't disagree with you , but whats the harm in trying ? If this movie taught me one thing , it was to never stop believing . As a side question , have you seen this movie ?

1 Dominic Dierkes primarily became a writer , he writes for Workaholics now .

1 Reloaded is pretty awesome .

1 Just found out he 's actually 66 . WHoaa

1 Take it down a notch , champ .

1 My thoughts EXACTLY . Poorly worded title .

1 `` I 'm just saying its possible ! ''

1 Probably because it 's not from Hollywood . > The film was an Italian-led production with co-producers in France and the United Kingdom . [ source ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / The_Tale_of_Tales_ % 28film % 29 )

1 He should win Best Actor- his speech is just him crying and saying , `` Caesar is home '' .

1 It means the dude did n't have a grasp on pacing , all his other talents aside .

1 Star wars

1 the website icheckmovies.com is a good way to find older films . Also Roger Ebert 's Great Films is a perfect source .

1 Oh wow absolutely , the child actor in that film has great things ahead of him .

1 It might be Aaron Sorkin 's writing . It 's like he 's wired on 9 cups of coffee every times he writes his scripts . All the dialogue is super sharp and fast-paced , and he 's reeaaally good at writing asshole characters , but not so great at writing likable characters . I do think Fincher 's direction brought some balance to the screenplay , however , diluting the wordplay with an equally thrilling production style .

1 I 'm so glad this did n't happen .

1 I see you pitched a tent in bed

1 It 's not like there was anything with Wright there to see , and I 'm sure his original input still had some influence on the final movie . People just want to be disappointed since he left .

1 Nah , he played Toecutter in the original , he is a different character in the new one named Immortan Joe

1 i 'll say it : the ending to the game is really stupid . i loved it up until that point .

1 Agreed - I 'd never thought of BoC as making scary music until the lawnmower scene !

1 apparently coming across as a douchebag is n't just for frat boys..

1 I agree `` Trying to please everybody is the surest way to a fail . '' The so called cringe moments will now be eliminated one by one . Unobtainium : We 've been over this one , but oh well , its a real term used very appropriately in this case . USB pony tails : I delighted in this concept , because although it was unnecessary and an almost direct infringement ( Mental telepathy between a rider and his dragon was lifted directly from Anne Mccaffrey : The Dragon Riders of Pern on every single level including a dragon picking his rider ) it made more sense than standard ESP and played a vital role in the whole interconnected ( co-evolutionism ) species theme . And of course we have the one liners `` Let 's dance . '' ( Before a fight ) `` Come to Papa . '' ( character 's nickname is Papa ) `` If I wanted to win , I was going to have to take things to the next level . '' are these really that bad ? I think all of these were more than made up for when Sigourney Weaver tells our main character if he does n't stop playing with his USB ponytail he will go blind ! Lets not forget that a large portion of our audience here are children . While they lack cleverness I think they were necessary comic relief for the kids .

1 Today ? You 're late to the party .

1 Ending spoiler for those who have n't seen it .

1 fuckfuckfuckfuck * pulls the shades *

1 * Drive * had the perfect typeface .

1 Which is strange since 20 years ago he had quite a reputation for being very picky about his roles .

1 NO ! BAD !

1 I 'm just impressed that they managed to make it look like a penis and a vagina simultaneously . Kudos to the physical prop guy for that one .

1 Yeah , it was pretty fucking terrible .

1 But it was done in a non corny completely relevant to the plot 's main context way . And at least [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` he loved a female Russian astronaut '' ) and [ Spoiler ] ( / s `` the plot did n't touch religion even just a bit '' ) . That in my book is an improvement .

1 Yeah but it also shows Will repairing / scanning his leg while on earth

1 God I love the TRON posters . They had huge ones in LA with the disc lit up , I loved driving past them !

1 I weep for my nation and the world if this movie tanks because of faulty marketing . The last trailer / clip showed this movie has heart and deserves to be seen . Please spread the word , and hopefully they can turn the marketing in the right direction . I want risky large concept films to be a standard , not an exception .

1 [ Nerdwriter1 ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / channel / UCJkMlOu7faDgqh4PfzbpLdg ) has a YouTube series called [ `` Understanding Art House '' ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=GXRlGULqHxg & index=1 & list=PLXpCLP6vnS_29yjPugWlHKqan_D_AgX5O ) . However these do n't go into detail of the direction but rather of the film as a whole . It only has 3 episodes right now ( Blade Runner , Snowpiercer and Under the Skin ) but it looks like more are coming in the future .

1 You betcha !

1 Not only that , but at 2:04 the assassin with the bat actually hits himself in the face

1 I do n't understand what you mean .

1 Welcome to reddit .

1 They used their costume budget renting vacuum parts from Dyson for the Sentinels .

1 He just left not joined .

1 * CENAISSWOL *

1 But he and Leo end up buddies at the end , so it 's cool , and his reputation is unbesmirched .

1 You do n't exactly need to be a psychic to guess that though . Almost everyone loves the Nolan movies .

1 Yeah man , I 've thought about it . It 's just super hard to make something and present it to Reddit without them thinking you 're trying to get free advertising haha

1 So do you have a source or are you just going to be a sarcastic douche without backing yourself up ? I seriously doubt NK is behind this , but if you 're going to state something as a fact and then be an ass with your closing sentence the least you cold do is give a source .

1 I do n't think I have seen it praised for unpredictable ?

1 Hey hey he 's not a rodent , he 's more related to cats , dogs and bears .

1 People do believe it though . Braveheart made people think Prima Nocte was commonplace , when it was barely practiced . Gladiator is full of fallacies . These movies are portrayed as correct , complete with miniature incorrect history lessons before the movie .

1 Blade II was really good too . Great action . But the first one was dripping atmosphere and so unexpected . I mean think about it . Marvel 's dipping their toe in the water and they release an R rated film on a relatively unknown character ? Brassy .

1 You must be thinking of your mom . Sasha Grey is a porn star .

1 I enjoyed the Conjuring .

1 This was me , until recently when I was able to catch Psycho on TV . I loved it so much that now all I want to do is watch all his films . Definitely made me realize what a talent Anthony Perkins was .

1 She was great in Short Term 12 .

1 I remember enjoying the movie , but I also remember that it felt kind of silly and disorganized . And I was 9 . That said , I do think it 's underrated . Perhaps people had really high expectations for it because of the director and cast .

1 Well , you never go full retard .

1 1 . Netflix is n't who you should be fighting . They have just as much trouble trying to reason with the studios as others do . 2 . Temporary boycotts do n't work . It 'll just mean people will buy twice as much in April . 3 . This particular boycott wo n't work because you 'll never get nearly enough people to make an impact .

1 Yeah he played Mr. Furlong the science teacher .

1 TIL

1 I stand corrected . Look at my incorrect comment , now look at me , look back at my incorrect comment * THE COMMENT IS NOW DELETED * . I 'm on the internet .

1 What I mean is that Sherlock Holmes was mostly known for how he figured out the mysteries with reason and an encyclopedic knowledge for just about anything , while other people were either just stumped or were using legends and folklore to rationalise a situation . Instead of using this as the main drive for the picture it has become a family action movie where Holmes ' superior intellectual capabilities are used for nothing other than one-upmanship in conversation so they can reassert the fact he is the main character ... .. oh and also so he can plan how to kick someone 's arse . In the first film there were clues to find , puzzles to solve , a villain to catch out as a fraud . Was any of that included in this debacle ? No , it 's spoon-fed nonsense from start to finish . Edit : missed comma .

1 The Samurai Trilogy directed by Hiroshi Inagaki and starring Toshir ? Mifune 47 Ronin Zatoichi Lone Wolf and Cub Rashomon

1 `` You 're about to get stuffed , bitch ! ''

1 My thoughts exactly , played on a totally different note than brando 's , but on the same caliber none the less

1 Also , there is a refreshing absence of lazer-whips . I like that .

1 I only saw it once , but I thought I heard the FBI folks saying it was half a billion - 500million . think about the breaking bad stack of cash - that was easily 150M , the safe was bigger than that , so it made sense in my mind ...

1 Seconded .

1 Dom DeLuise ? ; )

1 Much like Rachel Leigh Cook in the original She 's All That , this film does not need a makeover . It 's perfectly fine the way it is .

1 His storyline was n't resolved in that film . The last scene of him in QoS , IIRC , was during the opera scene . We 're never told what happeNed to him .

1 Next time just go with `` 10 amazing Blade Runner facts ''

1 I disagree . I think Nolan is atrocious at filming fights clearly and instead relies on needless and disorienting cuts .

1 Thirteen was back on point IMO

1 I assumed he said that because of the saying `` gods can bleed '' and super man was worshipped like some god . I thought it was a cool line personally

1 Ok , it was interesting to learn about the Star Wars / LOTR trilogies , but to have each film comprise one of the `` 10 '' is just fucking lazy writing .

1 loved the soundtrack to this as well as the food porn

1 He 's also King George in the newest Pirates of the Caribbean

1 No one at Target cowers from me . The only people afraid of me are the ones who need to be . I realized that my image was taking down this road when I stunt coordinated a movie with Ron Perlman and upon meeting Ron , he looked at me and said , `` You 're one ugly motherfucker . I 'll bet you work a lot . '' My response , as I walked away , laughing , `` I just got called ugly by Ron Perlman ! I got something I can cash in ! ''

1 Like it did for Avengers ?

1 They 're all remakes of Laurence of Arabia

1 I 'm fucking thrilled . Prisoners was awesome but Enemy was brilliant . Very satisfied and looking forward to this .

1 KANO

1 I 'm pretty sure you said `` dick cream '' ...

1 `` I believe I might be of service '' LETS DANCE !

1 Not really . http : / www.imdb.com / media / rm449365248 / tt2446042

1 NOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooo

1 Man I 'm sick of people parroting those lines from Fight Club like they 're really super-special for seeing through life 's bullshit , like they 're the only ones to do so : you 're just repeating empty cynicism from a popular movie .

1 yeah screw Dan Harmon for giving him a job , how dare he !

1 You 're wrong , taxi driver lost to casablanca

1 I hope The Hateful Eight is a great conclusion to the trilogy .

1 [ Yep ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=bgo0CDL6bd0 )

1 I saw it twice in the theater thinking it really was n't that bad .

1 I was eight and my father took me to the opening event . I knew just a little about it , not much television allowed ( thankfully ) . Needless to say , it blew my mind .

1 Its a story , but as u / DoctorGonzo points out , its also an honor thing . Paris uses a bow because that was considered the weapon of a coward . As another character says to him after Paris shoots him in * The Illiad * : > '' ... brave with your bow and arrows-big bravado ? Come , try me in [ close range ] hand to hand combat-bow and arrows will never help you then. ? >

1 Replace Paul Walker with Helen Mirren and act as if it was always like that . Just play it straight .

1 dig this . great , unpretentious list ... .. for the longest time could n't boogie with rio bravo because i loathe the duke ... but i went to a hawks retrospective and it turned me on my head . if you have n't seen scarface , do so . often silly and obviously dated , but there 's a real , teeth-bearing , menacing quality that most shoot 'em up movies miss out on today .

1 He was better than Tobey Maguire . Garfield had the great scene with the carjacker , which was Spider-man cracking jokes like he is in the comics . If they do more of that in the sequel , sign me up !

1 Glad to hear ! Pieta is easily one of the best films I 've seen all year and I ca n't wait to see it again . Also Wrong was pretty enjoyable , though definitely not for everyone .

1 added : )

1 I wonder if they show any bias in the recommended times . Like a recommendation for Battleship : just go whenever the fuck you want , you are n't missing anything .

1 It 's worth a read . The movie changed the ending a good bit , but most people think it 's for the better .

1 IS THERE AIR ? ? YOU DO N'T KNOW ! ! !

1 ... one of the most popular movies of all time , sir ! What were you thinking ! ? ... ... .I mean , thank you , come again .

1 Pixar 's `` generally amazing movies '' .

1 What the fuck ! ?

1 Yeah well as far as I know this could just be one of those stories that starts to get passed down as fact . I just heard it from a tour guide so who knows ?

1 I just got back from it with my girlfriend . I 'm torn between calling it a borderline chick flick , and a zombie rom-com . It 's definitely not as accessible as say , Shaun of the Dead , in terms of male / female equal enjoyment , as it 's low on gore and high on romantic elements . It 's a great movie , though , I thought . To be honest , it 's more of a date movie than something to see on your own , but it 's planets away from Twilight . The romance is n't really mushy or ridiculous , and the deadpan humor is pretty fun . It 's no Zombieland , though . The PG-13 feels like a leash on the whole experience .

1 Liam and me , we gon na fuck you up .

1 In the original film Han shot first . More info : http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Han_shot_first

1 Hear , hear .

1 I just watched The Congress . The man can think like no other .

1 Same here dude . No matter how much you tell your friends on 4th of July you have work tomorrow , those pints of beer are not gon na finish themselves .

1 Ahhh , then I nominate Jim Breur and Craig Gass for their respective Metallica and Kiss impersonations !

1 Can you blame me ? Usually the last scene of a movie is pretty big .

1 I remember seeing this for the first time and laughing so incredibly hard in the theater ... good memory ; )

1 Tom Hanks looks like Tom Hanks From Cloud Atlas ... AKA ... like shit .

1 Exactly . The fact that you 're observing it and thinking about it makes it successful art . People are so hung up on the concept of movies as a product that 's objectively `` good '' or `` bad '' . The commercialization of film is to blame , so it 's nice to see some more intellectually challenging stuff like Enemy getting attention , even if it 's only `` omg so weird '' .

1 Those are his kids ?

1 TIL people hate hook

1 These parents would give you a long spiel about sexual morality , but I really think it comes down to they just feel fundamentally awkward , embarrassed , and uncomfortable with the questions that both sex in movies and sex ed in school would raise . Nothing causes people to be irrationally angry like embarrassment .

1 > But instead , Mor'du was just some evil dude from long ago . Not just `` some evil dude '' -- a negative role model for Merida . Mor'du 's selfishness presaged Merida 's own . Merida was so obsessed with changing her own fate that she forgot to consider whether it would be changed for the better or for the worse , and who else would be caught up in the upheaval . The discovery of Mor'du 's kingdom is also confirmation of the truth of the legend Elinor spoke of , and shows that Elinor was not just blowing smoke , which Merida had not until that moment the maturity to see . Also , when the stone falls on Mor'du and his spirit is released -- if you look carefully you can see it change into a wisp . Who else from legend and lore had been guiding Merida on her fateful journey ?

1 I will never turn down the chance to click that link .

1 But Wild Zero is n't a bad movie . It 's a weird movie , but not a bad one .

1 Aaaand now `` It 's A Jungle Out There '' is stuck in my head haha

1 please tell me you 're being sarcastic.. i must know

1 Is point is that it 's all about ease of access and quality . He does n't mind paying for something , but jumping through hoops to pay or viewing on their schedule wo n't happen if there 's a free , no hassle alternative that you decide when or how you watch it .

1 I love that movie . So sad , so great . The soundtrack is awesome , especially [ Elegy for Dunkirk ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=aONP8zR8X38 )

1 how about you live your life instead of being a cunt

1 Shared lead between two genders .

1 Plot of Alien : Onset , discovery , confirmation , confrontation , with characters experiencing `` supernatural '' dread of the unknown . It 's horror , in a science fiction milieu . Many horror-genre movies are not in fact horror stories - they contain familiar horror elements but might be comedies , dramas , character studies etc .

1 Loved Sunshine ; I think it just did n't fit a lot of stereotypes for a sci-fi film which may have hurt some people 's interpretations . There was n't any mad aliens hunting a crew on a spaceship and there was n't insane tech and artistic combat . Instead you had a lot of personal tension and relationships and human psyche trials and tribulations and a sense of near-extinction for humanity because of something thought to be almost eternal : the continuance of the sun .

1 As someone who has seen a `` Fast and Furious '' movie , I ca n't figure out for the life of me how someone who has not seen one of the movies can judge other people for seeing them .

1 plus Siwon from Super Junior

1 I liked * Taken * and I thought the phone conversation was badass but yeah would n't say the greatest action flick ever .

1 I 'm guessing you 've already watched the Red Letter Media / Harry Plinkett reviews of the prequels , but in case you have n't , look them up . It 's a very in-depth look at * why * those movies are so terrible . I 'd also suggest watching the documentary The People Vs . George Lucas . It goes over the history of the whole thing and what went wrong .

1 ONLY 87 ? ? holy shit , that 's a disaster . They must really hate it . IMDb has it listed as the 6th best film of all time with over 200,000 votes so I 'm afraid that your claim of it being underrated is erroneous , dear boy . In fact , 8 of the `` underrated '' films you mention have a place on the top films chart , and do n't give me the `` that chart is n't an accurate representation of the greatest films '' etc etc . It may not be accurate but if there 's anything that the films on there are not , it 's underrated .

1 What about those of us who disliked him since 2010 ? Or are we just hipsters and you ca n't fathom how nolan is legitimately disliked ?

1 More importantly , how 's your Dad doing ?

1 Why ? Romero zombies have always used tools . Bub is even taught how to use tools .

1 2 DOLLARS ! !

1 babe : pig in the city

1 The original cars on tracks is too linear for modern audiences , they decided to make franchise open world .

1 If it was a standalone film , I 'd say okay but it 's part of a larger universe and based off of existing characters which are very `` real '' ( at least in context to the fictional Marvel universe ) .

1 The Faculty gets bonus points for having Jon Stewart .

1 Only the dramatic bits .

1 He has shiny eyes that give him darkvision , that 's something .

1 I 'm going to have to watch The Three Colours .

1 At least you balance out the opposite end of the spectrum .

1 How about The Celebration ? To say it 's my favourite foreign would be cheating , since I live in Denmark , but I 've never seen it discussed online .

1 For [ reference ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / WaGScZT.jpg )

1 I highly recommend Lone Survivor , its really not a propaganda piece . The movie is as apolitical as it gets , its tightly focused solely on the SEALs trying to survive and make no real moral judgements about whether they 're in the right or wrong or if the war was right or wrong . SPOILERS . . . . Also that line is sadly sarcastic at that point , they all pretty much realize they 're dying , its classic gallows humor .

1 They were n't doing coke .

1 Oh my God , thank you . I had completely forgotten about this one , and it 's one of my all-time favorites . I never knew my real father and my step-father walked out on us when I was 11 so that stuff REALLY hit hard . Hell , I 'm 19 now and I watched it like eight or so months ago , having not seen it since before he left . Tears were shed that day the likes of which only Up has forced upon me .

1 I get where the video is coming from but a lot of those `` sins '' were clutching at straws because that guy does n't like the film .

1 Kurosawa borrowed from John Ford , Leone from Kurosawa .

1 Yolandi Visser of Die Antwoord .

1 All artists are like this , with every kind of art .

1 Its funny cloverfield came to my mind as well and i actually enjoyed the style during cloverfield because it was a reason to keep the monster a mystery , personally the best part in my opinion is when andrew dies , i just thought it was really cool .

1 She was so hot .

1 He plays a Canadian , eh .

1 For anyone not aware , this is the `` Requiem for a Dream '' theme song . And is probably one of the most overused overtures ever . It 's brilliant , and in the movie is great , but then they started using it and remakes as the songs for other movies ( wtf ? ) and car commercials and shit and now it 's totally ruined .

1 It 's so good . Saw it last night . : )

1 Naked is a very thought provoking film that juxtaposes a troubled guy who likes semi consensual sex with a irredeemable psycho who turns sex very non consensual for his own twisted power games . If this sounds too dark for you , some of Mike Leigh 's other great films are Secrets and Lies , Another Year , Happy Go Lucky , Career Girls , and Abigail 's Party . He always digs deep into the flaws of his characters without excusing or condemning them , which I feel is very difficult to do well .

1 Paul Thomas Anderson Wes Anderson Paul W.S . Anderson Its mildly interesting how Paul W.S . Anderson sort of sounds like a combination of the name of two of my favorite great directors , and is ( if the post above is factual ) even related to them , but he 's my most hated director .

1 Cried like a bitch watching it in theaters with some girl . They nailed the post breakup stress .

1 Did random pages on purpose . too many words per page- too much room for error

1 Its a trope dating back to the books themselves . Hobbits are good at throwing rocks . The animation was a bit off but if you remember in LOTR , Merry and Pippin did it a lot in the movie particularly in the siege of Isengard ...

1 Maybe you should n't have thrown them away . Now the universe has made all of us suffer .

1 Every time I place my ass in a theater seat , it does n't have to be King 's Speech . South Park : BLU is fucking retarded , yet it 's amazing .

1 Have you not noticed Nigel possessing people all the time ?

1 In most children movies I 've ever seen , especially from the 80 's and 90 's , the adults were always depicted either as bumbling idiots or completely disregard anything the kid protagonist says , forcing them to take matters into their own hands . Seriously , if your kid runs into your room saying someone 's breaking into the house , and you 're a parent in a 90 's kid movie , you 'll tell them it 's just their imagination and send them back to bed .

1 `` If you do this , I will eat . Your . Face ! '' -John Lithgow

1 Ben Stiller . So hot right now . Ben Stiller .

1 `` ... Though , you might make me jealous . '' Love that movie .

1 As in Hitch Hitchhiker 's Guide , he plays the audience - he 's fairly smart , has a relatively mundane life , and has little interest in the weirdness around him . He does it well , but he does it a lot .

1 she just constantly seems to be trying soooo hard to be funny . also , being fat and raunchy and nothing else does n't really make me laugh .

1 I thought his accent in there will be blood at some points sounded like ron burgundy

1 I saw it . It was pretty good . Pretty rough at times but it felt real . And it was necessary for the end .

1 Holy fuck . You 're cool . Can I get your autograph ?

1 Yeah it changes drastically after that , it becomes a typical kill-fest but it 's still entertaining . But that scene when they drive past the church and he 's tossing those bodies down the chute is still on of my favorite horror related scenes in any movie .

1 We 're talking about British musicians in this thread !

1 I did n't mean for it to sound like I was hating on him , I did n't really think anyone was hating on me in the first place . I meant it as a joke

1 Everytime I see the start , I 'm thinking `` LET THE GOD DAMN GUY KILL IT ''

1 Any point there were multiple Johnny Depp 's in that movie ... I get they 're trying to make him quirky but for the love of -- enough is enough .

1 Reddit meetup .

1 What did he do ?

1 Dude 's got a kid to feed .

1 Rolling under the truck had me laughing my ass off in the theater . That was amazing .

1 Do not be sad that he has completed his life , Be happy he lived and affected you the way he did . The pain of knowing he is gone is there but think , what life would have been like without spock ? Who would have taught impressionable kids to try and use logic and reason to solve problems ? To prize intelligence . Today may be a sad day , but i take comfort that he was so beloved in his life .

1 I watched the original after seeing Road Warrior , it 's totally different . Also , as an American , I had almost no idea what anybody was saying .

1 Agreed . The first Iron Man was good , not great , but it ended with the promise of a really good franchise . So Iron Man 2 being bad was a huge disappointment , but RDJ 's performance kept people interested . So I think that when Iron Man 3 came around fans had so much invested in a series that did n't payoff that they just did n't want to admit that it was lousy .

1 I 'd pair Labyrinth with Dark Crystal .

1 Yep she was a shitty person and Idc .

1 Way too soon and it reeks of being a fast cash grab

1 You are * vastly * overestimating the value of the `` perks '' being given away . When done in bulk , T-shirts can be had for about 1.50 each . Many of the things given away have no monetary value at all ( production updates ! script pdf ! whoooo ) .

1 I know what you mean about the ending . She basically just told him `` what you did was okay because we 're better than everyone else '' which I do n't think is really in line with the rest of the film . The movie was so heavy that I expected it to hammer a point home at the end but it kind of fell flat with that scene .

1 He was fantastic in Thumbsucker , which I think really shows his range in his soft spoken / muted way .

1 haha . i was looking for Ip man in that list too

1 The friend was Marc Lee , the quote is from his last letter home . Full text is here : http : / americasmightywarriors.org / _a / marcs-last-letter-home /

1 The * DeLorean * would be my choice too . People were really choked when it got smashed .

1 HORROR WESTERN . NEAT

1 My dad and his brothers always watch Christmas Vacation together every Christmas . While they watch the movie they are quoting every line as it happens and cracking up like it 's the first time they 've seen it .

1 I do n't know man I just got pissed off every time they did it . I can see why you liked it but personally it just made me think of the final fight as , `` fucking finally they 're showing them battle . ''

1 Disliking Drive , does n't mean `` you do n't enjoy cinema '' , holy fuck that just came off * so * pretentious .

1 Seems like it would be the theaters own demise . Movie goers eventually will stop putting up with that and just rent them from home .

1 That and the sleep scene got to me . Dear god , I did n't get any sleep that night

1 > About what genre they wanted to parody I 'm sorry if this seems nitpicky , but Shaun and Fuzz are in no way parodies . Scary Movie is a parody , Shaun and Fuzz are homages to their respective genres . They 're genre films that wink at the classic tropes of their respective genres , and they include references to their favorite films of said genre . They did an excellent job of playing with the cliches and making them their own . They 're almost a deconstruction of action and horror , and put back together by people who recognize the genre and poke fun at it while respecting it . * The World 's End * however , is different in this respect . They just went straight Sci-Fi comedy , they had the basic homages to the genre in the story . ( i.e. the * Invasion of the Body Snatchers * plot , Aliens reference , etc ) Although in this one Wright and Pegg made the conscious decision to focus instead on the meat of the story ( they actually said this in an interview ) , the complexity of the characters , and the emotion they portray . Which personally I think really shines through . This one was n't trying to pay tribute to sci-fi as much as it was using it to tell the story of Gary King , and humanity . Which really , is the heart of Sci-Fi . Using extraordinary circumstances and fantastical elements to get across messages with great significance , while providing an interesting take on a traditional tale . So really , I think they rocked it .

1 The original is one of my favorite horror comedies right along side `` The Mummy '' . Some films you just have to watch every time they come on .

1 Capote ?

1 arnold is au naturel

1 And to think these people are paid to ask those questions ...

1 ... I would assume it would be the same movie everywhere ...

1 > After City of Lost Children : 'No more subtitles . ' That breaks my heart .

1 Because it 's much easier to get more minorities to feel jaded if they see the evil white man .

1 Alas poor Yorick , you 've been terminated .

1 Really , Jango Fett ? Nothing ?

1 In the first battle , [ Book information ] ( / s `` He uses Dr . Device against a massing of ships , not a planet . The only time a planet is in the battle , let alone has Dr . Device fired at it , is in the final battle . '' )

1 I 'm a big fan of the Christopher Guest Mockumentary crew and the Stella related crew ( Paul Rudd , Michael Ian Black , David Wain , Michael Showalter , Elizabeth Banks , A.D . Miles , the list goes on and on and on ) .

1 Yes .

1 really ? I find it a pretty potent movie about the problems of teens in the 80s , from simple things like crushes to heavy topics like abortion . I never lived through the 80s so I have no nostalghia to go back on , so I mostly looked at it from a 21st century standpoint . The dialogue is good , but even when a movie Cameron Crowe wrote is bad , the dialogue is usually pretty good . It certainly is rooted in the 80s but I think it holds up rather well .

1 Primer , my brain was upside down after watching it

1 In all honesty , I do n't feel that your idea is completely without merit ( as I stated in my original comment ) . The tone of the article is where it went wrong . The title sets a negative tone with `` Why Idiocracy is just a little bit misunderstood '' . It assumes that there 's something wrong with the way Idiocracy fans have been enjoying the film , and how you are now going to elucidate as to why . The article then presents weak evidence for your theory . Instead , the article could have taken the stance of curiosity , where you explore the evidence behind your idea and then ask the audience if your idea has merit . You based your whole article on a very small piece of evidence and then presumed that you had struck gold and figured that everyone else `` misunderstands '' Idiocracy . Even if you are correct , I would expect someone to provide more evidence to illustrate that theme then what you have provided in the article .

1 Nope .

1 Do n't let someone `` fear '' you into not watching something , or preventing you from being exposed to ideas . That 's the more dangerous thing , than being exposed to biased presentations . It 's about a bunch of religious theories and modern day conspiracies and gives some evidence of them being true , but that does n't mean that they are . It 's a good info-flick to watch regardless and choose to believe what you want , but use common sense .

1 Also the daughter from The Descendants . And she was damn good in that .

1 god I know it . she 's married to judd apatow so no matter what she 's going to have some role in his movies .

1 Eh , I would n't be too sure about that . From the trailers , it looks like it 'll play with a lot of the same tropes as the first movie , just on a much larger scale with bigger stakes .

1 The majority of these are pretty much the guidelines for any story ever . Status quo , character wants something , something is in their way ( conflict ) , and they either succeed or do n't , but change occurs , either in who they are as a person or their external circumstances . There is quite literally no story that does n't conform to at least one of these things .

1 And of the bug played by the voice actor who died during production .

1 It 's Dr Evil . I did n't go to evil medical school to be called Mr. Thank you very much

1 Yes , I miss Bachelor Party and The Burbs Tom ... Love all his work , but I 'd like to see him get silly again

1 Oh , it 's this post again ...

1 IMO the best version of A Christmas Carol there is . The songs are humorous and touching ( With a glass raised to toast your health ! ) and Michael Caine is fantastic as Ebenezer Scrooge .

1 I 'm not sure it was their intention , but I was pretty sure it was supposed to be part of his unspecified injuries from back in the prison .

1 [ Here are two more images ] ( http : / imgur.com / a / SdqVn )

1 Based just on that opinion . Bombs away !

1 Because I 'm sick and tired of kids screaming , screaming , screaming everywhere I go .

1 I think the film flowed better without her there . I felt like it actually made the film stronger because it sort of implied that she had already died and Iceman was so bummed that he grew a beard . I do hope they follow through and include the cut scenes on the Blu-ray though .

1 I think it 'll have to fight Holy Motors for that title .

1 10 things about `` Dazed and Confused '' you can find out by looking at its wikipedia page : P

1 I agree with you , its not nearly his best film . But the QT scene really stuck out like a sore thumb .

1 THIS scene . Got me , better , got my inner little girl . No , I am not pregnant .

1 This movie has immediately become my pick for most badass movie EVER .

1 You forgot The Lego Movie .

1 He said it can ruin the way we get there not that it always will .

1 Also you lose a lot of the subtleties of a language when you do n't speak it .

1 Spoilers from a comic book that 's been out since the 2007 ? Are you serious right now ? http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Civil_War_ ( comics )

1 Meh he 's a pretty rich guy that has plausible deniability . He 'll get a slap on the wrist

1 He lived with Hunter Thompson for 6 months or something before filming started so that is a distinct possibility .

1 Might be an unpopular opinion , but I really dislike how long the intro to this movie is .

1 `` Of course , you 'll have the good taste not to mention that I spoke to you . ''

1 See it for FREE ! [ Who Killed Captain Alex : Uganda 's First Action Movie ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=sy0OOVTmsJI ) Wakaliwood : [ Official Website ] ( http : / watch.wakaliwood.com / )

1 But those visuals look amazing . I feel like I 'll watch it at least twice if the story is n't lackluster .

1 You sound like you do n't completely get the joke : https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=ToaHQI9X5RI

1 `` Please format your comments in MLA , include sources , and proper spelling is a must . I have a hard time turning it in ... I mean reading it , if it is not properly formatted ''

1 There 's one of the hellraisers that takes on a groundhog day style premise . Was very pleasantly surprised by that one . Forgot which one it was though

1 He was also charged with illegally hunting a deer or something like that . I thought he would die of natural causes before the court rules .

1 pretty sure it 's [ Mako ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Mako_Iwamatsu )

1 Congratulations Jackie Chan for 100 years of entertainment !

1 Whatever it takes to get us those two sequels , damnit ! !

1 It will probably receive more attention once it receives a wide DVD release + it 's inevitable Netflix release . The lack of enthusiasm is simply people not having the means / being unwilling to go venture into their local independent theater . Side note : I saw it . It 's a blast . It 's not perfect , but it 's a lot of fun .

1 This list needed 3 Days of The Condor .

1 : o

1 ca n't wait to -- * inhales from bong *

1 Beetlejuice .

1 Make the central arcs into a movie series and make the individual stories into multi-medium companion anthologies , like the Animatrix was to the Matrix .

1 Honestly I would rather have DC and Warner bros give me heavy stories that speak deeper into the philosophy of the `` hero '' . While Marvel stays to their lighthearted feel and gives action packed popcorn blockbusters . It just works better that way IMO

1 I always pictured my life as an adult ( which is funny to say because I 'm 24 ) like her and Peter . I just need a really hot redhead to keep me and my ridiculous schemes in line .

1 godfather , part 1 .

1 When Bond has to subdue a villain in Portland I 'm sure that offer will come through .

1 Idris Elba is legitimately good in it . But then again , he 's good in everything .

1 I 'm all for it . Pixar has made my 2nd and 3rd favorite movies of all-time . So if they need they need the money for another original movie , they can go right ahead and make Cars 3 .

1 Do people from moviescirclejerk ever discuss movies , I thought they only discussed memes and shit ?

1 And even today Kevin Spacey is loved all the same .

1 There are n't many song and dance men around any more . Dick Van Dyke is another example of great talent !

1 To give a serious answer , if you did n't see it in theaters or with a good sound system , you missed out on the point . The story was laughable and the acting intentionally campy , because the focus was on making the Jaeger 's immersively gratuitous and visceral feeling . You had giant robots fighting that really captured the scale of what `` giant '' means . If it 's not your thing , the movie ( or any like it for that matter ) is n't for you and they 're ok with that .

1 I think the fact that we never have discovered who the killer is , in the Zodiac case and Jack the Ripper , is one of the biggest reasons why these cases have such intrigue about them . Because the killer is this mysterious person who we will likely never know who they are . I disagree about the movie not having a strong resolution . I think the scene in the diner at the end is a great resolution , with the few wrap-up scenes that follow .

1 They had a bartender here , Kino . Made the best rum cannonball I 've ever tasted . What a shame .

1 That looks TERRIBLE .

1 I think the wife lived . He killed three people , the three year old , the five year old and the 17 year old . The letter was signed Mr. & Mrs . Schwartz .

1 Agreed . Imitation game was clunky . Odd that it won ?

1 He 's like a cross between Christian Bale and Ben Stiller in that first photo .

1 What memories ! * CREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK *

1 No , it 's the sound of the `` remove '' button being clicked with much more abandon .

1 Hmmmm , I think Tyler Perry movies would probably be horrible no matter the cast . Though seeing Daniel Day Lewis playing Madea would at least be more interesting ...

1 White people are dancing .

1 Yep , got mixed up ! Not seen the film in a long time !

1 Spoilers ! Spoilers ! Get out of here with any of that hacked shit .

1 They did n't die in the car that time . Phil swerved out of the way of the train , they crashed and ended up in jail . It was too early for flapjacks .

1 Nobody calls her that . : )

1 Nice try , Blended marketing team !

1 Mickey mouse is ALSO a trademark , at this point , but before that he was a character in animated stories , under copyright like anything else . Those animated films are still protected by copyright . Trademarks do n't expire , so far as I know . Not like copyright does .

1 I was somewhat dragged to this . I do n't normally do slashers or horrors . I sat it the dark theatre wondering how much I would actually watch , without peeking through the gap of my fingers . The result surprised me no end . It 's a really great watch , funny , intense and definitely different . Best surprise this year .

1 Any time I think of that scene , the only like that comes to mind for me is `` Gentlemen , it has been an honor . ''

1 There 's a good reason for that feeling .

1 Who cares ? Besides that guy who is angry at something else and funneled it toward American remakes of foreign films ...

1 That is why I 'm glad he is doing this movie , cgi looks much better when it is used to add to a scene , rather than it being used to create a scene .

1 nothing , he is n't in it

1 Obligatory `` you 're everywhere , '' comment .

1 I DO N'T KNOW

1 The trailer 's not like the movie at all . It really becomes a good movie as it goes along .

1 * Parts * of * The Illusionist * are good , but that love scene in front of the fireplace ... just holy shit . It 's like they brought in the writers from a bad TV soap to write the most cliched love dialogue they could imagine , and follow it up with a slow pan to a fireplace . It was the sort of stuff I 'd expect in a South Park parody of a movie love scene .

1 [ Falling Down -1993 ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0106856 / ) I would n't say he 's evil per say , but he 's definitely got some darkness to him .

1 So this means that Iron Man 3 , Batman Returns , and Die Hard make up the holy trilogy of surprise Christmas movies .

1 Or insist on drinking Corona

1 No , but Argo was nominated for Best Picture .

1 I enjoyed it quite a bit . The montage at the beginning had me tearing up . Overall , it was just as fun and cute as I was expecting it to be . I recommend seeing it in 3D .

1 RIP ... .

1 World 's Greatest Dad

1 This guy really does n't like dinosaurs ...

1 I 'm pretty sure J.J . 's next movie will be either Episode IX or an original movie .

1 I would have a hard time accepting someone other than Adam West or Clint Eastwood in that role .

1 Tremors 2 is the best B movie ever made .

1 I thought the best part was the pony blowing up the Statue of Liberty .

1 `` Well , they 're not actually scars . It 's movie makeup . ''

1 Sorry , I 'm not giving proof . I 'd rather be doubted by someone on the internet than get me and my old bosses in trouble . It 's a small town .

1 As a young kid watching Jedi I felt for the furry little bastard .

1 Actually if I remember correctly the movie is based on a true story . The author wrote it as penance for his failure ( do n't want to spoil the ending ) .

1 how many people are going to post without reading the description at all ?

1 There are no more barriers to cross . All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane , the vicious and the evil , all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed . My pain is constant and sharp , and I do not hope for a better world for anyone . In fact , I want my pain to be inflicted on others . I want no one to escape . But even after admitting this , there is no catharsis ; my punishment continues to elude me , and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself . No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling . This confession has meant nothing .

1 Wow , everything from the titles to the over the top sex and violence , this is the most Cronenberg looking Cronenberg film since eXistenZ . I 'm pretty damn excited .

1 I 'm going to ask you for a citation on that .

1 Ca n't do that either because then there are fewer showings and less in ticket sales .

1 Dracula Dead and Loving It , is how I found out about enemas .

1 You 're joking right ?

1 Easily one of the finest moments captured on film . Brando was brilliant , and the scene is heart breaking . Cliche , maybe , but for a DAMN fine reason . Every time I see it linked I usually watch it .

1 I do n't know why I forgot that he was a major writer in the comics world .

1 Perfect for watching while working .

1 I find it 's actually a great adaptation of the book not because it represents the book note for note , but if you read the book , the movie adds a lot of color . They go together well .

1 I ca n't watch any Highlander because of Christopher Lambert 's face .

1 And the asides are played with him looking directly at the camera . Humorous , confronting and mad at the same time .

1 And now it 's * my * favorite Linda Blair pic . I made this .

1 Take yer stinkin paws off me you damn dirty ape !

1 They always seem like they are trying too hard to be artsy and quirky . I ca n't stand him either .

1 `` I must know if Mark Hamill can still be a compelling dramatic screen presence and if John Boyega can crossover fully into Hollywood 's A-list ! No embargoes on the magic of film ! ''

1 He actually never says those exact words ... He says , [ `` No , I am your father '' ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? feature=player_detailpage & v=h6sj89xgnl4 # t=102s )

1 No it was actually pretty good and had some really good twists in it

1 Yes , yes we do . Toy Story 3 was incredible , I 'm sure the Incredibles 2 will be as well .

1 he wanted some snow , dawg .

1 So he should have Hulk-sized his popcorn and drink ? : -D

1 If that is what you think of it than yes , that is what I am looking for .

1 Yeah , I came here to post this film . Stephen Rea portrays the cop who spends years of his life tracking a serial killer without a break or any backup , all while the Soviets hide the crimes from the public .

1 Uh , yeah . Head-scratcher . I mean , it paints Cera as either a big trolly douche , or the loneliest fucking guy in LA . And that Jeremy guy gives no fucks haha Also , he probably started hooking up with that chick , and it was Jeremy 's girl and they got into an argument . Other than that , I have no idea .

1 Yeah , anyone who watches martial arts films knows that , it would be like putting Enter the Dragon on the list as well .

1 Whatever doubts I had about this man when I first learned of his existence five minutes ago , they have been dead-weighted and dropped off the pier -- I fucking hate this man .

1 I like Guy Pierce , but Max would have been so much better the way they filmed it . I did n't watch any of the Viral stuff before I saw it and it never clicked the old man was Guy .

1 I find them shallow and pedantic .

1 That seems like a really crap promotion .

1 The Little Mermaid .

1 If you consider JJ Abrams `` utter shit '' I think you need to go see some really shitty movies . Maybe he 's not the best but he 's sure as hell better than Lucas or M Night

1 The superfluous adjectives in your post are giving me a headache .

1 Honestly to me this looks like a piece of goddamn Modern Warfare cover art .

1 Law enforcement arrives at an isolated outpost , and quickly finds itself under assault from overwhelming numbers . Prisoners and a famous killer ( awaiting transport ) have to team up with their law enforcement captors and barricade themselves into an abandoned police station to survive . The famous killers even have the same type of weird names . `` Desolation Williams '' and `` Napoleon Wilson '' . You 're right , nothing like each other at all ... John Carpenter loves siege movies . Assault was his remake of Rio Bravo ( it had `` Colorado Ryan '' ) Hell , several scenes in Assault and Ghosts was lifted straight out of Rio Bravo ( Colorado Ryan , Napoleon Wilson and Desolation Williams tossing a rifle / shotgun to the law enforcement protagonist at a critical moment ) .

1 Submarine

1 No it is n't .

1 I 'm just not too excited about an Ackroyd looking porn star myself .

1 What ? What editing skills ?

1 Well , and the sex scene , which I find super-hilarious .

1 I just left the theatre thinking what the fuck was that movie about / why was it made . Felt it was over acted ( not bale ) and overly complicated . Then again I went in with high expectations . To each his own

1 EXACTLY ! ! ! He had that line from Lawrence as his own personal MANTRA ! ! Do n't mind that it hurts David , do n't mind at all !

1 So he meets George Clooney in space ?

1 DiCaprio 's last line : `` I would rather die as a man than live as a monster . '' Or something along those lines .

1 I think the problem is that if you take all of the awards and put them together they do exactly what he described . Short Term 12 - 20 awards won on 30 nominations this year . Upstream Color - 3 wins on 12 nominations . A Field in England - 1 win and 5 nominations . The World 's End - 5 nominations . Iron Man 3 - 26 nominations ( including an Oscar nomination ) and 12 wins . We can pile another awards show on top I suppose ... but it 's not really going to do anything of worth despite the authors hopes . There are better ways to go about promoting lesser acclaimed movies than creating what would surely be an overlooked award in an already crowded season .

1 GQ magazine had a great article on Channing Tatum . He actually seems like a really cool dude ( he goes by Chan apparently ) . http : / www.gq.com / entertainment / celebrities / 201103 / channing-tatum-wild-one-jessica-pressler

1 10 / 10 Review Would read again .

1 Scott pilgrim vs the world

1 One of the highlights of the movie was really for me Faora-Ul , the female antagonist . I do n't think I 've ever seen such a display of power , and especially not from a woman . Loved every scene she had a part in really .

1 Because Shia Labeof is in it ?

1 Or you could man the fuck up and watch a movie . I promise you wo n't wind up sucking any cock unless that 's what you wanted to do in the first place .

1 Make that 3 other people

1 Footloose

1 I do n't think it was soley the molestation that caused him to be the way he was . He blamed himself for his Aunt 's death as well , and then started to secretly think he was glad she died . Then his best friend killed himself I mean , I do n't think the molestation alone affected him to the point of that 's the only reason he is the way he is .

1 Well , I was n't under the impression that this * was * a discussion thread , OP has n't even seen it . He just wants to know if it 's as good as the people say , probably in deciding whether or not to watch it .

1 No . I do n't .

1 Then ask where he got his fake teeth from

1 Comics do reboots and alternate universes all the time . Also the blockbusters fund the smaller indie / art projects that tend to fail to make money .

1 can you define the scale , from easy to difficult to understand ? I think many folks have quite varied interpretations of each movie . For example , on the surface many understand Inception , but a discussion on the ending and the totems allow for re-interpretation ( and many discussions ) of the movie . Primer is complicated but possible to be followed after one viewing ; better after many . XKCD sums it up nicely , http : / xkcd.com / 657 / I think Coherence plays itself out with some reasonably good explanation in the movie . The characters talk about the strange phenomenon and what is occurring . I 've watched it three times because there are subtle pieces and information you pick up after knowing the full story . Coherence is more on the difficult side of the scale , but not crazy complicated and difficult .

1 Those are pitiful-looking signs to feature in a publicity still .

1 Oh it made money ! That means it was high quality . Hence why Transformers 4 has an Oscar for best director .

1 [ No one ever wants to have sex with Chang ... ] ( http : / blogs.e-rockford.com / registerstarpodcast / files / 2011 / 10 / chang.jpg )

1 I like SLP because it was such a simple story told so well . It had all of the elements of a generic romantic comedy film yet the director made it all come together perfectly and somehow still feel fresh .

1 The Last Samurai is an alternate history account that massively summarizes the [ Boshin War ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Boshin_War ) and replaces the French generals that were hired to train the modernized army with Americans . I would n't recommend this film , in terms of historical accuracy , for much other than showing the rapid modernization of Japan in its culture and attitude , which I wo n't think would be very intriguing for a 12-year old . It also completely overlooks the fact that the shogunate was n't actually trying to serve Emperor Meiji by fighting against modernization ( when the shogun historically * invited * Westerners to Japan ) , but they were trying to suppress Meiji from exercising power of any kind , since the Emperor of Japan was a figurehead while the Shogunate held the real power for centuries . Also , I get the impression that a lot of people got the misconception that the samurai hated guns because of The Last Samurai , which was completely wrong when the [ Battle of Nagashino ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Battle_of_Nagashino ) indicates that the samurai embraced the gun just as another weapon of war . Especially since it took less training to use a firearm than the bow and arrow ( which is beneficial for training ashigaru soldiers , which make up the bulk of samurai armies ) . I would recommend Kagemusha over The Last Samurai for a portrayal of feudal Japan , though it is also historical fiction . The Last Samurai does , at least , visually portray 19th century Japan pretty well , aside from ninjas straight out of the kabuki theater ( can be rationalized since the ninjas attacked at night , where the black garb works ) .

1 > Actually , if you have a great gravitas or charisma , which in this case he does n't - apparently we all think he 's a fuckwit

1 You are reading into this WAY to much my friend .

1 The only thing I 'll disagree with is that this movie was so sci-fi that it did n't feel , really , like a superhero movie to me . The Avengers is SO superhero , it does that better than anything else I 've seen . For that , I think Avengers still hangs up there with GOTG even though it was n't quite as seamless .

1 Well I had just forgotten all about this movie , but I did really want to see it ! Thank you ! : )

1 I used Criticker.com . If you rank all the movies you 've seen ( which takes time ) , you get great recommendations and you have access to your own personal top lists by year , director , country , genre , etc . It 's pretty cool if you 're curious about that kind of stuff .

1 Not to you .

1 The Prince did serve as the protagonist , but the whole idea of the story was that he was there to see `` With eyes unclouded by hate . '' The very idea of that was not to lash out blindly or in vengeance , but to see what was going on . The boars were not inherently evil at all . They were `` strong and proud , '' which ultimately was their flaw . They rose up to defend their home which was being encroached upon . Hell , the `` demon '' from the beginning of the movie was a corrupted boar . Corrupted ! That form was not his natural state . The boars had to fall , to succumb , before `` becoming evil . '' And while you claim Prince Ishitaka is the `` clear hero , '' let 's not forget that he defied every governing body in the story , namely the Emperor ( denied him the Forest Spirit 's head ) , Lady Hiroshi ( took away Mononoke against her will , assaulted her , colluded with her enemies ) , the Wolf Goddess ( colluded with Iron Town ) . Therefore , I question his clarity as a hero , but not at all his station as protagonist .

1 Ready for some TMI ? The Broccolis seem to prefer actors who aren 's already movie stars outside of the UK , and when they decided to ditch brosnan , owen was already quite well known . In 1998 , after 'Croupier ' came out there was a lot of hype about Owen taking the role ( there were also wild rumors about the Broccolis considering and American , possibly even laurence fishburne for the role ... I shit you not . These were all big headlines at aintitcool.com back in the day ) but somehow Brosnan held on for a couple of more years , possibly explaining his lack of shock when Craig was cast . I think Owen 's now a bit old for the role ( but I though that about both Craig , too. , and that turned out fine , imho . )

1 but Will Smith * is * a one-man brand . `` Total Crap , starring Will Smith '' will make tons globally . If he wants to push through a project , and he 's willing to star in it and promote it globally , it will make money , and thus is a safe bet for a studio to produce . If you are a studio exec , and Will Smith comes to you with a lame / weird project that 's pretty much guaranteed to turn a profit , why would you * not * go ahead with it ?

1 Telling somebody else THEY WONT HATE IT and then someone else telling them there 's clearly the possibility they will hate it ... I just think you 're being a dick for no reason really . Every time someone says something it is n't implicitly their own opinion , they could be full of shit OR they could be conveying someone else 's opinion . Nothing is inherit in the things people say unless you 're incapable of reading into anything .

1 And hence why I think the whole idea of Akira being live action is in itself ridiculous . Let 's face it , even if somehow a director were to be able to get it live action , there would still be a lot of things wrong with it . One , it 's very hard to translate what is a six volume manga into a two to three hour film . Heck , even the anime itself had flaws . Two , being able to focus on all the specific characters . And let 's be honest , Kaneda and Tetsuo are not the only central characters in Akira . You have Kei , the Colonel , Kiyoko , Takashi , Masaru , Joker , Nezu , Ryu , The Doctor , Miyako , Tetsuo 's aid , and even Akira himself that you have to taken into account as far which actor and actress is playing which character . Everyone of these characters playing a significant role in Akira . And of course the fact that it 's a primarily Japanese saga which I agree provides the basis for Akira . Speaking of casting and production , this is where I think is being overlooked : rather than make it live action , why do n't Hollywood just have it go the animation route ? Think about it , Astro Boy was animated and yet it had Hollywood voice actors . Have Katsuhiro Otomo on board overseeing the animated production while WB goes out and find some Hollywood actors and actresses to provide voice over for the characters . Makes sense if you ask me . EDIT : When I meant by Asian actors , what I was trying to prove to whiskeytango55 was the point of Hollywood reluctant to take on unknown or lesser known actors in high profile films , especially non Western actors .

1 It 's a movie where the main plot is a superhero fighting a costumed villain and foiling his plot to destroy the city - I 'd say it counts as a superhero movie .

1 It 's fascinating watching * Jurassic Park * , and seeing how Spielberg deliberately crafted the film to utilize what he learned on * Jaws * , and avoided showing the dinosaurs as much as possible .

1 It 's an Attitude Era thing , which is pop culture , and is something that 's now even bigger that more of its audience back then is now older and on the internet . And having WWE getting a little bit more mainstream ( insert `` Did You Know ? '' fact about twitter here ) could n't be hurting it either .

1 He spent it all on snacks and drift cars .

1 Never forget Tarkovsky in general .

1 Your comments say either obvious troll or 12y / o .

1 It 's true . The prequels are a failure of writing and directing . When Ewan McGregor , Natalie Portman , and Liam Neeson all give awful performances in the same movie the actors do n't deserve any blame . The red letter star wars reviews are awful films but the points they make are spot on . Not one mention of bad acting .

1 Something can be worth watching but not be good . If you asked me to review Tron : Legacy I 'd give it 2 stars at best but I would also recommend people watch it if it was on TV or whatever just because it 's trippy , the music and visuals are great and CGI Jeff Bridges is a horrifying monstrosity that everyone should see . A critic 's job is to say whether it 's a good movie , not necessarily whether they enjoy it or had a good time watching it . Often those things overlap but in some cases they do n't and you end up with movies worth watching for certain elements that , overall , are not good .

1 As we saw he became quite a powefull man , he built a big business empire . It is plausible to think that money and power made him greeddy and arrogant . It made him uneasy that he spent his whole life building something so great to just die , to just disappear from the world and eventually be forgotten . Therefore he wanted to remain alive so that he can keep his name alive and well . Something similar happens in the real world . Many powerfull people only create Foundations at the end of their lives , when they know they do n't have many years left because the realize just that , they are about to die , their name and existence are about to be forgotten so they create Foudations with their names , to keep it to be forgotten .

1 It 's funny that you chose Citizen Kane over * How Green Was My Valley * , the film * Kane * lost both Best Director and Best Picture to that year . John Ford 's film has certainly lost its appeal , especially in comparison to Welles ' classic . I think you 're wrong on Citizen Kane though , mostly because the question OP has asked is flawed . You ca n't really compare a critics acclaim to that of the average audience-goer as you 're doing with Citizen Kane here - and that 's the only way you could justify the film not being appealing . If we 're comparing like-for-like , critics acclaim to the films critical or technical importance or appeal today then * Kane * simply can not be considered to have lost either . If we 're comparing OPs flawed comparison of critics and a modern general audience , I can see why you 'd think that and you 'd be justified . tl ; dr : Kane has perhaps lost its appeal to a general audience , but not to critics / directors / etc

1 I think what 's remarkable about `` The Powerpuff Girls Movie '' is that it 's one of the few superhero origin stories that does n't feel redundant or overly simplistic . You can tell the creators , instead of just making one long episode , instead took the premise of the show and used that as a jumping board for crafting a truly cinematic work that would fit in with a culture obsessed with gritty , violent boys ' stories with the pretense of emotion that instead just become cynical cash-ins . In fact , I 'd even say that I 'd rank `` The Powerpuff Girls Movie '' as good as any superhero movie I 've seen . It not only tells a compelling story , in which three little girls literally created in a lab are outcast but eventually accepted by an ignorant , prejudiced society ( it 's nice to have a science-fiction film where the message is n't `` Fear science '' ) , but also does so without the absurd violence and angst-ridden cynicism that is now associated with superheroes . The Powerpuff Girls are great contemporary characters , but they also harken back to a simpler time in which superheroes represented serious moral concepts without the morbid power trips . Plus , the Powerpuff Girls are great heroic female role models for both boys and girls in a genre where female parts seem woefully limited to Scarlett Johansson 's ass squeezed into leather or Anne Hathaway 's ass squeezed into leather . Great characters , great story , great execution . I love this movie , and I hope that , in time , it becomes appreciated as more than just a kids movie based on a television show .

Not to mention all the love it seems to get around here . A little unfair to discount it because you had n't personally heard of it . I think you might just be late to the party .

1 Basically.. he was taking his job too seriously , and the guys downstairs were mocking him for it . He was hired on as a creepy old guy to influence the decision of the kids . Based on meeting him , the kids would either proceed to the cabin , or turn back due to his creepiness . Those types of characters are staples in horror movies ( a prime example is in `` Leatherface : TCM III '' , when the couple stops at a gas station only to be confronted by a very similar character . ) There 's a scene later on in the movie where the new security guard questions the organization 's methods by saying they rig the whole situation . To which the older guy mentions that they rig it as much as they have to , but the kids ultimately make the decision to carry on past the harbinger ( Mordikai ) , and then eventually to go in the cellar . The Harbinger is just some dude who was taking his job wayyy too seriously , basically .

1 Blizzard 's cinematics in their modern games , whether it be Diablo 3 , Starcraft 2 or WoW have all been utterly fantastic in my opinion . To have an entire movie of with the amount of detail and realism that they have a history of would be pretty much amazing in my opinion .

1 He also gave the best performances in the entire prequel trilogy . Given the issues he relates , can you imagine how hard it must 've been for a less accomplished actor to perform ? And with worse lines ? It 's incredible the films did n't turn out even worse .

1 That whole move was like one long punch in the gut for me . It is pretty underrated .

1 I do n't know man , I know what you mean by `` he 's a different director '' but if Evil Dead 4 / Army of Darkness II is anything like Drag Me To Hell , I 'm all in .

1 You sure bamboozled him .

1 It was really a natural place to focus his talents . Much of the same muscle memory for whipping electric cord around on Formula 1 Grand Prix race tracks translates very well to jazz percussion . Also , the scene where Miles Teller ( playing the younger time-warped version of Mickey Rourke 's Whiplash ) explains that he left his electric arc reactor technology inside of his body to pulse electricity into his forarms and wrists to assist in his drumming speed was left out of the final edit . Apparently it was too much exposition for a movie that Marvel insisted be `` all about the action . '' You and I probably got it right away , being comic book fans and all , but I sometimes worry the general audience missed out on this important fact and it really cheated the MCU Whiplash out of some additional depth .

1 I do n't have much to add , except to agree entirely . Watching Citizen Kane now is a bit `` yeah , so ? '' . Then you remember it did everything first .

1 His recent career has been shit , but the guy went on to direct `` Three Amigos '' , `` Coming to America '' and `` Spies Like Us '' all after `` The Twilight Zone '' . Landis ' career really did n't begin to nose dive until the 90 's , and it could be argued that it had more to do with choosing to direct a lot of poor films .

1 This is awesome

1 I just did a quick check and it looked like only Shawshank was listed for under $ 5 . Besides unless Amazon Prime is available shipping would probably cost more than the sales tax on a $ 5 purchase .

1 I would say Mulholland Dr. and Elephant Man are two of his best films if not his two best . So , watch them before totally dismissing him . I 'd also suggest watching The Straight Story . I 've seen everything else Lynch has done . He has a decent eye for visual composition but that 's about where his skill ends . Acting in his films is problematic at best . What I like most about him is that his work feels very personal . No one else could make most of his films . Even the films of his that I outright dislike ( Wild At Heart , Fire Walk With Me , Dune ) , I respect them as something only he could do . There is something worthwhile about an artist who is dedicated to bringing himself or herself out in their work , being original and exploring what makes them interested . Not creating for money , but creating because they are inspired . That makes him respectable even if he 's not someone I enjoy that much .

1 While I think their exchange , and then with Channing Tatum in the office when he discovers what had happened , are easily the best parts of the movie , but there were other good ones as well . All of the scenes with the roommate , the Plainview Red Herrings scene , Jonah 's slam poem , when they do the whyphy , Nick Offerman , and some others were pretty great still .

It 's been well documented over the years that some aspects of comic books just do n't translate to cinema . I hope that Zach Snyder understands this for the next movie , particularly as he is going for the whole Chris Nolan approach .

1 No no , there 's a difference . Quite a few cultures burned dry shit . It 's largely fiber .

1 Hugo The Tree of Life The Artist The Intouchables A Separation Warrior The Descendents Midnight in Paris

1 He goes back to rescue Han . If Jabba had his palace anywhere else he probably never would have gone back .

1 That 's why I missed out on a lot of great movies starring DiCaprio . Got over myself a while back and now I love the guy .

1 He should get a cinematography oscar for that move .

1 I suppose so . It just seemed really odd that earth was so defenseless against an orbital attack .

1 It is also an Eastwood / Sheen movie

1 > Having watched only the Director 's cut of Blade Runner Ha . I wish I could say the same .

1 Horror movies are pretty much always profitable . They 're the only genre that does n't seem to be affected by cultural trends . Has always been strong , probably always will be .

1 My insurance company demands top billing too .

1 At least his face looks like he 's pooping to make up for that subtle imagery

1 i went into this movie blind knowing only a couple of lines quoted around here ( `` you 're an inanimate fucking object ! '' mostly ) and only watched the trailer for the first time over a year later . on one hand i really doubt that they 'd just forget to mention that the entire movie is done really really seriously and gets pretty damn dark , but on the other hand i do n't see how it 's possible to make a trailer so unlike the actual film on purpose . good god

1 He killed a character during a musical . This makes it much more easier for him to kill someone .

1 To me it was a story of him becoming the punisher , not actually being the punisher . Which is why I thought it was good .

1 I like the way you look at thongs . Edit : meant to say things , but I like it better this way .

1 Gleeson is a fucking legend .

1 Oh sweet lord ... That movie is all Wtf !

1 Waterworld is a masterpiece .

1 I 'm seriously excited for that movie .

1 I feel like you have n't looked at the rest of the cast list .

1 I would gladly buy a ticket to that movie .

1 My friends and I decided this and some of them consider it superior to gladiator .

1 I remember reading something about how Jada tried out for Trinity but did n't get it but made enough of an impression with the Wachowskis that they wrote a character and game for her in the sequels .

1 Give me a winter doodle !

1 9gag , I believe !

1 John Wick

1 Black folk can be clowns .

1 `` Perfectly sums up '' is quite the stretch . Both the article and interview were pretty ambiguous .

1 hmm yes , shallow and pedantic ...

1 Did they misbehave ?

1 It has to be that Halo intro song is just so good .

1 I just think this is kind of ridiculous . I think people would be saying the exact same things if the studio came out and said they had cast a fit but skinny male actor , e.g. Adrien Brody , for the part of Superman / Batman / Some other bulky superhero . For example , Andrew Garfield worked really well as Spider-Man , because Spidey is supposed to be skinny fit . More emphasis on the acrobatics , less on the brawn . But if they had cast Andrew Garfield as Thor or Cap , people probably would have had things to say about it .

1 So if I 'm not like you there 's something wrong with me ? Sigh

1 Because being outspoken and egotistical = raping a child .

1 I ca n't seem to find * Sold for Human Currency * on IMDB

1 Block Party , The We and the I , Is The Man Who Is Tall Happy ? , and Science of Sleep are all great movies .

1 I feel like the second time was an all or nothing attempt . Collateral damage was expected .

1 I 'm glad I was n't the only one who noticed that .

1 Thanks for the gold !

1 There 's no way those can produce enough milk for a newborn : x

1 `` Dear Hollywood , Please stop putting things that I do n't like in movies . Sincerely , Some guy on the Internet ''

1 Yea I do n't get it . Some movies he went `` it 's just trying to be a good time ! Do n't blame it for not being deep ! '' And then others he 'd go `` this movie focused too much on action and style and not on story or message ''

1 Apologies , figured it would be all over the web . I heard from a friend http : / www.aintitcool.com / node / 52448

1 I agree . Contact is one of my favourite films of all time and it has never bothered me . I definitely did n't think `` where 's the camera ? '' the first time I saw it .

1 Touch ? ...

1 Oh fucks yes . I kept waiting for something to * happen . *

1 I could even suspend my disbelief with that . I thought `` Sure , if you managed to direct a car into a helicopter , it would go down . '' But the whole thing with him being in a truck being chased by a harrier jet blew my mind . The harrier should 've taken him down in seconds , no contest .

1 He may have meant that he needed one with more than the usual..

1 What 's with your outfit , man ?

1 That 'll show them !

1 And the festival 's film selections are highly respected . They usually pick great films

1 I loved that the ending was the title of the movie ... yet I still did n't see it coming .

1 Stephen Colbert was a corespondent on the daily show before the Colbert Report .

1 As was pointed out above , it 's actually because the black hole is so huge . Spaghettification happens not because of the raw force , but because of the difference in force between the part of you farther from the black hole and the part closer to the black hole . Essentially , the steeper the `` gravity gradient '' , the more Spaghettification you 'll feel . In a supermassive black hole like this one , the event horizon is far enough out that the gravity gradient is still fairly shallow , and is not enough to rip Cooper apart . Ninja edit : A fun thing about gravity us that gravity itself can not crush you . All it does is accelerate you , and unless you 're close enough that you get Spaghettification effects , it 's affecting all your particles at the same time , so your whole form is accelerated intact and together towards the source . You can only be crushed if there is some structure that is held up against gravity that you are being dragged against .

1 I 'm not a parent .

1 When I watched Gravity , all I could think about was how much I wanted to rewatch Speed .

1 I 've told this story on Reddit before , but a friend and I were watching it in the theatre and a pair of 17 year old boys ( us ) were having a serious whispered conversation about walking out and never speaking of it again . We stayed till the end though . To be fair , we had to watch George of the Jungle immediately afterwards to have a mind purge .

1 Come on now , there are going to be about a billion and six threads about this movie in the next couple years , and your username will be equally relevant in all of them . Let / u / theonemanwhobeatyou have his moment .

1 Hell , the entire movie feels like `` Heat '' set in Gotham City . And I consider that a very , very good thing .

1 Sorry , but this is the way Copyright was always intended to work . You ca n't own a * concept * forever , even if you were the first to monetize it . Disney is the perfect example of why public domain is good for society . None of it would exist today if not for the public domain since most of their money was made reinterpreting public domain stories . Disney World , Disney Land , the Lion King , everything on the Disney Channel , Star Wars Ep . VII , etc. , and all the jobs that come with these projects would be nonexistent if they were n't able to reinterpret existing public domain stories like Snow White and the Seven Dwarves . And then consider the things that indirectly came about because of Disney . Without Disney Animation in the 90s , would we have Pixar and Toy Story ? Or all of the pop stars that started their careers on the Mickey Mouse club . Public domain has a long track record of creating tremendous amounts of growth because it encourages companies to create * new * works , even if they use an existing IP . On the other hand , copyright has a habit of preventing anyone from creating anything too similar for fear of being sued , and encourages protecting * old * works rather than creating new projects . This is why existing IPs so often make cameo appearances in other projects rather than doing something completely new and interesting on their own . The game becomes about licensing , not creating .

1 You could have just said in your response `` I hate Payne '' and saved us all the effort .

1 could n't disagree with this more . wonder woman , martian manhunter , shazam , and on top of that x-men ? ! ? ! so many great stories and characters to expand on !

1 Peter Erskine even commented on how badly the actor played when he was actually playing and not just miming . Everyone involved did great work on the film . It is n't necessarily a bad film just because Miles is n't really a Jazz drummer . Just in case everyone did n't know , Bruce Lee used a stunt double for his backflip in `` Enter The Dragon '' , Ralph Macchio did n't play his guitar parts in `` Crossroads '' , and Bill and Ted do n't really time travel in a phone booth .

1 Amazing film . Made me love her forever ( full disclosure : I liked Juno despite the hipster speak nonsense , and I liked her in inception ) .

1 My apologies , added spoiler tags . I falsely assumed most people that wanted to see it had seen it by now . Although I think it was clear about one sentence in that I was listing events in the film .

1 Awesome list ! And not a Batman or LOTR in sight . There are some serious masterpieces here , and excited about the ones I have n't seen yet ? Nice find !

1 fuck off , no way . Sean bean is great , but gibson was phenomenal . Just becuase he 's a crazy anti-semite does n't mean he cant act like a boss

1 `` Did you write a suicide note ? '' `` Yes . '' `` Is it dark ? '' `` Of course it 's dark , it 's a suicide note . ''

1 I 've watched it twice . Once in the cinema . I sort of kind of liked it that time , but was pretty bored and largely unimpressed . I originally thought it was just because I was super excited about seeing it . I watched it again a few weeks ago and I was just annoyed at the whole thing . Things I did n't care about on the first viewing pissed me off a whole lot the second time around .

1 oh hey a movie about alcoholism and I 'm sitting here at 6:26am drinking a beer after waking up at 3am , fantastic

1 I know . I 'm a mad Star Wars geek .

1 Oh , most assuredly ! However , I 'm pretty sure that while I was hauling ass the hell outta there , I would be trying to wrap my brain around what I was seeing / whatever . SK generally has his characters doing the same . He uses internal dialogue and retrospection to show the wtf reaction .

1 One could argue that * Constantine * is about finding the Spear of Destiny - the one that killed Christ on the cross .

1 Meh , why would n't you . My packed theater was 85 % black , but the movie is essentially a delightful romp about a slave rising up and killing a shitload of evil plantation owners . I think it would be a lot more awkward to be the guy not laughing .

1 Definitely ! The design of the one ship with the chapel gave a big 40K vibe too

1 But only after the war . The Great Dictator was a hit , and it was nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actor for Chaplin .

1 I agree , but it was just the targeted fanbase that probably shot it into pretentiousland . I liked when he was watching the herd of buffalo ( ? ) and his eyes welled up with tears .

It was pretty powerful and had already been out since about 88 and judging from the fact John and Thomas Knoll worked at ILM I 'm almost certain the `` Industrial Light & Magic 's Photo Shop '' they refer to is the application not a literal workshop .

1 Ron going blind was one of the funniest parts of the movie IMO . I mean it did n't have the biting commentary of the making fun of sensationalist news bits , but I got a ton of laughs out of that as well as the shark bits that came with it . Anyone who loves the first Anchorman should know to expect half of it to be completely absurd and stupidly ridiculous comedy rather than only satirical and allegorical . Either way , to each their own . I just think much of the wide hate on this site can be attributed to the reddit hive mind , as with most strong opinions on reddit .

1 It never stops surprising me that some people do n't realise that you can scan film at any resolution that pleases you . It 's no different from still photography . Film has been HD since the birth of cinema . Anyway , simply scanning something in high resolution has nothing to do with restoration . Some films need to be restored and some ( even very old ones ) do n't , beyond basic minor cleanup .

1 In terms of recognizable ( to a general audience ) female superheroes ... they 're mostly members of the X-men . Now obviously the wildly successful 7 movie series is somewhat responsible for that , but the point stands . I want a Captain Marvel movie also . I just think he 's saying a Shadowcat movie would be easier .

1 Then do n't , no one is insisting that you do . However , if you 're being SHOT AT by someone intending to kill as many people as possible , your least concern is the person trying to defend you . Statistically , you 're as likely to be shot by an officer of the law as a citizen with their license .

1 You mean to tell me if you had a lightning hammer and just saw the hulk stick a METAL plate into the worm ( ? ) , you would n't go 'OH THIS IS GON NA BE SWEET ' and bash it in ? The cap / ironman scene is a little more wtf , but you have to realize that tony is a brilliant / quick thinker with a supercomputer built into the suit . He also knows a lot about cap 's shield , so that scene was n't as unrealistic as it looked . I was disappointed that they never used any of the combos that they discovered in the forest .

1 We Canadians will provide the legendary `` Moose knuckle '' and `` Angry Beaver '' Jaegers

1 Ebert said it best about Craven directing it : > The movie was directed by Wes Craven , known for his horror films ( `` Scream , '' `` A Nightmare on Elm Street '' ) , and he may seem like a strange choice for this material . Not at all . He is in fact a cultured man who broke into movies doing horror and got stuck in the genre ; he 's been trying to fight his way free from studio typecasting for 20 years , and this movie shows that he can get Meryl Streep to Carnegie Hall just as easily as a phantom to the opera .

1 One is a beloved and fairly family friendly musical with a massive built-in fanbase and a foreign scope . One is a hyper violent slavery based spaghetti western . Obviously Les Mis will do better box office , especially at Christmas . That being said , Django was amazing . The most fun I have had at the theaters all year by far .

1 George Miller made Michael Bay look like a punk bitch .

1 As soon as the film started I was reminded of The Prestige from Christopher Nolan . That film starts with `` Are you watching closely ? `` , like the introduction to a magic trick , because the movie is about magicians taking revenge on each other . You had to pay close attention to things throughout the movie to truly understand it , whereas The Imitation Game was spelled out for you the whole way through . That 's not to say it was bad , but I felt generally mislead in that department like you did as well .

1 That reminds me of when mom was working and she waited on a table of all these women whom were on a girl 's night out . With the women was this one little girl who was the only one under 21 in the group . Anyways , the women all got Cosmos and the girl decided to order a Shirley Temple . So the girl would n't feel so left out , my mom made put it in a martini glass and made it look quite a bit like a Cosmo would be made just so the girl would n't feel so left out . She was so thrilled about it . ( the girl was making a big effort to look really grown up that night I guess )

1 Perhaps because I have no children is the reason I did n't care much for this film . I wonder what my opinion would be if I had been able to relate on that level .

1 I 'm surprised no one mentioned this sooner ! I 've always wanted to see it made into an equally ridiculous adaptation with audio and visual film tricks to echo the elements of the book . And maybe running subtitles throughout it displaying the 'footnotes ' juxtaposing the plot ?

1 He 's the main villain of the movie . No joke

1 Tron vs Ultron .

1 If I was a parent there 's no way in hell I 'm letting my children attend Hogwarts . That place makes the US Navy Seals training look like kindergarten .

1 Why ?

1 If I remember right , that 's the entirety of a YT video .

1 I think there definetly is certain Christian undertones , such as the theme of resurrection , the scene in the church , and I think the casino girl was wearing Jesus fish jewelry .

1 In the basement ?

1 It 's probably the most grounded in realism out of all the franchises , perhaps just as believable as Rocky and Godfather . Though , Legacy kind of retconned too much , making Bourne / Webb actually more like the first super soldier / captain america

1 Great movie . A cinema masterpiece . But Look Who 's Talking Now was where the franchise really hit the mark .

1 I do n't know who that is , but Brian Singer has never been convicted of raping anyone . He has been accused , but evidence came out that the accusers were n't even in the same state at the time and their lawyer dropped them , so ...

1 7 if you could the sketch of him in the toilet corridor in Tapper 's

1 Speaking of shooting stars , has anyone ever noticed that there is a shooting star in almost every Spielberg movie ?

1 What would indicate trolling to you ?

1 I 'm guilty of shit-giving . Gods of comics , forgive me .

1 So quit watching things about it .

1 psst ^^http : / www.reddit.com /r/moviescirclejerk /

1 Sadly , it is n't true .

1 To be fair , the film was marketed as `` Taken With Wolves '' . It 's an excellent movie , but it is n't the movie that was advertised .

1 Yeah , there was a lot of stupid shit that came as a result of compromising W3 's lore in order to fit a good MMO cookie cutter . The original Draenei became `` old ones '' or some shit . Blood elves being on the side of the Horde is laughable , and ANYONE being on the side of the Undead is even more laughable .

1 * The Diving Bell and The Butterfly * - Just watched this the other week , and was blown away by it . Really enjoying french film lately .

1 Make lots of stuff . Lots . Your first films will be awful . Everyone 's are . But keep going , keep going , keep going until you have something worthy of a film festival ( I 'd recommend short films , less risk ) . Then you 'll most likely get rejected . But keep going , keep making until you have something they 'll accept . Then pray for good luck that you 'll get noticed . If not , try again . It 's a long road .

1 I guess Sacramento 's did n't move on . Unless they just leave those up for show .

1 `` I understood that reference . '' - Captain America

1 Miyazaki is the greatest auteur living today . It is so easy to do simple generalizations in children 's films but he never underestimates a child 's intelligence . That 's is what sets him apart .

1 I bet Arrietty was awesome in theater . The sense of scale on that movie is amazing .

1 You would think if anyone had the juice to get it produced it would be Brad Pitt .

1 And cast

1 I watched Face / Off a while back with renewed interest in the acting and was amazed at how well they both performed .

1 Well its precisely the fact that they got well known actors . Hardly anyone would watch this predictable movie if it had a cast of nobodies .

1 Worst movie ever ! ! ! ! ! I can not stress enough how absolutely horrible this movie is .

1 It actually makes sense .

1 Alright , well round it up to 100 million then .

1 They promised to finance his dream project , a high art movie about a disabled woman obsessed with Spanish architecture .

1 The cut to the kid made me burst out laughing ! Because the sound was off and the kid stunned into silence , the mom tells him to shut it ( the TV ) off , thinking he was rotting his brain w cartoons , but you see the epic fight on the TV ... a nice bit of scripting , I thought .

1 Sorry I 'm in the UK and American ratings confuse me haha . It 's a 15 rating in the UK and I think it should be an 18 .

1 Suit yourself - personally , I 'd impregnate the shit outta her .

1 Another Battle For Endor ?

1 It depends . I 'm naturally skinny and it took me a roughly a year or so to hit my goal of gaining 35 lbs in a healthy way ; the only supplement I took was whey protein ( besides your usual men 's dailies , calcium , and such ) . I did this lifting every other day , running in between days , and ( probably most important ) putting roughly 4000 calories into me per day . I did this all around working 8-10 hrs a day . It was expensive , exhausting , but totally worth it . Call me naive as well , but assuming somebody has access to more time , trainers , and better nutrition / food , I do n't think it 's completely inconceivable to see some serious progress in a matter of months .

1 They are usually very expensive stunts .

1 Nuh-uh ! I do n't rack a disaprin !

1 You mean the dove flying away against a clear blue sky , just after it left his hands at night , amidst rain ? ; - )

1 Psychological , mind fuck , altered reality .

1 Here is more info on the clone FSV http : / fsv.sourceforge.net /

1 The two actors have very similar accents as well .

1 No Country For Old Men . They 've already shown they can handle his work brilliantly .

1 Even some of the otherworldly ones can be adjusted to be more realistic ( ie : Ra 's without the Lazurus Pit )

1 On Empire , was n't Kasdan also brought in to work on Leigh Brackett 's script after she passed away ? I 'm a longtime Kasdan fan and enjoyed many of his other non-genre screenplays ( Body Heat , Continental Divide , Big Chill , Grand Canyon ) . So , I 'm definitely hopeful about the script for Ep 7 and am sure he 's bringing his A-game on this one . I wonder what issues they had with Arndt 's ? I can only hope that someday ( maybe on the DVD ? ) they will include a copy .

1 Twist : `` I 'm sorry , Michael , I 'm afraid I ca n't let you do that . ''

1 the intro of that movie is so tight ! guy dragging a fucking coffin for a billion miles . Djangoooo !

1 I hope it 's * everything * like Good Will Hunting 2 : Hunting Season .

1 It 's from 3 days ago , I looked up the censor board chairman , Pahlaj Nihalani was seated 1 / 19 / 2015 . So that date is 2 / 11 / 15

1 Birth of a Nation is a horribly , horribly racist film . It 's also a stunning achievement that catapulted the medium forward and stands even today as an incredible work of art , often acknowledged as one of the greatest films in history . One does n't have to agree with a film 's message to enjoy it as a work of art . See : Leni Riefenstahl , Sergei Eisenstein , Jean-Luc Godard , etc .

1 Area 51 ?

1 I would really have like to have seen that , too , as well as the sequel ( s ) M. Night had in mind .

1 > Our income rates have n't increased Average yearly income in nominal dollars is twice what it was in 1984 . The price of a ticket in nominal dollars is twice what it was in 1984 . That does n't suggest that ticket prices are any higher in real terms .

1 That 's really a great scene . There 's a callback to it later , I believe . `` You really ARE an Elvis man '' or `` You 'll like it , you 're an Elvis man '' or something alone those lines .

1 I disagree with a great deal of what he put within this post , but he was n't really talking about Depth of Field , which usually pertains to how deep the focus is . He 's talking about , basically , a frame having three dimensions .

1 Un Chien Andalou is a fun film . It definitely has a sense of humor about itself . and it is only 20 minutes . http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=_DZ1x-xBtUM

1 SPOILER . The part where Cooper is floating in the tesseract . And hes dead center would have made a GREAT poster .

1 Lando

1 After Return of the Jedi

1 No all three films . In just one moment we saw the X-men finally . Different mutants working together as a team . Each having each others back and the trust that goes along with it . Combining abilities and planning tactically . No Wolverine going off alone and everyone else wandering around . And also it all looks fucking cool . More of this shit please .

1 The 9 star rating at IMDB does n't mean much at this point . I remember when Pacific Rim was at a 9 star rating for at least the first month after it was released . It is now at a flat 7

1 more like 8 years

1 Not to mention the Boomer , Tank and Witch from Left 4 Dead .

1 This is just a tribute to whatever Ben stiller movie op is trying to advertise

1 Gundam also has it beat by a very large margin . I 'm not sure how they 're defining `` spin-off '' , though . The problem with Sentai is that unlike Star Trek , the individual shows are seperate and have nothing to do with each other ( IE What happened in Zyuranger has no bearing on Dairanger or Kakuranger or Ohranger , etc ) . Even by that definition though , Gundam easily had it beaten by 2000 .

1 Not at the expense of ghost in the shell ! ! ! Go re watch Lost in Translation for your scarlett fix

1 Improvisation is great , but in moderation , and more importantly with good actors . I 'm sorry if you 're involved with this project , but it looks bad . Real bad .

1 Why thank you , I will .

1 Oh baby a quadruple !

1 TAKE IT BACK

1 > But there is POP hate in the world now and it 's trending Ah . I 've been wondering what to call that . Makes a lot of sense . People like to be contrarian and its satisfying to 'take down ' something big and beloved . ( eg . im 12 and I dislike popular music )

1 The problem is they 're basically firing bullets into a dark room , hoping they 'll shoot * something * . They do n't know what they 're aiming for , or where they should be aiming , or even if there 's anything to be hit at all . Plus there 's no way to verify whether they 're on the right track , or even if they 've hit something but not noticed . There 's too many variables and zero meaningful feedback .

1 Have you tried to go back and watch it with a different perspective ? If you go into a movie angry , odds are you 're going to come out the same way .

1 Must you correct him with such casualty ?

1 That 's why the character is not going to be in this current series . Unless they get him .

1 Sometimes I do n't think it be like it is , but it do .

1 Co-wrote . Around 2003 people were inclined to believe that Damon did most of the writing considering where both careers had gone . Affleck did a bunch of crappy movies after that and looked like a one hit wonder . Then Gone Baby Gone came and people did a double take when they realized it was written and directed by Affleck . His current string of quality is quite surprising and very refreshing .

1 I minimized the video about 20 seconds early and started reading the comments . As soon as I got to this it happened . Spot on . Spot on !

1 Depends on what you mean by hold up . I think it 's still relevant and works as an interesting character study . It 's excellent film studies material too ; it 's loaded with subtext and subtle imagery ( check out that modern art sculpture that sits behind the students in half of the shots , the big blob thing that has yet to take a form ) .

1 Ya , you ca n't beat the originals . I skipped this one when it came out . Knew it would n't compare .

1 Are we talking about Captain Marvel , Captain Marvel , Captain Marvel , Marvel Girl , Ms Marvel , Mr Marvel , Marvel Girl or Captain Marvel ?

1 I think they 're funny .

1 It 's clearly Dangerous Taiwanese Friends .

1 Well then she was a bitch .

1 People doubted Heath because he 'd never done anything even similar . Cumberbatch has done similar enough that I think some people can honestly say he brings the wrong energy to it . Before Dark Knight all I knew about Ledger is that he was awesome at being a friendly but tough and arrogant underdog . Lets all stop arguing and watch A Knight 's Tale , that movie is the shit .

1 `` Yeah I bet you love cock . You 're a cock expert . A cockspert . Tell me , whaddya like better , the shaft or the balls ? ''

1 For someone who is fairly thin to start with , that is quite a lot .

1 Hell , since we 're already on Commando , how about Bennett actually giving Arnold some competition during their fight ? I mean , for fuck 's sake , you look at Bennett and think he 's a line cook at the local diner . Then you look at Arnold . That part never made any sense to me .

1 My thoughts exactly . It fits well as the trilogy title but not as a single part of it . The Battle of Five Armies sounds like a Lord of the Rings title , so I like it a lot more .

1 Label your axes , people .

1 well thank go ... . Sweden for that

1 While the plot was weak and the depiction of the medival world was embarassingly small-scale , the effects on the dragons were amazing for the time ( mostly ... a few bad shots ) and Connery gives a solid performance . But if you disliked it , I can understand why . Maybe you 're a Juggalo and even twenty years ago when the movie came out you were annoyed Violent J did n't show up and no Faygo was drunk at any time .

1 Exactly . Many similarities can also be found with Don Quixote , does n't mean the works are identical .

1 /r/trashy

1 This is how I put it , and I was really looking forward to it , as was my wife who is not a movie buff at all . Even she turned to me halfway through and said `` The writing sucks , does n't it ? '' A script should not be that obviously bad to a casual movie-goer .

1 Vision / JARVIS wiped every trace of him from online before destroying all his bodies .

1 People who 've just had sex being carful to stay decent is irritating . It makes you aware that you 're watching them , so their not actually alone .

1 Too late . Any movie produced in India will henceforth be known as a `` Bollywood '' movie , much to the chagrin of nitpickers .

1 I was hoping How to Train Your Dragon would get a nod for original score to make up for the original film 's score losing to Social Network .

1 Yeah , it adds some complexity to the universe , I was just asking because I 'm sure there are novels out there and wanted to know if anyone had read any that explicitly mentioned another alien life form

1 My opinions have n't been progressive since the 1960s . Now it 's pretty much normal .

1 A show that rewards you for thinking vs a show that tells you when to laugh .

1 There is no Kenya , only Zuul

1 The difference between the two is that one of them rubs you the wrong way , while the other resonates with you in more ways than one . Both can have great ideas behind it , it all depends on how those ideas are executed in the script and direction .

1 The old man thought it was imporant ... whattime * snide smirk *

1 Might be easier to just buy the blu ray .

1 Harrison Ford seriously injured his back during the elephant riding scenes and was unavailable for five weeks . His double Vic Armstrong stood in for him in as many shots as they could get away with so production would stay on schedule .

1 Yeah man , Viva La Orangered !

1 I do n't know why people are so down on the Van Sant remake . You can argue it 's unnecessary , which almost all remakes are , but it was very well made and was certainly better than all of the other horror remakes out there which are almost universally transparent money-grabs . Vince Vaughan as Norman Bates was a bad casting decision though .

1 I read that in an article as well , somewhere around the time of the movie commando ; sorry I do not have a source other than my failing memories and shortcomings .

1 I 'm like 85 % sure that they already used that footage in one of the production diaries that Peter Jackson does , so I was doubly confused .

1 What are you talking about ? Any movie with such a gritty song like `` good vibrations '' by marky mark and the funky bunch is super dark . Trust me , bro . I 'm in the biz .

1 Amy Adams was in The Office for an eps or two and they referred to her as `` hotter Pam ''

1 Right but Sam 's immortal . It 's an unfair comparison .

1 Yeah , like Truman Capote ... fucking creep that Truman Capote .

1 Too bad a black widow character and Hawkeye character movie are both unnecessary and sound worse than their other movies .

1 As a Netflix subscriber living in the United States who now has the urge to watch this movie ( due to this post ) , I can say that this is really making me want to pirate this movie .

1 > gives me the impression that the film needs to use his star power because the film does n't have any more redeeming qualities Hit the nail on the head .

1 Yeah , come on . We live in the world . In the world things are made by companies that brand their things .

1 It 's still a Captain America movie , despite the huge cast .

1 So uhh , y'all goin ' campin ? ! * heeheeheeheehee *

1 The Matrix . When it first came out my mind , body and soul were blown away by what I was seeing .

1 It 's as if he reached really deep into his ass to come out with something .

1 It was OK . Really well filmed and good for a laugh .

1 Absolutely loved Argo . One of my favourite films of last year . I have to say I did n't / do n't care about its accuracy , I just assumed it had been `` Americanized '' going in and read what actually went down afterwards . It never claims to be a documentary , so IMO its one of those films you should enjoy for what it is , a great piece of storytelling .

1 I think Carrey has started to get his credit for dramatic acting though .

1 > `` Black '' shows have a very predictable type of humor / drama . This can cause a problem when you begin avoiding that type of humor and drama . Could it be that as you 're not a part of Black American culture you view it as an outsider - in a simplistic , stereotyped way ? If somebody said what you just did about `` White '' shows , we 'd all by crying foul that they did n't understand the diversity and nuances of White American culture . Granted there might be a lower output and lower audience for 'Black ' programming , but there 's a huge difference between the * Fresh Prince * and * The Wire * .

1 As someone who did some editing in school I think it would be both a nightmare and a dream . Malick discovers his movies in the editing room and one of the most exciting things about editing is seeing a sequence come together and really start to work . For the Thin Red Line the amount of footage was huge and going through all that had to be hard but when the movie starts to work there can be no other feeling like it .

1 forrest gump is great , but it is n't exclusive to viet nam .

1 I believe we should be encouraging everyone to raise their level of collective taste and thought toward movies , not pushing the thoughtful discussion to another subreddit . I work 12 hours today and come home to see the top three posts are `` I just watched XYZ '' posts . Recommendations are fine , R / movies is a great place to get them ( sometimes ... ) , but it seems like most transient users just like to upvote the acknowledged existence of movies and actors `` Bill Murray ! I do n't even care if you have something to talk about , have an upvote ! '' I want to see [ /r/movies ] ( /r/movies ) reach the point where everyone is n't bitching about Hollywood and circlejerking the same topics , but one where people are actually trying to figure out the next step in movies , and why some movies work and some do n't , and challenging the notions shown to us by the current crop of top filmmakers . Someone tell me something great about Wages of Fear , please . Or let 's try to figure out why * Skeptic * and * Switchback * were n't accepted by audiences . Why has no one heard of El Crimen Ferpecto ? What about it does n't make it commercially viable in the states ? What kinds of narratives are left to tackle in the horror genre ? Why are the subplots always relationship drama / detective stories , instead of the high school sports team trying to reach the championship but a serial killer is offing them one by one- but they win the championship at the end ? Conceptually , why does n't that work ? / rant . I 'm tired . Passing out now .

1 My guess is because he had to buy so many . If he did n't purchase in bulk ( 10,000ish ) , Alfred said people would get suspicious .

1 I think Into Darkness would have been a better film if they 'd left the Khan reference out . It really added nothing to the film .

1 You are not alone . There are some people out there that have Die Another Day as a better movie than QoS . In a perfect world , if there was no writers strike and better direction from Marc Foster , then this film could have been of the best Bond films .

1 We figured it out , guys . We really ca n't blame James Franco anymore .

1 I was n't sure what movie it was . I did n't work there at the time . But as many as 10 guest passes was not worth leaving to them .

1 Congratulations

1 thanks for the NSFW tag ... boss is filling out my write-up form as I type this .

1 Canada huh ? Almost made it .

1 It was written and directed by Guillermo del Toro , whose movies range from `` pretty darn entertaining '' ( Hellboy ) to `` positively transcendent '' ( Pan 's Labyrinth ) . So it 's not just a `` giant robot vs . monsters '' movie . It 's a `` giant robots vs . monsters '' movie by a filmmaker with a demonstrated ability for greatness .

1 > I consider myself very empathetic Here 's a hint . When you call the portrayal of actual events that led to a persons death `` laughable '' - you 're not empathetic at all . Just pathetic .

1 > Our voters were asked to submit ranked , 50-title lists of the best films commercially released in the U.S. between 2010 and 2014 . ( This means that movies that were distributed abroad before 2010 were eligible ; our oldest title had its world premiere in 2007 . ) The resulting list of 100 films will appear in three parts : 100 to 51 today , 50 to 21 on Wednesday , and the top 20 on Thursday . There 's your answer . It 's not the staff ranking the films , it 's an aggregate list derived from all readers surveyed , and A.V . Club 's readers tend to have pretty diverse tastes .

1 I had no idea about this . AWESOME .

1 It 's a good analysis , and one that 's not often acknowledged in films , books , or tv . Sentience * should * , theoretically , be respected regardless of race ( black , white , human , Asgardian , Frost Giant etc ) .

1 The lion is the centre part of the MGM logo

1 falling off the deep end ... and i guess a kind of `` you are the company you keep '' vibe too .

1 I interviewed the director of The Raid earlier this year . His approach toward action is commendable ; in the sequel , apparently , there is a car chase where the main guy fights five dudes at the same time . He said , `` We 're still trying to figure out how do it without killing anyone . ''

1 Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I have the Key is one of the best movie titles ever .

1 > Male SS probably did n't even recognize herself No , he did . He knew immediately who it was when he turned to face her . That 's why he said `` you 're beautiful , someone should have told you that . ''

1 Khaaaaaaaan !

1 An individual concept artist 's personal style does n't have to exactly match the Disney ( tm ) mold . These guys get paid to come up with a lot of ideas and the preferred ones get tweaked during development .

1 i dont get the hate for the first hobbit movie verus the love for the second . The first one at least has character development , and change . Its not all action like the first one , we actually get to learn about the drawfs and hobbits . And the second on has that werid relatioship ,

1 God young De Niro makes me question my heterosexuality .

1 Its an amazing movie , I was blown away by the depth the movie had .

1 Best movie ever !

1 The thing that I noticed from time to time during this film , is that it lacks a certain original creativeness to it . When I saw it for the second time it kind of seemed like it was making fun of all cliches in space opera films , but it did n't add any originality or sustenance to keep audiences entertained entirely . Sure , it 's great to watch , it 's funny , it 's crazy , but it will never compare to the original space operas ( read : Star Wars and Star Trek II ) .

1 A prequel movie with Shepard on Akuze would make a great movie and much better than a straight adaptation of the first game . And Matthew Fox needs to be Shepard .

1 Jon Dies at the End .

1 it 's also important to remember that we 're just getting a taste of their lives . a lot happens behind the scenes that is implied .

1 > implying people are allowed in /r/movies if they * have n't * seen Interstellar

1 Hehe , dong .

1 Agreed . I did n't feel like a human being for about a week after this one .

1 To be fair , she 's perfectly cast for the role of Darcy . Now creating that character in the first place ...

1 In The Village , after they reveal that [ the monsters are just dudes dressed to scare people from leaving ] ( / spoiler ) there 's another scene attempting to scare the audience when we all know it 's just a halloween costume . God damn M. Night slamashlong , I fucking hate you .

1 exactly why i came here..i am still surprized , being a huge batman fan , that i cudnt watch the entire movie .

1 Each film on IMDb has a section called `` Parents Guide '' where it gives a pretty thorough breakdown of all of the violent / sexual / frightening scenes in the film . For example , here is their run down of Die Hard . http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0095016 / parentalguide ? ref_=tt_stry_pg

1 The idea is that you ca n't just fly into mordor when it 's full of orcs with bows , not to mention the nazgul led by the witch king . Gandalf could fly in at the end because the ringwraiths were destroyed ( when the one ring had been ) and most of Sauron 's armies had been scattered .

1 What a strange sentiment

1 No theres one black man that Marvel has not yet employed ... He stole the show in The Dark Knight , and was the first black man to portray a comic book superhero . MICHAEL JAI WHITE ! ! ! ! ! !

1 No .

1 I love 2012 . It 's my favorite disaster flick . Weak third act but so much fun .

1 And its not that bad

1 You would call snowpiercer light hearted ? I felt emotionally drained after watching it

1 It was actually made out of beef schlong .

1 Pulp Fiction came out 19 years ago : ) The Avengers Amazing Spiderman Iron Man ( I got tired of high drama and reality so now I just watch Superhero movies mainly : ) )

1 Tarantino , why oh why did n't you hire him as Calvin Candie ?

1 Other than being complicated it 's very minimal and understated . 'Pretentious ' seems like the laziest form of film criticism that people aim at something they do n't like , you can accuse Primer of being over-complicated certainly but how is it trying to appear smarter than it is ? What other time travel film is more intelligent ?

1 we do n't speak of that . along with halle berry as catwoman .

1 Photo from the set of Giant , most likely .

1 It did not . His reflexes were too fast . He caught it .

1 Thank you !

1 You 're so cool you feel the need to share your coolness with others . Man you must be the coolest internet kid ever .

1 You might be confusing Todd and The Book Of Pure Evil with Tucker and Dale VS Evil . * Todd * was a Canadian TV show .

1 > Let me know what you guys think ! I think you went in with a ton of expectations , including that women are to `` be scored '' ( as you put it ) . The trailer : Why are so many here trusting marketing and advertising ? I come here to find out what the film is - not just people 's expectations of it ; ) How many times do you have to be fooled by trailers ? > They gave you really no reason to like Wahlberg and root for him . I quote Wikipedia description of The Stranger book : `` Meursault explains to the reader that he simply was never really able to feel any remorse or personal emotions for any of his actions in life . '' sounds like the film did exactly what it wanted for you . Not a person you are gong to feel emotion for - but a painting you may recognize . > I really wanted to see Wahlberg repair this relationship at least some how , which just adds onto the list of why you just can not like his character at all . Way too focused on the actor , not the story , and not the emotions inside all of us - even if we are n't acting them out in the same way . Jim Bennett has Seenit , Doneit , Hadit with the cute university girls and his mother - and is going to follow the one tiny thread of joy he finds in his life ... gambling . And he does n't even seem to enjoy that very much . He seems to enjoy the borrowing . It 's almost like Jim is being a performance artist . The money is just a prop , and he sees a story he wants to live .

1 Wait you feel that the whole trilogy had an unoriginal name and was a weak finish to a brilliant trilogy ?

1 Exactly . I was debating it with my girlfriend afterwards and we decided that every single thing Bradley Cooper did after the shooting was fueled by his need to feel `` right '' again .

1 No , Sir . The OTHER car !

1 they 'd spend more money making fake reviews

1 `` SFX ''

1 Period piece ? No . Baz Luhrman 's adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald 's masterpiece ? Yes . Not that I agree with the choice , but it 's just Luhrman 's style .

1 how does that rating compare to the rating for the original movie ? either way the best parts of the movie were in the trailer and they were edited in such a way that it made those jokes seem funnier out of context than they were in the actual movie .

1 I know right ? I remember how John Carpenter fucked up the Thing From Another World when he remade it in 1982 .

1 Yea , I never got the feeling it wanted to be historically accurate in any way . It just used the Moulin Rouge and the culture as the backdrop . Nothing wrong with that .

1 Yea , I have no idea why people are saying in this thread that it was his worst movie in terms of acting . People need to calm down with the whole `` bashing great actors who are great for great reasons , but look at le under-appreciated genius that is & lt ; insert obscure actor here > ''

1 I do n't want to sound like a dick or nothin ' , but it says on your chart that you 're fucked up , uhh , you talk like a fag , and your shit 's all retarded .

1 A similar claim could be made about R2 and 3PO being useful sidekicks . You 're right , Short Round and Willie ( especially ) did come off feeling more Jar-Jar .

1 I think when they say 'young kids ' they 're talking about kids who are like 15 and up . Pretty much all of the DC Animated films are PG-13 and since they 're targeting a smaller market and are animated , they end up getting away with more sex and violence than DC 's live action films .

1 Townes ' version is a cover . A superior cover , but still , the rights belong to the Stones ( 's manager ? )

1 Making movies is boring , even when it 's not digital .

1 Honestly , next time if some one does that just bark out , `` Take your phone outside ! '' Project your voice over the movie so the whole theater hears you -- the crowd will side with you and the person will either do so or get off their phone . Stupid assholes ... and we even have to sit through numerous reminders onscreen prior to the movie to shut your phones off .

1 Because Redditors do n't like links . They like pictures .

1 Is n't a clich ? just a trope that 's been done to death ?

1 Right , but it 's just shown for a single frame , upside down . Really creepy .

1 I understand your feelings . In general , it bothers me when you can tell that everybody in a given movie has been `` dressed '' by the same wardrobe people and makeup artists : Clothes that look like they 're all from the same closet , haircuts that all have a generic sameness , etc . That 's what is giving me a few misgivings about the Trailer for the new * Mad Max . * Even though Miller 's back , the costumes all look the same , the makeup looks too `` unified '' among all the characters , the cars all look too shiny and like they were turned out by the same custom auto shop . The original movies were especially cool because of how oddly detailed and idiosyncratic was every element of the costuming and design-work . I hope I 'm wrong , but that 's my first impression .

1 Similar , but not the same .

1 Talk to your store manager first , I do n't know if tuition reimbursement covers going to the physical campus since I 've only heard of the online program being covered . But for the tuition reimbursement , should be self explanatory . You pay upfront for the classes , when you pass the class for that quarter you get reimbursed . Half for freshman and sophomores and 100 % for upper classmen .

1 It 's RDJ . The crotch wears out fast in whatever he 's wearing .

1 It 's a dry depressing sort of comedy that makes you want to drink a martini and then slit your wrists .

1 This reminded me a lot of a similar scene of Jekyll in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen .

1 I 've made a huge mistake

1 I feel like the Onion has been * sub * -standard in their attention to detail .

1 I heard the entire movie was reshot at some point .

1 `` Well , this website that I found when I googled & lt ; name > net worth says this celeb has this much money , so it seems legit '' Nevermind that they just pull numbers straight out of their ass

1 He even did a draft or so of the screenplay , as he has co-writing credit on the film .

1 Yeah because the engineers are just going to welcome her when she arrives .

1 And honestly , I did n't expect them to make a sequel either , so ... the awful tagline works ?

1 Inglourious Basterds

1 working at a rental store that rented porn in addition to all the latest triple A titles , Secret Window was ruined for me by a couple in their mid-50 's who strolled in one Sunday morning around 11am . They asked for help finding it on the shelf , so I walked them to our massive wall display and handed them a copy . The woman looks to her husband and says , 'Well , now that we have something for the kids , lets go get something for ourselves.. ' and they walked past me to the porn section in the back of the store . Still creeps me out to this day . I know everyone watches porn , but for the love of all things Holy , do n't discuss it with your neighborhood rental guy . And Secret Window for the kids ? What ?

1 All the bitches know Mr. Calrissian .

1 I do n't care what anybody says . This is one of my favorite movies ever . I also like that it touches the topic of Incest ( one of the last taboos ) . It also still manages to make the the main characters redeemable , despite their quirks . It was a very sobering movie .

1 The Spongebob Squarepants Movie

1 I too like some movies that I know are terrible : Baseketball and Beerfest come to mind .

1 It 's a measurement of distance which makes it even more impressive .

1 no way , baby bird .

1 They would 've spoiled it In the trailers anyway

1 [ Birdman might actually win . ] ( http : / variety.com / 2015 / film / news / the-lego-movie-wins-producers-guild-animated-award-1201414193 / )

1 That would have been interesting if Wes Anderson actually did direct the Mortal Combat movie .

1 So how do you feel about pirates and monarchies then ?

1 Seamen . A tube full of seamen .

1 I would be pretty happy with another Baron Munchhausen , thank you very much .

1 [ Relevant Simpsons clip ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=nu0R96OZy6w )

1 It was right before . He snapped his neck to keep him to from killing them . I 'm almost positive it shows them after he does it .

1 I disagree . We 've come to the point now where digital can look exactly like film . Whether it be `` grain '' control in post , lighting equivalence , lenses etc . ARRI 's Alexa system used with Anamorphic lenses and lit properly will look like film .

1 see , the thing about satire is that it only works if its funny .

1 What disappointed you ? I thought it was a solid film . Sure , the twist halfway through threw me for a loop but I certainly enjoyed it even after that .

1 My husband still tries to do this , and he says , `` Look ! I 'm in Dennis the Menace ! ''

1 To be fair , he went from calling Megatron `` Brother '' in the first movie to ganking him in the back in cold blood after shooting Sentinel Prime in the face while he begged for mercy . Which is to say , this Optimus Prime is fucking off the rez . Although after watching humanity try to exterminate your entire species after you sacrificed their chance at salvation in order to save humanity , it 's easy to get irritated .

1 I remember about 30 min in thinking how much fun I was having . Seriously entertaining and undersung

1 yeah that 's annoying

1 This should be the top comment . The long lines , the enthusiasm , the pissing of pants when the Star Wars logo popped up on the screen for the first time in 20 years ... Then the film started . Then ended . Then we all walked out , in a daze , unable to talk about it at all because it was so ... Much.. Worse.. Than.. Expected .

1 I dont want to give too much away , but poppins represents a family member attempting to get her straying family back on track . Edit : i think it would be more accurate to say that the mary poppins story repeesents her faniliy 's struggle with the father . So it 's not a frivalous whimsical story to travers , quite the opposite .

1 The Apartment is still one of my favorites .

1 I 've seen enough alien movies to know that if you ever see that thing , it 's best to just blow your own head off .

1 The `` I ca n't believe Gareth actually said that '' Tim look

1 I do n't know about Renaissance but we 've certainly had some great gems recently . Sinister was the first movie in a long time that really scared the shit out of me and impressed me ( even without the horror ) . Mama was great . I 'm a little bias when it comes to anything that Guillermo Del Toro has a hand in but this was awesome . Chastain was great in her role , even the child actors . The creature 's movement was so well thought out ( they used a young man with a condition that makes him very lanky ) . The subtlety of the jump scares . Drag me to Hell was another good one at the beginning of this new wave . I 'd welcome a renaissance though . Horror needs some love .

1 you a word .

1 Are you `` Internet retarded '' or just a troll ?

1 Always a classic . [ Sticky Fight is cute too ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=GcupMTe-_08 ) .

1 Do n't you know that the first rule of Fight Club is to never shut the fuck up about fight club ?

1 Agree . I saw the first Star Wars flick when it was first released in '77 and became a huge fan . I was 4 years old . : O

1 Its so harsh , the bleak feel that maybe the creature will freeze and one day get another chance . I loved it .

1 Entirely agree . I think it 'll set a lot of people up for disappointment but on the other hand , I guess it 's a smart business move as it pulls in those who only cared for Dragon Ball 's fights . A shame but a move that makes sense .

1 I actually think the breathing trailer pumped me up even more and then AotC happened ... https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=kDpCXtD_i84

1 She kinda annoyed me . I liked Xenia Onatopp better .

1 I 'm familiar , great movie . Thanks !

1 Just looks like he 's getting a bit older to me

1 I have to ask , how do you not like Paul Rudd ? I did n't know that was possible . He 's like the most likable human being .

1 It 's a comedy , not a thriller .

1 He probably is , which is the funny thing .

1 You know what they call a Bloody Mary with no booze in it ? A Bloody Shame .

1 Best quote I saw was `` Dazzles the eyes but lacks heart and story ''

1 Van Helsing was an unnecessary character in Van Helsing ?

1 Not cheesy , just different . If that is cheese then Reeve 's outfit would have been extra cheese but he will always be my favorite Superman !

1 Correction - everyone uses google .

1 His name is James , James Cameron The bravest pioneer No budget to steep No sea to deep Who 's that ? It 's him ! James Ca-me-ron

1 You and me both , hombre . I was ready for some witty mocking of the industry he works in

1 Thank you . Reddit hugged the site to death and I was looking for a mirror .

1 Except that in a hilarious twist of fate , that bizzare 3D file navigation system was a real prototype unix system called `` FSN '' , or `` file system navigator '' . [ Seriously ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=p6ajJNq8b1Q ) .

1 2 was already pushing it . 3 is just execrable .

1 Too bad it was n't ... I was really enjoying the intro scenes . The movie got too strange for me after that . I did n't enjoy it much at all .

1 BOTH OF THEM GODMAMNIT !

1 Iv never met Spike Lee so I 'm sure he would n't mind if I went and illegally downloaded all of his movies . Since I never met him I do n't owe him money for anything he creates right ?

1 Yea . In a scene like this though , it 's only their upper bodies in the frame so they could just have him stand on something .

1 He 's an English actor .

1 1 . Have Kids 2 . Practice 3 . ? ? ? 4 . Profit

1 That 's what you could have said about Cowboys vs . Aliens . Director of Iron Man + Han Solo + James Bond + sci fi genre mashup . But look how that one turned out . It 's not a slam dunk for the studio or anything .

1 I think Rowling still owns the film rights . She 's pretty protective of her IP rights .

1 Would n't that be something . Come full circle .

1 HOW COULD ANYBODY DOWNVOTE THAT PICTURE . YOU MONSTERS .

1 When I return , I shall be a Cabin Man

1 Holy fuck , I thought they were exaggerating , but the reality is much worse . I 'm starting to think this shit is posted just to give that subreddit content .

1 The actual name for their species is `` Tuscan Raider '' .

1 I 'm personally conflicted . I had little censorship on films and music . But it always came with talks from my parents on right and wrong , and what is and is n't healthy or appropriate behavior . I saw dirty work at age 10ish ( long story ) but I knew my personal limits and I feel I handled things better than my peers . That being said , would I let my own kids watch what I watched . I probably would n't . It 's complicated .

1 Wow I loved ILD . I just loved the slow pace , and the main character .

1 Jesus fuck that 's horribly wonderful . Or wonderfully horrible . Not sure .

1 Seriously . Why is this the top post right now ?

1 Yeah-a little surprised that a gossip girl actor is considered better known than Nathan Fillion .

1 Ah yes , Saturday .

1 Cool beans

1 Harsh , but fair .

1 unless darth_xavier thought the title was `` every frame of JP '' the fps does n't have anything to do with it .

1 You do n't say Chineses !

1 Brilliant .

1 Stranger than fiction , fight club , royal tenenbaums

1 Oh shit so am I

1 Its more how the plot unfolds that makes it a good movie . Things are hidden from the audience leaving us questioning characters and their motives all the way through .

1 No . We can stop reinforcing the air of realism for Batman now .

1 It 's not . But it 's still good .

1 I really hope including Batman does n't mean that WB does n't have confidence in MOS as a franchise that can stand on it 's own .

1 `` Asshole '' and `` shithead '' are good places to start . Sometimes I like to throw out something odd like `` pus-balloon '' .

1 IF YOUS A TRUE BELIEVAH THROW YA HANDS UP IF YOUS A TRUE BELIEVAH THROW YA HANDS UP IF YOUS A TRUE BELIEVAH THROW YA HANDS UP

1 God , those last 30 seconds are just perfection .

1 You 'd need a trilogy ... .at least .

1 This is interesting . It 's kind of neat to see it from that perspective . A director remaking a film apparently to pay off investors , then coming back years later to let someone else remake his film again , breathing new life into the franchise . I mean , he and Bruce could also just want a new beachhouse , but it 's nice to think they 're in it for the spirit of the thing .

1 Hae Lee shit that was amazing

1 And a good example of a non-horror found footage movie . I 'm a little disappointed we have n't seen found footage branch out more into other genres like this one and `` Project X '' with comedy .

1 But he was n't really a comedian who found drama . He was a dramatic actor who found comedy .

1 In the leaked script , there 's a shot of the Deadpool action figure from Origins and Deadpool says in voiceover something along the lines of `` When I heard about this , it was the worst day of my life . '' and then the camera pans back and it 's a kid playing with it in a hospital ward , before a doctor calls Wade in and tells him he has terminal cancer . I do n't remember the scene exactly , but that was the vibe .

1 He tainted the water , then just worked his ai-magic from there and put together 2 by 2 . Or maybe they all saw her do the c-section through the ships securitycamras and already know what had happend , then david told them what he had done and they all put 2 by 2 together .

1 When they were explaining the backstory behind the human business I whispered to my friend `` ooh ! I know this one ! Then the robots take over and put everyone into a virtual world ! ''

1 Yes .

1 Fuck me , It 's called The Ninth Gate

1 Not even , though .

1 I would like actually like to see Topher Grace 's version that he knocked it down to 85 minutes

1 That was a good one I had forgotten about.. time to see it again.. also in that vein : Dark City .

1 so true , I enjoyed him so much more than I expected .

1 This . It took George Lucas years to finish the script for The Phantom Menace , and everybody hates it . He only had a year or so for The Empire Strikes Back , and we got one of the best films of all time . It 's no guarantee for a good film of course , but it does n't have to be a bad sign either .

1 holy shit , man .

1 Funny , I feel the exact same way about people who feel nothing about entrapping , torturing , and enslaving others . No heart , ice water circulation..aliens .

1 It needs to be pointed out more .

1 Someone like Bale is n't what you 'd call an 'icon ' the way Pitt is though . I just think he exists in a unique place of having the profile of a Cruise or a Smith without being that type of actor . Yeah most actors do work as part of an ensemble , but the weird thing about Pitt is that you * think * of him as a front and centre leading man , until you look at his body of work and realize he kind of is n't . I guess that 's more what I 'm trying to say .

1 In TOS there is no exclusive role of First Officer . The captain picks one of his officers to be his first officer but they still maintain the responsibilities of their original post .

1 Yeah it was a good time

1 I was going to mention this . In that scene he slaughters well over 100 people

1 Hey , great idea . I 'll have to set up some AMAs over at /r/Burlesque .

1 oh yeah . the scene where gene hackman makes his hicks take a tape measure to the arena court is one of my favorites from any sports movie .

1 Trivia : That line was improvised after Matthew Lillard spent an hour working himself up while the rest of the crew took a lunch break .

1 Upvote for Stanley Tucci . He was great in that movie .

1 Pretty sure there are more than like 40 time travel movies . Silly clickbait titles .

1 A big part of it is a take on G. W . F. Hegel 's [ Master ? slave dialectic ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Master % E2 % 80 % 93slave_dialectic ) . It also has a lot to do with Oedipus complex , pseudo-sciences , and various mental health disorders and how they 're treated ( or not treated ) . The Master * is * similar to There Will Be Blood in some ways though . There is a focus on two characters who feed off each other , characters represent whole themes , there is an attempt to explore dysfunction , it 's ultimately very sad , it has amazingly real and powerful performances , the music is perfect and compliments the film in every way , the photography is beautiful and important to what 's going on , it has a certain strangeness to it , and it 's a very difficult film to really grasp on the first ... second ... or maybe even third or fourth viewing . I mean you could talk a lot about The Master simply regarding the mental health issue , and how it 's sometimes viewed , or how it 's sometimes possible for somebody to never receive the help they need . A big part of cults , and even some religions ( not an attack , it 's just the harsh truth ) , is that people often reject popular ideologies and seek out new ones . They go looking for meaning in their life when nothing else works , and sometimes if you have a certain weakness , even when you 're an educated person , you can fall victim to the types of scams that Dodd is running . Does he really believe his bullshit ? Maybe , maybe not . In the scene when he freaks out and yells at that girl from Jurassic Park because he changed part of the book he becomes exposed a little . He does n't have a defense and he ca n't explain what he 's doing so he simply does n't . But the simple fact is the change he made sounds better , appeals to a wider audience , and will ultimately work to his personal advantage when trying to achieve his goals : wealth , power , respect , greatness ... all these things that we can relate to . But when his efforts to help people , and mend their wounds , are applied to somebody who * legitimately needs help * , it 's not surprising to see that it fails . Dadd ca n't help Feddie because Dodd only helps people that * allow * themselves to be helped . They want to believe his nonsense because it 's comforting and gives meaning to their lives ( get it ? ) , but Freddie is n't like them . He 's uneducated , he 's been to war , he 's in love with a girl he ca n't have , he does n't understand people that well and he does n't particularly care . But he does give Dodd the chance to help and all the while is used like a puppet . Eventually , even somebody like Freddie is able to see how ridiculous it all is and accepts it for what it is : a controlling device . I think it helps to understand what exactly is going on with Freddie . Why does he succumb to all of Dodd 's bullshit , just to eventually break free and leave ? Then , at the end , he almost looks down on Dodd . Lancaster recognizes that Freddie has surpassed him , and is no longer in a position to be a slave for Dodd . Dodd says if they meet in the next life they will be mortal enemies , and he will fight him , and I think that might be the most depressing part of the film . This attempt to scare Freddie , or hurt him , fails because Freddie sees Dodd for what he is . He 's a phony , and Freddie can not learn anything more from him . He realizes now that he does n't need a master , he can be free in a way that even someone like Dodd ca n't . But Dodd is now in a position of * needing * Freddie . Freddie is going to leave , and Dodd desperately sings a song . The song makes more sense when you view the final extended trailer which shows a clip of Freddie writing on a sheet of paper clipped to a bulletin board . On it he writes `` gone to China '' after accepting a job that will take him to Shanghai . Dodd 's attempt to appeal to Freddie 's sense of exploration and self-discovery fails , and Freddie leaves with the upper hand . Now the master , no longer the slave . Of course , it 's implied that Peggy is really in charge , showing us that Dodd is a slave to her . Now , the film has * even more * going on in terms of names and their meanings , uses of color ( reds and blues , common for PTA ) , themes of escapism ( Freddie is always running away ) , and a pretty deliberate attempt to constantly mention or make references to boats , water , and the ocean ( the boat at the beginning , the boat that takes him away from Doris , the NAME Doris , the song at the end ) . How those all tie together is yet to be totally known , but it 's all certainly there for * some * reason . The Master is a terribly complicated and layered movie . It has so much going on , and so many themes and concepts being explored , that it 's truly daunting to attempt to gather everything up . Every scene , every action , every line , every moment ... it all means something . It 's all there to serve the story , but it always has so much more to say . I highly encourage multiple viewings . The last time I watched it , I took notes , and I 'll probably continue to do that until I sufficiently explore the whole thing . Hope this was helpful to you .

1 Oh for fuck 's sake . You 'd think that after the debacle where Sony paid people to tag buildings with PSP ads these folks would learn their lesson .

1 Yes , `` acting . ''

1 That 's an awesome observation

1 In all seriousness though District 9 showed that you can have story about non human / humanoid characters and still have them be likable and engaging . If you 're going to make a movie about a strange alien planet where all the life forms are beautiful , bizzare and alien can you not give the main aliens another set of arms or centaur legs or horns or something ? The film does Cat eyes , fangs , blue skin and pointy ears * really well * but they 're still things we 've seen a hundered time before .

1 at first I absolutely hated that ending , but after watching that movie a million times I can not think of a better way for it to end

1 Not to mention the doubled price that you 're giving to the box office for 20 extra minutes of work they put into the film , that 's probably the biggest difference !

1 Yep , they 've already started shooting Daredevil

1 Artificial delays are the result of nobody in the broadcast arena being interested in disrupting the model they 've used for decades - aired , interrupting ads to pay for the shows based on Nielsen-established ratings numbers .

1 I agree 100 % . But I like this quote from the review on CNN : > This is a movie about stupidity and cruelty in which stupidity and cruelty permeate almost every scene . Bay does n't hold anything back -- everything is over-pitched and underlined in hot neon . I think that was a criticism , but it was what made the movie work for me . You laugh at the stupidity , and cringe at the cruelty , but all in all , it 's what movies should be : entertaining . From reading that review , it seems like the director went in there expecting Lincoln . It 's a movie about how poor Bodybuilders in Miami in the 90s somehow got the idea to kidnap a rich guy , torture him , and take all of his money . What was he really expecting ? Did he watch the trailer ? As a matter of fact , my only major criticism with the movie ( aside from the overuse of slow motion ) , was that the trailer was essentially the exact same . Even down to the music at times .

1 I really recommend it . Amazing story , as well as some pretty cool 1600 's London CGI shots .

1 I do n't think we should ban his movies , but it disgusts me that people still work with him and nobody is ever called out on it . I could never see myself agreeing to work with him .

1 Assuming you have 60 hours to devote to it , this is the most emotional piece of fiction I 've ever experienced .

1 No , it 's called [ Capgras syndrome ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Capgras_delusion ) , it 's something that has been happening to humans long before tv / movies / books / etc were invented , it 's a disorder of the brain . So you have things the wrong way round , it 's likely Invasion of the Body Snatchers was made because of people experiencing this delusion .

1 While it may descend into `` I 've watched a more obscure film that you '' every once in a while , the amount of discussion and quality of those discussions are worlds higher than anything that can be found on /r/movies . /r/movies is for marketing . /r/truefilm is for discussion .

1 Yes . But based on the fact she just killed like 5 dudes with one shot to the heart each , I think she had pretty good aim at that point . Also , they were in the middle of Taipei . I think he would find someone to help pretty fast .

1 You say that as if gory-as-hell is a bad thing !

1 Ultron makes Vision in the comics , so it 's probably Ultron who converts JARVIS into Vision .

1 MoS is n't a bad movie IMO . Not great but a solid good movie .

1 Marvel has an ultimate plan . They have a general idea of what they want to do and where they want to take things . Ant-man ca n't be a standalone film in it 's own little universe . I 'm sure Wright had a bunch of great ideas which ultimately were shot down because they contradicted other plans or would n't make sense . He also has to use the already established lore which does take a bit of creative freedom away . I do n't think the issue here was that Marvel got in his way so much as he was n't ready to join the team . He wanted to do Ant-man but was n't so concerned with the big picture or had a different idea of what it should look like . I wish he had stuck it out . If the first one does well then they definitely would have given him a lot more freedom with the second film . Taking a character like Ant-man and throwing him on to the stage with all these big names about half-way through a play is not an easy thing to pull off . You 're going to have to be careful and cautious about how you do it , but once he 's established it all becomes a lot easier .

1 A wise actor playing an actor playing an actor in a movie explained very simply why Leo did n't win for Gilbert Grape : `` You never go full retard . ''

1 Of all the ridiculous and shitty things in that movie , what somehow pissed me off the most was , any time he was getting shot at , his constant yelling of > I 'M ON VACATION ... NO YOU FUCKING ARE N'T ! ! ! You came to Russia specifically to find your degenerate arsehole of a son and rescue the dickhead from the mob or whatever . But he kept screaming that line out like a ) it made any difference to the situation , or b ) as though it were true and he was thus pissed off at the situation he had accidentally , and not deliberately , gotten himself in to .

1 `` The good news is your dates are here . The bad news is ... they 're dead . '' Classic cult 80 's movie . Was n't available on DVD for the longest time , if I remember correctly .

1 The writers / directors of the movie were born and raised in Chicago , AKA America

1 That was crushing when I first watched it . Way to take one of the best literary works with such deep and complex concepts and motifs and turn into a second rate kids movie . I 'm hopeful that there will be a reboot to the series that does it justice

1 everyone in that movie was fueled on something . I mean the movie itself was fuel . I left the theater feeling so overstimulated , with such a head rush , it was like being on something way stronger than caffeine . The real world felt like it was going in slow motion .

1 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

1 Knowing that a movie is done at least partially with practical effects give it a sense of mystery . When I watch a movie with a lot of big action or cool effects , I like to figure out how those scenes were made . When its obviously CGI , people usually just write it off as `` computers '' and do n't give it a second thought .

1 I agree , I think it also depends on the reception of the viewer

1 Blade seems kinda like he -should- live in his own little universe away from all the other heroes , though that 's how i feel about Batman in DC . I do n't know much about Luke Cage but he seems pretty cool .

1 When Deadpool was introduced in the 90 's he was played straight . For the first few years he was most definitely a rip-off and the name could be an homage at best . He only became recognised as a comedy character with a personality of his own when Joe Kelly had his run on the title which was 6 years later .

1 Actually , I think his performance in * The Rundown * is pretty damn good , and that 's an action-comedy .

1 Not to mention how awesome of a film it is

1 The Departed vs . Infernal Affairs is what I point to when I want to try to explain to people that it 's not the concept that makes a great film ( or any work of art for that matter ) , but the execution . It 's why I do n't pay much attention when people make big deal about one film 'ripping off ' another ; whichever one does it best is the one that is worth watching -not simply the one that did it first .

1 I am having a conversation and here is another rebuttal . You ca n't both be a consumer and a producer on the same product . So you want a multi-million dollar feature film AND you want a piece of the profits ? Then become a producer . Putting money into a crowd funded project is n't about making money from a consumer stand point , it 's about having even a sliver of creative control in the content you want to see , and it 's about building a symbiotic artistic community between Artist and Audience . I 'm really confused why you bring ethics into this ? My train of logic is this : the audience wants something that they can not create themselves , so it is up to the artist to create it for them . In the world we live in with all of its economic and social boundaries it is not realistically viable for the artist to give to the audience what they want . The higher up the artist is on the social / economic / business tier , the easier it is to get the art produced , but they still are artistically curbed by the boundaries put in place by the distributor / producer who are putting up the chunk of change for non-art related logistics of producing a piece . This means marketing and distribution . This also means now the distributor / producer has a say in what this piece of art looks like . Now who of the two has a better idea of what YOU want as an audience member ? It 's the artist . Historically speaking studio meddling in films has been negative . Crowd funding puts that control back into the hands of the audience . We fund the distribution / producing aspects of the work , the artist handles the rest , and we are given a piece of art that comes straight from a collaboration between us and the artist . There 's no need for a return in the profits as an audience member . If you want a return , become a movie producer .

1 Fox movie is n't it ?

1 Really enjoyed this movie . Bonus points for Monica Belluci , as well .

1 Not always . Some people do opt for lesser known actors for roles , to keep the * `` oh , it 's just ____ playing himself again '' * from happening . Off the top of my head , though , all I can think of is Cavill in Man of Steel , and Renner in the Hurt Locker cast for this reason .

1 You liked the sequel ? Dumb and Dumber is my favorite comedy of all time and I really did n't like the sequel at all . It was really bad gross-out humor which had been done before and better in other movies , and largely the previous film .

1 After I saw the first preview with Lana singing , I had Once Upon a Dream on repeat for a few days . Absolute perfection how she transformed it .

1 You saw quantum of solace ... right ?

1 I see your point . I think it 's interesting to think about the fact that US did a very similar thing to end WW2 . They detonated two atomic bombs , supposedly to scare the Japanese into surrendering , thereby shortening the war and saving hundred thousands of human lives that would have been lost if US had been forced to win the war by `` ordinary warfare '' . The threat of nuclear war was also what kept the Cold war relatively cold . So both * actual * mass-killings and * threat of * mass-killings have been used before , and it 's often argued that this did indeed save many many lives . But there are of course people who say WW2 would have ended soon anyway , that the US only detonated the bombs to scare Soviet Russia , and so on . We will never * know * who was right . ( But all scenarios are n't equally likely . Facing uncertainty we * must * take chances sometimes . In those cases , I think , the utilitarian calculus is still the best thing we got . )

1 Yeah to make his roar they used sounds from a train engine . Fucking amazing .

1 > Can not believe such a shitty animated movie is so popular Maybe it 's because you 're in the minority and that most people that watched it actually liked it .

1 I thought it was pretty straightforward and well explained .

1 See ... I do n't see Noah or Exodus in the same category . They are rooted in biblical stories , sure , but that is as much an ethnography / mythology of a people - and the foundation of several world faiths - as anything . Left Behind , on the other hand ? I am very , very sceptical about that , because it is not so much an historical tale as a series of stories created to push Evangelical Christianity ( no offense , Evangelicals .. but it is rubbish. )

1 Aw . Fine ...

1 Eh , people are different ... I could definitely see how a lot of people just would n't enjoy / 'get ' Garden State . And I really did n't get the impression that Garden State was trying too hard ... It simply is what it is and you can interpret that however you wish , which is why I think a lot of people enjoy the movie because there is n't really one particular way to interpret it ; it 's just full of odd characters living their lives . If you want a strong linear storyline with a particular message and meaning ... Garden State is n't it .

1 this was funny ... i 'd rather see this movie

1 I have tried decoding everything I could with that movie , but that line will forever elude me .

1 X-men villain , but yes .

1 I like writing apocalyptic horror stories .

1 So ? The Wiz is a great movie !

1 Kind of impossible to resist arrest while being choked to death and dogpiled . And even if he was , why does that warrant a summary execution ?

1 Most comedies are shot this way . They 'll do some takes exactly as it says on the script , and then let the actors go wild improvising during further takes .

1 So are we entering a decline in the fluctuating quality of superhero movies throughout the years ?

1 There 's only two reviews on IMDB , a 7 and a 1 . The person who gave it a 1 did n't even actually judge the movie and just went on an incoherent racial tangent , so I 'd trust RT on this one .

1 The effects were great ... so great , I ended up feeling motion sick ! I think I was most impressed with the floating island . Edit : added island comment

1 Completely agreed . Was n't really scared by it , but damn , I was completely engrossed . It was * so much fun * watching all the tropes get referenced then slaughtered , with the awesome addition of Lovecraftian horror tossed it . Great movie .

1 Almost all good shows float back and forth between MotW episodes and Myth-arc episodes . It 's been a successful format since The X-Files . It makes it easier for new people to get into a show , easier for the writers , and its better for syndication .

1 `` Have I been living under a rock ? '' Or something along those lines .

1 The Shining was my first ever introduction to the 'psychological horror ' . Great movie .

1 That was beautifully done .

1 That 's true , but it does n't mean it ca n't be recognised as a sad state of affairs . It 's a movie about celebrating gay pride set thirty years ago , and yet now , in 2015 , the homosexual aspect is being hidden because it 'll make it more appealing to people . Sure it 's not a vindictive or hateful decision , it 's a marketing one , but it is still dispiriting and noteworthy that the two circles can mix like that .

1 Shit , you 're right . It was Belfast .

1 Both of those actors , in those roles , have provided some of my favorite film performances . Especially Ian McKellen .

1 I was annoyed when they first announced it . My first thought was that half the book was them setting up camp in a forest , staying for a bit , packing up and moving to a new forest . Rinse , repeat for like 400 pages . Cut it down to one scene and you really do n't lose much . Basically , yes , I agree : )

1 WTF does that mean ?

1 Other way around , Grant Morrison liked the song .

1 I remember at the time going , * fuck yeah Ang Lee , how can this go wrong ? * But left the film feeling very meh . I honestly think everyone on that production had the best interests of the film at heart . It just did n't make for great cinema , as a comic book film or as something else .

1 The old Joe that came back with a bag on his head was the the young Joe who had seen what he thought was his older self kill a woman who was trying to protect her son . It 's possible that he believed that if he came back and was willingly killed , that her life would be saved . He did n't realize the nature of the double loop that he was part of .

1 Shitpost is shit .

1 I want to be the person whose job it is to find these places ...

1 Man do I love that movie . Blows the original out of the water .

1 You killed it mate .

1 Agreed . Megan Fox is n't a good actress , but she is n't bad enough to make me avoid a movie . However , shit writing and cliched motivations WILL make me avoid a movie . Unfortunately , Megan Fox and shitty writing pretty much go hand in hand ...

1 Nobody thought that was a good line . Except for you , I guess . And presumably Richard Kelly .

1 No . With this , you will always recieve holy perfection . He truly is a benevolent Lord to bestow this gift upon us !

1 This was my thought as well . All ( or most ) of the dwarves played by older actors seem to have pretty elaborate beards .

1 Excellent choice . [ Here 's the opening in case anybody wanted to watch it . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Yg8MqjoFvy4 )

1 Memento is exceedingly clever in the way it uses its structure to both explain how an earlier ( but chronologically later ) scene happened , as well as why , but also still manages to throw in big twists too . It would n't have worked anywhere near as well in a purely linear format , and there 's a lot to be said for how the writer was able to hold it all together .

That 's a fair point , and admittedly something I did n't think of , but as far as I know , this stuff is the job of the agent rather than the actor / actress themselves , so you 'd think their agents would be willing to negotiate aggressively .

1 I just want to point out that two accepted anti-heroes Deadpool and the Punisher happen to commit murder , and I believe in one case Deadpool pretty much killed every character in the comic book universe thus committing genocide . Deadpool is arguably really , really bad , and he started out as a bad guy but somehow he became one of the good guys . Same deal for the Punisher . Punisher is one of the good guys , but he 's committed crimes that are just as foul as Loki 's . So , what 's the difference ? It all comes down to motive . While Loki might occasionally do good things , he does n't do it to clean the streets of evil like the Punisher or to impress hot babes like Deadpool . Instead Loki 's actions all revolve back to his own self-serving principles . TL ; DR Loki 's actions are not what make him villainous it 's his motive .

1 I 'm more than happy to be proven wrong , but based on the strength of what I 've seen so far , I 'm not confident . Hollywood has murdered so many franchises that I 'm tired of picking through the bones .

1 I had the exact sentiments when I watched it . Do n't get me wrong - it was entertaining . I just thought the first one was a little better .

1 The concept sounds goofy but thats what I love about the first film , despite that , it manages to show how * terrifying * that scenario would be in real life .

1 I bet we can find a similar article written five years ago and five before that and five before that ad infinitum .

1 nope.avi

1 It 's not an enjoyable film , so I can see why some do n't respond to it , but as far as craftsmanship , it is exquisite . The direction is amazingly refined and the acting perfect . I understand why it 's getting attention .

1 Get off my plane .

1 If need be .

1 Thanks ! For this I used Photoshop , After Effects , and edited with Sony Vegas . I usually use Avid , but I did n't have it on my computer at the time .

1 It 's my favorite movie so I would recommend it

1 The cadence of the dialog exchange .

1 I loved the ending . It was sad , but we got closure on everything and saw how the world would still go on without the main cast . And the [ Y the Last Man ] ( # s `` straight jacket '' ) was such a perfect callback to the first issue .

1 I would doubt it , the first movie does n't really do much of the book , the battle is really long as is the lead up to it , so unless the stiff that then the third will be the battle

1 Those are some solid pens , erm , I mean puns .

1 It 's that `` fun '' . I would n't call it a masterpiece . But , I too watch it every October

1 Maybe this is the one where he makes it through the whole movie . But probably 1 / 2 through is my guess .

1 ? * CRUMB BOWL * ?

1 Because Elias Koteas could still kick his ass .

1 Haha yeah the opening song I 'm Not in Love by 10cc is a personal favorite of both of them .

1 So you 're furious because a reporter botched an interview ? The only explanation I can think of as to why you 're so angry is that he took your seat at the interview .

1 I believe there is a director 's cut that is much , much better .

1 IMDB said : > The film tells a story of John Oldman , a man claiming to be a Cro-Magnon , i.e. , Magdalenian caveman , who still survives after 14,000 years . The entire film is shot in a small house and its porch , relying solely on the conversation of the characters to keep the plot moving : the film is an intellectual discourse between the alleged 14,000-year-old Cro-Magnon and his professor and teacher friends at his farewell party . btw , saw the film a month ago . Enjoyed it immensely .

I think Star Wars nerds would argue that one of the huge philosophical differences between the Jedi and the Sith involves the relationship of the Force and `` control . '' The Sith seek to control the Force individually , which manifests all kinds of `` evil '' behaviors , while the Jedi submit to it and allow it to control them and their bodies . I actually think the lightsaber fight choreography in the prequels is incredibly subtle and well done , and supports the thematic Jedi / Sith contrast .

1 I may be thinking of Jack the Giant Slayer . I apologise

1 Pre-Marvel Madness , that 's what comic book movies DID ! Not to defend the quality , just giving a little insight .

1 You can see on the side `` SNTL2 '' which I 'd wager means it 's a Mark 2 version Sentinel . On the Trask Industries website there 's a timeline that shows that in 2020 the `` Mark X '' is released . My hope is that that 's the huge version we know and love from the comics / cartoons .

1 > It did n't `` transcend '' its target audience because men and boys ca n't , and do n't try to , relate to women and girls . Well , I 'm a guy , and I have no problem relating to stories about women or girl problems or relationships or whatever , so there 's at least one outlier tossing a wrench in your theory . See , to me good art goes beyond empathy and evokes sympathy . Let me put it like this : If you have lost a loved one in a car accident , then you will probably be deeply moved by any film in which a secondary character dies in a car accident . However , this has little to do with the film 's portrayal and almost everything to do with your own emotions and experience . You 've been there , so you can empathize with the characters . The challenge , and the beauty of film when it 's well done , is being able to take someone who 's never been through that experience and involve them in it , allowing them to share in the character 's emotions even though they have no frame of reference for it in their own lives . In other words , evoke sympathy in the audience . Empathy is easy because all it takes is a trigger . But evoking sympathy ? That 's an art . EDITED TO SAY : In the context of Brave , the mother-daughter issues will likely evoke empathy in any woman who 's had a lot of conflict with either her daughter or her mother - which is to say , almost all of them . The question is , does the conflict have real meat to it ? Or is its appeal mainly just women being able to say `` I know that feel '' ? The answer is up to the filmmakers . Pixar has shown in the past that they can get us emotionally involved in just about * anything . * I do n't think the whole `` they 're women '' thing really has any clout here because we 're talking about the studio that made us fall in love with a ( mostly ) mute , androgynous robot . Again , these questions are not rhetorical devices but actual questions because I have not seen the film myself .

1 No , he 's trying to get you to go and see Sin City 2 .

1 Exactly . Step out of your comfort zone and be pleasantly surprised . Netflix 's greatest asset is that it 's easy to take risks and chances with unknown content .

1 they should ! If I 'm paying 8 dollars a month !

1 Agreed . It 'd be a disaster . That being said , I would n't be against seeing Daniel Craig in a Steve McQueen biopic that includes shooting a scene from Bullitt , or something .

1 No.. Personally as an atheist I ca n't speak for everyone but no I do n't reject the bible but I take it for what it is , written mostly by men hundreds of years after the life of Jesus who more then likely is a personification of many other stories of quite possibly real people . Most of the good messages in the bible are repeated through out history , the golden rule for example Matthew 7:12 , Luke 10:25-28 well this message or idea predates Jesus time by a few hundred years and is repeated in many other religions .

1 * Blu-Ray quality video

1 There 's something of a curse , but there are about as many actresses who went on to have successful careers after Bond as had their careers suffer . Teri Hatcher went on to do Desperate Housewives , Jane Seymour was in Dr. Quinn , Kim Basinger won an Oscar after being a `` Bond '' girl ( Admittedly she was n't in a proper Eon Bond film ) , Famke Janssen went on to do the X-Men movies , etc .

1 Awesome ! So happy for him , he 's a great dude .

1 It is actually quite difficult to determine the best film of the 70 's . So many amazing films were made during the time . You could also add in Rocky , Network , Godfather II etc .

1 * Worst death eveeeeerrrrr *

1 [ Michael Caine on American accents ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=kXJ-oAq2XZg ) .

1 They have zero interest in shutting it down . Shutting it down is just their threat so they can get a nice chunk of the profits , which would then be free money for finding a piece of paper holding minor rights that they sat on for almost twenty years .

1 Agree on all accounts ! Loved it .

1 John Marston should be played by Brad Pitt . He can certainly do the role , see Assassination of Jesse James .

1 Exactly . No Bruce , no dice .

1 That was a masterpiece , and should recieve a full HD rerelease .

1 This . I also found plot holes distracting and the two main characters were acting independently from eachother most of the time so it felt very disjointed . The best part of the movie was Jeff Daniels . I was like `` oh so that 's what real acting looks like . '' First half had some goodies as well .

1 Clerks was made for $ 27,000 and grossed around $ 3 million . Mallrats was made for more ( Box office mojo does n't know how much ) and grossed $ 2 million . The first movie was made over many years ( idea , writing , refining , etc ) . The second movie was made in a much shorter time span . They assumed Kevin was the new hot director and rushed a product to market that did n't have a chance . It is n't a bad movie but it does n't feel like the rest of the viewaskewaverse . The love for his movies comes from the fact that he can easily articulate the life of those who grew up in the 90s . He is n't a master of his craft like some other directors but what he does do , he does well . He is funny , eloquent ( though sometimes makes his characters say things they would n't ) and thoughtful . Edit : said articulate too many times

1 Unrealized masterpiece .

1 Yup . It 's obvious that a ) a lot of people die on the ground , b ) some more people die in space ( airlock blowout ) , and c ) probably everyone dies ( `` Ca n't let this get back to earth '' ) .

1 I wan na see Motor III , but I have n't seen the first two yet . * sigh * - I 'll never find out what 's up with those motorbikes .

1 Oh please no . The first was a terrible film . DBZ is ripe for being a film series but you could n't have fucked up the first film more than they did .

1 Watched it again not long ago , full body goosebumps at the song climax , amazing .

1 That 's a good question ! It 's interesting you almost never see that . My only guess would be because Jack Ryan is an ongoing character that has been portrayed in five films by four ( very famous ) actors so they could have decided it 's less about the actor in the role and more about the story he 's helping portray . Still though , with a track record like Alec Baldwin , Harrison Ford , and Ben Affleck if I were Chris Pine I 'd try and get my name up there but maybe the studio decided that the name Jack Ryan is advertisement enough . Bottom line is that I have no idea , though . I 'm more of a visual aide than anything else .

1 I think they knew they had a winner , there

1 I was n't too big a fan of the plot , but I will say the soundtrack is unlike any other soundtrack . I 'm an Angels & Airwaves fan . Thus , I listened to their album 'Love ' many times before having seen this . When the remixed versions of these songs came through in the film , I understood the emotion of the film that much more because I knew the emotion of the song from beforehand . The music gives a whole new life to this film and it 's an awe-inspiring experience ( if you 've heard the album )

1 It 's pretty bad , I remember enjoying it as a kid , watched it again recently ... big mistake .

1 You 're just trying to find something to be offended about .

1 EVERY paragraph ? ? Whoa , thanks !

1 Spot on , dude . The thing that makes me want to forgive all this stuff and enjoy the movie is the visual design , inspired by Syd Mead which looked both futuristic and plausible . There were a lot of little concepts I enjoyed , but I could n't shake the annoyance that they were at the service of such weak , pandering storytelling .

1 Haha , completely forgot about first scene where Dynamite 's undercover brother is amazingly well-spoken . Going to have to watch this film again now ...

1 It does n't go well in the series , either . I 'm just glad that they ca n't have people 's eyes shiver all the time in the movie when they stare at things for 3 hours . Unfortunately , they apparently can keep the screaming .

1 /r/ContagiousLaughter

1 I 'm so happy you brought this into my life .

1 Maybe , but I think it 's more pointing out that not only is this thing going to kill political opponents but even non-government innocents who 's background means they have a predisposition to fighting authority .

1 Home Alone 2 : The Hangover part II .

1 Good point . There is an active debate about this topic , as referenced here : http : / www.visual-memory.co.uk / faq / I should probably mention that I love The Shining . It has , at times , been my favorite movie . I was just shouting out a well-known bit of Kubrick lore to make Kubrick-lovers tingle .

1 You know what they say , everybody is a critic . The majority of people when they love a film they will try to defend it and look outside the box to find excuses that fit their narrative . People also do the same for critically popular movies and shows , it does n't matter . I have a buddy who refuses to watch Breaking Bad because he thinks it 's over hyped but has yet to see a single episode . Certain genres help fuel that thinking and the comic book movie genre is the worst . Being a comic book movie people seem to think it 's gets an automatic pass for silliness and incoherence or overall bad writing and character development . People still defend the new Hobbit movies because `` It 's supposed to be a fairy tale from Bilbo 's perspective , it 's supposed to be exaggerated ! '' . Everyone has a right to enjoy whatever movie they like , but it still does not make it a good movie at a fundamental level simply because you want it to be .

1 Yes .

1 It 's important to note , it was just 3 years ago where both David Goyer and Zack Snyder had zero interest in a Superman film , largely because they did n't see how it would work in a modern context . Now they 're the two biggest contributors to his comeback film . Just a food for thought . All someone really needs is a hook to the lore .

1 In the original trilogy he was a very minor side character with one important job : He was the only bounty hunter that managed to find Han Solo and his crew .

1 > Is this article trying to say `` Interstellar is too clever for the people '' ? I do n't think it 's saying that at all . Quite the opposite actually .

1 Not purchasing something based on what a * movie * stands for is exactly the type of highminded bullshit the movie was making fun of .

1 The film was also rated R , there is a lot of swearing , whole ton of F-bombs . The Weinsteins decided to edit it with far less swearing so they could get a PG-13 rating and re-release it to try and make more money .

It 's definitely open to interpretation .

1 I liked the score . Lots of Tchaikovsky bits , as you might imagine .

1 Maybe people thought you were being dismissive , but I think you have a point . The movie was visually and aurally appealing , and the story was obviously nonlinear . You can spend ( and waste , imho ) a lot of time and energy trying to figure out the one right interpretation , or you can accept it as a gorgeous semi-coherent dream-like movie that is what you make it .

1 I live in Atlanta where its being shot . Definitely in the works .

1 Yes

1 Baxter saved them from the brown bears at the end of the 1st one . He told the bears a story of his travels after he got booted off the bridge and the bears got friendly with Brick .

1 You 're probably right , actually . I keep forgetting about Jessie Eisenberg and Gal Gadot in Superman / Batman , and I am not excited about those castings . On the other hand , Marvel keeps knocking it out of the park with casting , and each movie now seems to have a surprisingly big name actor come in for a one time role . Winter Soldier had Robert Redford , Guardians of the Galaxy has Glen Close , Avengers 2 has James Spader , and Ant Man will have Michael Douglas . If they keep up the trend , then there will likely be another interesting actor cast in Cap 3 , and that will probably draw me in more . I know my interest in seeing Redford in Winter Soldier was one of the reasons I went to see it opening weekend .

1 Pacific Rim is fairly impressive , with some enormous-scale scenery and big stompy robots . Non-stop 3D rain ! Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was good too , with very polished 3D - very smooth , if that 's actually a thing that can be measured . Dredd 3D is pretty cheap to pick up these days , and pretty good with the 3D theatrics . The slow-mo falling scenes are really impressive . Also a dumb-fun movie .

1 Blackfish made me cancel the plans I had for visiting Seaworld last year .

1 My wife works with animals in a research lab , and constantly gets shit from PETA and other groups , even though they are treated very well , and not for the things PETA usually has problems with ( it 's a surgical research lab , mostly for cancer and childhood head trauma ) . Anyway , from their perspective , everything they do for their day-to-day job is to care for the animals and make sure they are comfortable and healthy and happy , and when they 're verbally attacked by such a group , they get defensive . I can imagine that they would see such a poll and go vote in their University 's favor of their own free will because they want to feel vindicated . And that is what I believe happened in this Sea World poll as well . It 's only 177 out of thousands of employees , but people assume it 's malice since Sea World took out those full-page PR ads .

1 His secret identity is actually Lois Lane , world class crossdresser and reporter .

1 Hmm I hate to admit it but it was in a time when McCaugnougy was n't such a bad actor and he had 2 good movies back then . And Jodie Foster was just as perfect in this role as in every other role she had . And you ca n't take the hottest actress for a scientist role . Not that Jodie Foster is n't attractive , but she is more like a female Tom Hanks , a normal person .

1 So 1 pixel is 10 meters ( 1000cm ) , a banana is about 20cm long . 1000 divided by 20= 50 . I 'm no science man , but from my lack of math skills , I believe that a banana would be 1 50th of a pixel in comparison . Fuck knows if I 'm right , I do n't know math .

1 How the fuck would you need to `` completely rewrite '' this character to allow a black man to play him ? Bond 's ethnicity is totally irrelevant in most of his movies , and you could remake them with a black actor without changing the script at all . Maybe the ones set in the cold war require a white guy , but how would Casino Royale be different if Bond was black ? It would n't .

1 came here to post this . immediately forced my friends to watch this the day after I saw it . a sick and charming movie .

1 The jokers ' were 19 years apart

1 I think pretty much everyone gets overshadowed by John Noble . He was * too * good .

1 it 's chilling how well it 's executed

1 TMNT !

1 Okay , so : no pitchforks , only torches then ?

1 I completely disagree with your opinion about Django . Funny People went on for way too long ...

1 I thought they handled the Anikan plotline quite well in that , but the Grievous one horrendously . Grievous came out more comical than scary . He was pretty fucking awesome and scary in the Clone Wars 2D animated cartoon . The entire movie after he is named Vader is kick-ass .

1 I disagree , killing killers is not evil , someone who would spread destruction and murder innocents is evil , someone ending the murders and destruction by ending the life of the bastard responsible is a good thing .

1 `` It was n't Cabo , Ari..It was a Red Roof Inn at Rosarita '' `` It sure felt like Cabo to me . ''

1 For me , Fran ? ois ? Frenchy ? Fran ? ais really got me taking my wallet out .

1 You 're describing [ Equilibrium ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0238380 / ? ref_=sr_1 ) with Christian Bale and Sean Bean .

1 Captain Phillips

1 I was hoping for something more along the lines of `` Mondo just pawn in game of life '' . http : / i.imgur.com / JzLeC4O.jpg

1 Oh good , I can listen to Antichrist while at work !

1 `` As a loyal viewer , I feel they owe me . ''

1 That 's when i found it

1 I would like to see a re-cast Lord of the Rings Trilogy with Eddie Murphy in every role .

1 Just go for Iron Man 3 , it has kick arse fight scenes , childish humour and an unexpected in at the end which stops your heart ! Of course , you could just spend a day of it an watch Iron Man , Iron Man 2 , Thor , Captain America , The Avengers , then Iron Man 3 just so you 're all up to date on the universe : P

1 and jamaca in Dr . No I think

1 I 'm one of those who usually watches it all at once . Unfortunately , when I watch with my dad , he pauses it constantly , so I get pretty frustrated .

1 > While I still think this was a marketing choice and not some kind of shady racist move ( again , it 's a movie about a SLAVE , how fucking stupid do you have to be to think the protagonist is a white guy ? ) You 're giving them and the general public far too much credit . If people do n't know anything about the movie and are just basing it off of the poster , they could assume it has an entirely different setting outside of America and / or outside of that time period and easily assume Pitt was the protagonist . White people were slaves are various points in history too and the word slave has different meanings beyond African slaves in America . It was n't the only point in history where slavery occurred by a long stretch . > I feel to remind some of you that racism in Italy does n't work the same way as racism in the US Thats a pretty loaded comment , to be honest . Racism is racism , just marking it off as working differently is turning a blind eye to real issues . Italy does in fact have serious issues with race , as does America . Are they different forms of race issues ? Sure , but they ultimately do n't `` work differently '' . Its racism . Regardless of the fact that some groups of people might react to something differently that others . Sometimes it just means they are more attuned to racial biases and subtle , sometimes unintentional , racism . Also while I do n't think they were trying to be racist , their retraction and reaction by putting out the `` definitive poster '' is just damage control . Thats basically the American market poster with Italian instead of English . They went out of their way to not only create but print the posters OP posted . And while it may have been of a marketing choice , it absolutely was diminishing the role of Ejiofor . He is the star . He is the main focus of the film , Pitt was a bit character . That IS diminishing a role in favor of a much more marketable actor despite him playing a significant lesser role . I 'm not saying it does n't happen too often , it does , but lets not pretend it does n't diminish the role of the lead actor .

1 Thanks for ruining my day ( productivity ) .

1 Unless you could John Hurt , that is .

1 Point Break will be out around the same time , but we know that wo n't be a problem .

1 These people are attempting to murder him for simply existing . He 's like a cornered animal that is just fighting to survive . When he realizes there is no way to survive he settles with teaching Deckard a lesson .

1 The box office , unfortunately .

1 Poppycock . If my findings are correct there 's enough iron to allow one to squeeze a tin can with enough force to eject it 's contents right into ones own mouth or pipe .

1 Nah its important that we see him work by himself without Schultz at the end , to show his development form nervous timid slave to independent confident suave bounty hunter

1 1 : That 's not a big deal 2 : Actually yes , we have the authority and power so you * have * to respect us . It takes little effort for us to call the cops and escort you out too . 3 . Then come to the movie 15 minutes late . Do n't whine about advertisements . You have a TV , you sit through commercials do n't you ? Amusement parks have tons of adds everywhere too , you just do n't notice them as well . It 's subliminal marketing .

1 No help when it 's macular . It 's not acuity , she has a big splodge in her central vision blocking it .

1 What good will that accomplish ? Sure , congress can be pissed , but what bearing does that have regarding Sony ?

1 Maximum Overdrive

1 Little bit like that one James Bond movie almost

1 I think both of those were cheapos capitalizing on the bigger budgeted and longer production schedule of `` The Abyss '' .

1 The new Godzilla did have a whole , `` Natural balance '' thing going on , which is what Mothra is all about . I doubt they 'd include her fairies , though .

1 Sexual ways

1 I can see how you would n't like Drive , I did n't love it myself , but you got ta at least respect that they were trying to do * something * with it , ya know ? I see an `` average '' movie as being one that just does everything by the books and the end result is just a 2 hour pile of `` who gives a shit '' . Even if you do n't think It translated well through the screen , Drive still had a pulse . Hell , any movie that 's willing to sacrifice dialogue and try and express 90 % of itself through visuals alone does n't deserve to be called average

1 Good Will Hunting is a mind fuck ?

1 It actually started on an obscure * chan image board . Someone then posted a screenshot of a youtube comment to /r/funny .

1 I do n't want to be `` that guy '' on Reddit but it 's easy to give it to this film because of the pedigree and you have one of the top 5 or 6 best actors of all time in this role . Lewis is like the modern day Marlon Brando without the weight gain .

1 Goodness , the CGI looks amazing . Especially when the torch is held up to that chimp 's face .

1 Nope . Has n't been a new song , band or singer in the last eight years . Piracy and online distribution completely obliterated the market .

1 `` For relaxing times , make it Suntory time . '' - [ Lost in Translation ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0335266 / )

1 Exactly , he 's Stringer Bell in The Wire universe too , that does n't mean he never acts again .

1 They horribly misused the lead of Sherlock though . Pray it does not happen a second time .

1 My blood boils every time that fucking movie is mentioned .

1 Before IMDB ( and the interwebs ) , watching the credits was pretty much the only way to find out who played what , what band played which songs , what were the shooting locations , which FX shop did the special effects , et al .

1 I loved it because it 's a testament that a proper World War Z movie CAN be made .

1 I did n't think the disconnect was that large . They seemed to be suggesting that the animals were highly intelligent and emotional and thus , were reacting accordingly to their situation . The same way a human might change mentally or react violently to inhumane captivity .

1 [ More often than never ] ( http : / www.change.org / victories ) . It 's pretty neat . Disclosure : I am an engineer at Change.org .

1 What ? That movie was postmodern art , man .

1 i still mock him all the time for that , but its spelled KOAARRRRRRRRRRRRLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL according to Rick .

1 Exactly . A horror movie can have strong science fiction elements , and vice-versa . * Event Horizon * is another good example .

1 I did n't hate the movie , but did find it to be pretty mediocre . Next to that beautifully cut trailer though , the movie looks like a hot pile of garbage .

1 There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman . Some kind of abstraction , but there is no real me . Only an entity . Something illusory . And though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feeling flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable . I simply am not there .

1 Love The Fountain . Glad to see it top someone else 's 2006 list .

1 Regardless he walked away with fifty million dollars .

1 It 's stupid to even have to defend that The Avengers was a dumb , really average action movie . There are a lot of twenty somethings on reddit that never grew up with anything better , so some of the worst material still seems original to them . Time to watch more movies .

1 I AM THE TABLE

1 Is it just slightly possible that he did n't enjoy the film , or are we just going to baselessly assume this user is resistant to new films ? I do love baseless assumptions . I feel smart with none of the associated work .

1 I am never bored in a Christopher Nolan film , even with his not so great ones .

1 * OHHH SHIT *

1 It 's Russell Crowes idiot brother . http : / i.imgur.com / 9io3NAi.png ? 1

1 Of course it 's not a new thing . It 's just good that there are some people trying to create dialogue about it . Nothing is going to change if nobody is discussing the problem .

1 They 're a mini version of a character you 've come to love . [ My mini Walter White ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / RKbODLY.jpg ) is very awesome .

1 Paul was n't apart of the Cornetto trilogy , because it was n't directed by Edgar Wright .

1 > an epic trench of pubescent emo wangst You , sir , have a way with words . I am now pursuing opportunities to make use of 'wangst ' .

1 Let 's just say I was once raped while watching the movie and watching the movie was , at the time , the more significant inconvenience .

1 Wow , way to bend his words internet website .

1 Oh wow , haha . I wish . Tillikum and the other Shamu whales would not fit in our facility , sadly . We house and rehabilitate small reptiles and amphibians .

1 Yeah exactly . We 'll see a trailer in about half a year with stuff from the actual movie .

1 You da real MVP .

1 I was thinking [ Black Sabbath . ] ( http : / webringjustice.files.wordpress.com / 2011 / 07 / sabbath78tour.jpg )

1 I had to look it up myself . `` a proton pump inhibitor '' Sounds like a star trek sex toy .

1 I think he means the extras that I linked to on their actual site . There are a ton more there .

1 There is a word problem in here somewhere . If batman is travailing at 180 mph ... .

1 While I 've spent my fair share of time nit-picking the things wrong with the new movie , the description does n't really do it justice . There are problems , yes , but it 's not as convoluted as they 've giving it credit for being .

1 Hi . You must be new here .

1 Most realistic fight ever .

1 Guys it 's sarcasm ...

1 Meh . It was not only a `` And they all lived happily ever after '' ending , but an explanation of just how happily they all lived . However , if she had n't stuck it in there would have been endless clammoring for more Harry Potter , so it 's probably for the best .

1 It was probably pre recorded and just showed it on a screen inside the theater .

1 Just do what 99 % of people who watch the movie do ... Pirate it .

1 `` Ugh it stings ! Why is it salty ? ''

1 It 's comedy by reversal . Hicks getting terrorized . Also gore . I liked it but not pants shittingly good .

1 Yes I get that , but why not just hire a New Zealander ? There are actors from New Zealand , lots of them .

1 Loved Before Midnight . It 's a shame how few people have heard of that trilogy .

1 Because of [ this guy ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=fkWD50Pz7sk ) !

1 ... there is no Y : The Last Man movie .

1 Apparently it 's complicated , and not entirely back with Marvel yet , here 's an article about it : http : / comicbook.com / 2014 / 11 / 18 / does-marvel-studios-have-the-rights-back-to-namor- /

1 Fellowship particularly . Especially after the spectacle of the Helms Deep and Minas Tirith fights wear off .

1 that 's because a lot of tisch kids come in focused on writing or directing , and aspire to shoot straight to the top echelon without working their way up . very few students ( kids ) know they want to be gaffers or grips , and therefore are less likely to put work into actually handling equipment , and more likely to have loft ideas about screenwriting . I 'm not saying thats right , im saying thats accurate . most likely you 're working with these students and not the ones that would actually enjoy being stunt cam ops

1 Counts

1 Blue Steel ! What , no Ferrari or Le Tigra ?

1 I think Zimmer pretty much phoned it in for the Batman trilogy . He had the chance to at least attempt to write a memorable score for that but did n't . It may have been technically sound and it suited the movie , but it was ultimately forgettable .

1 That 's what I was implying .

1 Definitely Magnolia . I really cared about and was interested in all the characters in the movie , and I loved all the storylines . P.T . Anderson has really good storytelling capabilities , and it 's shown by how quickly that movie goes by .

1 On the off chance you 're actually not making a joke , that 's Jeremy Lin .

1 Damn , I 'd forgotten about that Eastern Promises scene . Good call .

1 He does n't really write much of Family Guy anymore either ...

1 Carniv ? le is without a doubt one of the best TV shows to ever grace the television . Such a shame it was cancelled 4 seasons too early .

1 I like how you were downvoted for getting an error .

1 [ Cate Blanchett and Cat Blanchett ] ( http : / imgur.com / D5Gce )

1 Hold up , you demand for Asian-Americans to be more present in American media and rightfully represented , especially within movies / tv shows where the characters are Asian or inspired by Asian culture , yet you do n't want to do what Black people have done and continue to do for decades , which is talking , fighting , * AND * marching to be treated equally and represented just as equally in the media ? I support Asians ( and any other minorities ) and you 're right , they need to be represented within the American media as well , but do n't talk as if the Asian community make or have made their voices heard just as loud as the Black community . You 're do n't even want Asians to resort to marching or protesting to get their voices heard . You want them to sit down and talk it out . You want the Asian community to get representation ? Go fight for it , and fight for it loud and proud , then when you make your voices heard , other people will join in the fight . But spewing crap like `` We should be able to talk it out '' is n't going to do anything . There 's been multiple Asian entertainers who have talked about their hardships , but guess what ? It 's falling on deaf ears when we live in a society that needs things shoved in their faces in order to get a point across . You talking about how all of that is racist shit , yet your own post sounds as if other minorities do n't deserve to be represent and only Asians deserve it . And of course , other minorities are not going to fight for another minority if that minority itself is n't not even making their voices loud . What would that look like , for example , if the Hispanic community protests for an Asian boy that got murdered and yet , the Asian community is sitting at home , not even aware that it has happened ? Hell , that concept applies even within families or friends . How dumb would it look if everybody was fighting for someone who was going through a problem , yet the person they 're fighting for is n't fighting for their own damn self . In order for actual change to happen , change starts within one 's self and on a broader scale , within a group . The Black community are n't buying phone books and calling up every white person or minority to protest with them , the black community themselves are protesting and making it known of the injustices that happen . Those who find out about it , whether white or any other minority , may decide to join the protest , but nobody is holding a knife to their throats and threatening them to join in . You want change , the Asian community needs to be fighting for change . So no you 're not exaggerating , no it 's not all in your head , it 's not y'all fault either and you all are equal . But if you want to be seen equally , do more than speaking out about wanting to be equal . Show people that you all are and deserve to be equal . And note : I do n't know where you 've been , but I 've seen PUH-LENTY of people fight for Asian / Asian inspired adaptations to have Asians starring in it , notably Dragon Ball , the Airbender movie , and even the supposed Ghost in the Shell Western adaptation that 's rumored with Scarlett Johansson to be playing Motoko Kusanagi .

1 Those films are beloved already , pretty sure In Bruges got an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay .

1 woosh.gif

1 That site is great . Like any list like this , I disagree with a lot of the movies , but its a really amazing place to find directors who have really deep filmographies .

1 George , you a busta .

1 I think that was his way of reminding us who directed the movie .

1 The Soloist is the only one of his I do n't care for . Everything else I enjoyed immensely ; he 's got a great eye .

1 and then of course there 's The Edge , a nice coming of age movie about a bear dealing with two zany outdoorsmen played by Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin . spoiler alert : they play hide-and-seek alot .

1 Because fans take the Star Wars mythology seriously . And they felt Jar Jar was too self-mocking for their pretension to ignore .

1 thats so strange ... because nothing about the trailer makes me want to see this Guess I 'll wait til it hits redbox . No way in hell Im spending the money to go to the theatre and watch this

1 21 and 22 Jump Street were the first two that came to mind for me since they are recent . Both of them are comic gold .

1 He 's trying to channel his inner Harrison Ford getting bored of shooting that scene again and again way past tea time

1 Just thought i 'd throw this in , I live in Hobart , Willem Dafoe walked past my house once when he was in town filming this and i was sitting on the porch . I waved at him . He did n't see me .

1 Yeah , I can get on board with that . Kidman was still really hot tho so there 's that too .

1 I 'd like to know how Darth Vader was a monster . He was a great villain , but not a monster .

1 Yeah same here , so it was more like 60 things you did n't now about Lord of the Rings .

1 > These pics look like a man wearing a special suit . But that 's all we can tell by looking at the picture . The movie as a whole will be what sets Robocop apart from the rest .

1 25 years old here . I would n't know anything about the Last Airbender if there was n't a movie of it . When someone says Avatar , first I think about an icon next to your name on a message board , then I think about the concept as it related to Hinduism , then I think about the movie with blue aliens .

1 No downvote from me , but I do think it 's a beautiful song .

1 Horsedick.mpeg

1 thanks for the link , but you might want to edit it a bit : your link goes to http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Intolerance_ ( film you forgot to close the parenthesis : http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Intolerance_ ( film )

1 Honestly it 's one of the very few times I have felt sick watching something . And that 's saying a lot considering the subject matter is something you have seen a million times in movies , a guy just getting beat up . But something about the way it 's done is just so fucking brutal .

1 The twist is that the last airbender will win 0 of these awards

1 * Yeah ... yeah ... Pocoyo and Lesbian Streetwalkers : An Intervention Documentary . Their recommendations are going to be fucked . *

1 short and sweet

1 Caught the end of that this morning- always a great watch , every frame .

1 X-Men Origins : Wolverine was released in 2009 , bub .

1 On the subject of the images being the wrong way round and the viability of gas canisters being guns.. * [ Does this count ? ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / IDJ2jSL.jpg ) *

1 Actors will come and go - that 's a fact we 're all going to have to get use to . My core point I guess is that I do n't want to see this cycle ( like batman and spiderman ) where a new actor / production team causes the studio to re-tell the origin story . I am perfectly ok with swapping gout talent as needed , so long as it does n't always mean a new origin story * every * time .

1 Guy Pearce was in Prometheus last year and Iron Man 3 this year ...

1 `` Forget it , Jake . It 's Chinatown . ''

1 I thought this too . The only thing I can think of it War Machine was on the other side of the planet and did n't get there in time . A bigger problem for me was the Alien Army falling down dead after the nuke went off . They should 've had them rampaging round the world and the Avengers out cleaning them up .

1 Fucking great movie ( ignoring cheesy parts ) . Good job .

1 I totally agree , the music was amazing during this scene ! I got chills .

1 They actually admitted to doing that with Flynn from `` Tangled . '' They just rounded up a bunch of women , then combined elements of guys they thought were hot into what is now Flynn .

1 Ca n't blame you . I got a screener copy and tried watching it at home . I did start dozing off about halfway through . Not sure about improv ... but it definitely seemed like someone dropped the ball in the editing room . I 'm sure a better cut of the film was more than possible .

1 yes

1 I cant read a book of something ive seen the tv / film adaptation of . Just outright ca n't do it . It 's like getting a summary of the book beforehand . Whereas going the other way works fine for me .

1 Feels like a match up of S1m0ne and Cool World .

1 WTF did you expect ?

1 Or the other great Hudson quote : `` Hey , maybe you have n't been keeping up on current events , but we just got our asses kicked , pal ! ''

1 Here 's all you need to know about the future of the Transformers franchise ... . from the article itself . > ... Transformers 4 : Age of Extinction drew in the big bucks at the box office and broke the record for this year thus far Money talks . It wo n't matter who directs the next film . I do n't have anything against Micheal Bay , but having a new director might actually freshen things up a bit .

1 I 'm glad I 'm not the only who remembers this .

1 Say what again , I dare you , I double dare ya !

1 This needs to be higher , I think a lot of people are confused with SW 's power now as compared to how it was in House of M 6 years ago . She has been severely toned down since the Marvel Next reboot .

1 I think this is so true and even braver to say . It 's like two movies stuck together .

1 I do n't think it 's that Hollywood believes that foreign people are dumb , but that the more people you want to please , the simpler your movie has to be . Some things are very culture specific . Hell , you ca n't even fully understand Godzilla without knowing a little bit about Japanese culture and history and he 's just a giant lizard ripping a city to shit .

1 It 's not the 52nd greatest film of all time .

1 Thank you so much !

1 This movie is incredibly underrated , and one of the best horror movies made IMO . Truly terrifying

1 Dave and Frank go to McDonalds ?

1 Oh I do n't know . By that age they 've probably come to terms with the dark side , and the message , `` Start by admitting from cradle to tomb / ai n't such a long long stay / Life is a cabaret , old chum , / come to the cabaret '' is rather about embracing the moment , since that moment might be all ya got .

1 Oh and some of the scenes were way to identical . The scene at the end where they walk away , the funeral scene , and the whole practice scene which was way better in the original .

1 The image says that if you read the Silmarillion you 'll * know * who Fe ? nor is , the other stuff is specifically from Unfinished Tales .

1 Just go with the flow and enjoy Pynchon 's brand of humor . You 'll be surprised how much you 'll actually retain when you 're not worrying about remembering every little detail .

1 That is playing at the Alamo in Austin this month . That film is such a trip .

1 There must be balance in the force

1 I was downvoting until the the third one , `` San Dimas High School Football Rules ! ''

1 The first is still my favorite , but that 's probably a lot of nostalgia playing a part .

1 I can not wait for this film . So excited . He is my favorite director ,

1 It 's matter of preference . Some people enjoyed it and want to see sequels . You did n't , and that 's fine , but it 's not like it stole and shat on an IP you used to like . So , just do n't go see it when it does come out . Just like I did with Transformers .

1 Those are all torture porn . We 're talking about * scary * movies , not just bloody and disgusting .

1 I meant an official Nova corps ' endorsed personal transportation solution to be ridden by Tony Stark in Avenger 's 3 .

1 I think the exact same thing each time I see that scene on cable .

1 It 's really not the threats of violence , it 's the more relevant threats of cyber-terrorism they 're terrified of . Big-ups know very little about how that stuff works but they think if a huge company like Sony can get hacked , they can be targeted and hacked and Sony and other companies might have a few dirtier skeletons in their closet they do n't want revealed .

1 > They also often use the terms interchangeably , even though they 're wildly different . They overlap profoundly to the point of lacking relevant distinction , though neither of them has much medical validity . Antisocial Personality / Dissocial Personality Disorder are more accurate and cover both .

1 Was the Chitauri opposite the dog ? I got really excited when I saw it thinking it was a Predator inside of it ...

1 [ Relevant Onion article ] ( http : / www.theonion.com / articles / study-87-percent-of-movies-would-be-better-with-mi,19268 / )

1 You are not `` telling the truth '' . Regular 3d movies are 24 frames per second . Every frame is actually composed of two different pictures , each made with different polarizations of light . 3d glasses let one eye see one polarization and the other eye see the other polarization . The left eye image and the right eye image are both at 24 frames per second , and they are superimposed . So you get * one new frame every 0.0417 seconds * . The Hobbit uses a brand new ( to high-budget movies ) filming technique which allows 48 fps projection . That means there is * one new frame every 0.02083 seconds * . So regular movies have 42 milliseconds between frames , while the Hobbit will have only 21 milliseconds . This will decrease blur , and make movements clearer and easier to see .

1 It was all fluff , bad acting / writing , and too much CGI . Ruined a lot of great things too like they mystery ( midiclorians , wtf lucas ? ) . But I love the backstory , it 's quite epic . The clone wars , how that all went down , the rise and fall of anakin even though not as powerful the idea behind it is quite tragic and if it was executed properly would have been great . The scope was on a grand , galatic scale , which opened up the universe and gave a lot of information on how it was run . Episode III was the most watchable of the prequels , mostly for eye candy lightsaber scenes and actually interesting downfall of the jedi and rise of darth vadar .

1 Oh yeah I love when he was being candid , and if he 's the same Kevin Smith im sure he did n't stop talking at an hour and a half haha . Well that 's awesome it 's on YouTube , I 'll watch it tonight , thanks !

1 Indeed .

1 Op , you got us to do your homework .

1 The short answer : yes .

1 jokes aside , he did actually adopt the one in the 90 's era , it was an egg that never hatched , Godzilla fought with Rodan to take custody

1 Love that Major Tom scene .

1 He uses a warming filter to emulate old film ( `` Moonrise Kingdom '' comes to mind ) . Mutes the colors quite a bit . It 's not bad , but I 'd say it 's hardly vivid and colorful .

1 `` * but his weaknesses prove to be his downfall . * `` You do n't say ...

1 I love in Django Unchained when Christoph Waltz explains the story of Broomhilda to Django . The plot of the story he tells reminds me exactly of the plot of Shrek .

1 Not rampage . Do not put a single movie that Uwe Boll has made before your eyes . -second commandment of movie viewers from here unto eternity .

1 Oh , you 'll love Kung Fu Joe . Hopefully it 's terrible enough for you . We tried to make it bad but maybe it is n't bad enough ?

1 `` Maybe you know it but it 's not so easy to finance movies in total . And the reason I am able to do these kind of movies is I have a tax shelter fund in Germany , and if you invest in a movie in Germany you get basically fifty percent back from the government . '' -Uwe Boll . Also , if the movie loses money it counts as a tax write-off .

1 Alice in Wonderland by Guillermo Del Toro , with Timothy Spall as the Mad Hatter . Obviously with a different script from Burton 's too . Not sure who for Alice and the Queens and whatnot .

1 What a strangely random article . Hell , even the author says he does n't know what his point is .

1 * Rogen

1 seriously ...

1 I do n't think that 's necessarily true for all characters , it 's really a situational type thing . Like they did it right in GoTG where they were very light with introducing Starlord and everyone else 's backgrounds . However with someone like Ant Man ? I think you really do need some good background to truly appreciate the character . Doctor Strange on the other hand I could see a light origin story being perfectly fine . Just thrust the audience into some badassry with no context and then develop the backstory as you go along through flashbacks , fact tidbits , allusions , etc ...

1 > the original was all about the privatisation of violence And this new one is n't . Consider it an entirely standalone movie . You 're commenting on the originals relationship with violence , when the new movie does n't aim for that at all .

1 Agreed , and while I did n't like the movie Colin Trevorrow seems to get very natural performances out of actors and I 'm happy he 's working with Jake Johnson again cause he was easily the best thing in Safety Not Guaranteed .

1 I 've never seen the 1st , and considering the story in the movie I would think it was obvious this movie followed the fist .

1 That man really ... really had to return those video tapes .

1 So you 're in a thread called 'Thoughts on Thor 2 ' and you expect spoiler tags ? I 'm going assume you 're new to this 'internets ' thing .

1 Not OP , but [ this ] ( http : / collider.com / guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-james-gunn-interview / ) seems to be what he 's referencing .

1 Yeah I was kind of shocked when they were getting a warm reception in the comments . They all look really similar too . They have like some sort of fuzzy filter or something .

1 Did you have a movie to recommend ?

1 No , it WAS nominated though .

1 Yes she is , and with a well deserved place alongside all those guys too .

1 Double the comments , double the karma I always say

1 Anthony Mackie just went full Harden .

1 This is n't what this thread is about ...

1 We 've been going about this all wrong . This Mr . Stay Puft 's okay ! He 's a sailor , he 's in New York ; we get this guy laid , we wo n't have any trouble !

1 When I watched Shawshank Redemption , one of the quotes Red ( Morgan Freeman ) said to Andy was `` Maybe it 's because I 'm Irish . '' I did not expect that . Upon researching it , I found that it 's because Morgan Freeman was cast to play the role of a white Irishman heh .

1 Got ta get me some prison time , then , because these past 5 years of Spanish classes have done me no good .

1 Absolutely , just make sure you 're in the mood for it and have plenty of rest .

1 Not wrong , but maybe for the wrong reasons . Once you find yourself not understanding the script that 's an adaptation of a 50-year-old worldwide bestseller that , let 's be honest , is not the most complicated story in the world - then maybe a part of the problem is in yourself .

1 Universal Monster movies are the best , man .

1 yeah Mignola 's Hellboy would NEVER do anything so silly . http : / i.imgur.com / AleKISd.jpg

1 While thinking of how to make it fly , he 'll probably fall off his toilet , hit his head and work out how to make it time-travel instead .

1 The Broken Circle Breakdown is tough to watch ( especially to all the parents out there I reckon ) but man , what an amazing film . One of my favorite non-Hollywood films from last year . Great soundtrack as well . Matthias Schoenarts in Bullhead is tremendous as well . This and his ( also terrific ) performance in Rust and Bone , you could see why Hollywood started to take notice .

1 Came here to say this . He used to scare the shit out of me as a kid .

1 Both based on Elmore Leonard books . He 's worth checking out .

1 Haduken !

1 Because it 's a fucking Batman and Superman movie ? The two most well known superheroes finally being portrayed on the big screen together . And it 's being written by an Oscar winning writer ( no , not Goyer ) . > both Captain America movies were really good The first one kind of sucked . I mean it was n't as bad as Thor 1 , or Iron Man 2 ( or 3 , for that matter , but the public is pretty divided on that one ) , but it was n't a good movie . I 'd say it was about as mediocre as MoS . But at least MoS had a memorable villain ( seriously , I do n't know how they managed to make Red Skull boring , but they did it ) .

1 great trailer

1 One of these is not like the others .

1 * PUT DAT COOKIE DOWNNUHHH ! ! NOWAAHHUUHH ! *

1 Yeah , that clip was horrible to watch

1 What about Queen 's `` Do n't Stop Me Now '' in Shaun of the Dead ?

1 Pretty sure Lucas was n't in * Ben Hur . *

1 > Alec Guinness was best known for The Ladykillers and Kind Hearts Um , Bridge on the River Kwai , Doctor Zhivago , Lawrence of Arabia ? ? ?

1 I like how the Tyrannosaur is just standing in the background while the Dragonzord looks all cool .

1 Actually it was news stories he read on Smodcast .

1 Well , working with a buncha green screen drove Ian McKellan to tears on the set of the Hobbit , so that seems like maybe it would lead some credence to the theory ...

1 i just remember people telling me they didnt like it and all i could think of was , whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ? ? ?

1 Only from purely stunt driven action movies is what I heard . I guess he 'll just have to shoot and punch people in this one and not slide down the sides of skyscrapers without safety harnesses .

1 Apparently as Lindir ( Elf of Rivendell ) .

1 I truly do n't believe one is better than the other .

1 It 's funny you say that , because lately everyone 's been suggesting that four actors do everything- Nathan Fillion , Benedict Cumbermatch , Idris Elba , and Michael Fassbender .

1 i dont get it

1 Obviously it 's not their best , but I have friends who think it 's absolute garbage . Then again , a lot of people do n't like the Coens ' comedies and I absolutely love * Burn After Reading * . I also ca n't think of one of theirs I 've seen and not enjoyed .

1 This was downvoted because people thought it was irrelevant , but it 's actually not . If we see a future where people use hookah basically just for flavor and novelty ( which is very likely ) , there will be nothing inappropriate about a caterpillar smoking a hookah . It 's left open to interpretation what he 's smoking , so the context can change with time .

1 Looks like someone has a Pizza Hut sponsorship .

1 Watchmen 's opening titles . Covers nearly the complete alternate history and is , quite frankly , just frigging cool .

1 I assume he crossed the line into annoying , but it kind of is a comedy , really .

1 Shut the fuck up , Donnie .

1 > Dan Schneider Nope .

1 [ Arthur did it first ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=QXbXKgCSHzg & t=1m18s )

1 Who knows here thoughts come from ? They just appear .

1 Know the poster you 're talking about ( the one of Divine on a cloud , pointing a gun ) , it 's in pretty wide circulation . Saw John Waters speak in Philly , and some kid brought that poster to be autographed . Waters signed the poster in really large , goofy letters , `` JOHN WALTERS '' .

1 Do n't have much to add but I agree completely that this movie was pretty damn good . Should definitely be talked about more !

1 Bawn Jorrno

1 The speech he gives once he receives his bonus is legendary .

1 None of what you listed are continuity errors .

1 That 's better dialogue

1 That 's really interesting ! I 've seen another idea that The Hobbit , the real life book , and the movie , is depicted in the embellished way as described by Bilbo in his verbal and written stories . During the barrel scene , did he * really * bounce all around and knock down many orcs ? Maybe , maybe not , but I think viewing the film from the perspective of an embellished tale that Bilbo wrote makes an entirely new experience . Also , it makes it more true to the ridiculous element of the novel as well .

1 Joaquin Phoenix- in `` The Master ''

1 AND you ruined it

1 It only got 50 or so upvotes

1 A recent one is Side Effects .

1 What did he say ?

1 Fuck Jerry .

1 I would add National Lampoon 's Vacation to that as well .

1 Please hide the spoiler next time .

1 I absolutely love it . I also think it 's one of the greatest movies I 've ever seen . In my opinion , the fight scenes are so cool . Sure the acting can be off at a few moments , but the characters and story , to me , is pretty original . I like the soundtrack to . Just a great movie .

1 Do we really have to suck Nolan 's dick in EVERY thread ?

1 Those were supposed be humans ( or former humans , I guess ) which your brain is much more adept at judging than things you 've never seen like dinosaurs .

1 I 'd honestly enjoy both .

1 Ummmm , OP said BAD movies , not works of art .

1 It does n't explain the threatres pulling the film after the `` threats '' or the pinning on NK without actual evidence . Or the studio itself pulling the film , that is the biggest thing . There is embarassing that you said A about person B and then there is `` more than several hundred * million * dollars '' damaging ... What that has come out is worth more than multiple hundreds of millions of dollars US ? THAT 'S what does n't make sense . If there were an obvious answer to why an entity whose sole purpose is to generate money would willingly part with a MASSIVE amount of it just to protect some feelings ... but there is n't . That entire sentence does n't even begin to make sense , unless it is something beyond leaked movies and embarassing emails . I 'd bet it is some sort of concrete exchange on abuse of antipiracy measures or manipulation of opinion on them or propaganda and manipulation of public opinion . Those are the only two things that I could see being bigger than huge monetary losses , to the extent where there was n't even a waiting period they were just like `` lose the hundreds of millions of dollars '' as plan A . EDIT : this is the end made $ 126,041,322 worldwide . Whatever is in those emails is worth over $ 100 million dollars . Embarrassing insults and pictures are n't worth over $ 100 million , and not in a context where the FIRST reaction is to give up the $ 100 million .

1 Until 2028 if Feige was n't lying . http : / screenrant.com / marvel-studios-movies-schedule-releases-2028 /

1 Yeah , remember all the viral marketing for that Cloverfield stinker ? What a bomb . Tell me , did they run that guy out of town on a rail ?

1 Comedy relief is also a good way to ease people into comfort . Think of laughter as a long standing social construct starting before language . That sound in the bushes ? Nope not a leopard . Just a mouse . Haha . All safe . On the flip side you have bigotries imposed by tribal mentality . Someone 's different ? They 're potentially dangerous . They 're an outsider . They 're not to be cared for . Laughter is an indicator of safety . When early comedies featured a gay , black , or dwarf character it may have seemed token , but if you were laughing with them , your brain was saying `` they 're not a threat '' . By sharing laughter -- or even just enjoying a movie that exposed you to them -- your brain is conditioned to see their humanity . So even if he took hackey roles and never helped coach others ' he would have still made a large cultural impression .

1 He does n't break until after the DVD commentary is finished .

1 Austrian

1 My favorite was the one at the end of Xmen 3 to get you all excited for the next movie , then they decide to restart the Xmen franchise .

1 When will you people understand that * robots are erotic ! ! ! *

1 The woman whose entire life is incomplete without a man . Ugh. Also , the typical inept male who ca n't ever seem to do anything right .

1 Plus , you can team-build afterwards by trying to figure out the plotlines !

1 I have gift cards , so yeah , they 'll treat me to that movie .

1 OP watch Gattaca

1 Indeed . If a conservative in this country was going to boycott every movie that had someone behind it who had `` morally reprehensible '' political views and was active in support of those views ... ... ... they would probably never be able to see a single Hollywood movie on any topic ever . ... and we would all call them insane for boycotting Hollywood just because of the political views of the actors , writers , producers , directors , and , in fact , the entire organization behind the making of movies .

1 The end of `` The Grey '' was breathtakingly amazing to me .

1 ... or they may not have been . They certainly did n't play the same role though .

1 https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? feature=player_detailpage & v=qbHVhXlbYWA # t=312 skips the first 5 minutes and gets to the cringe .

1 Sorry , but you just said Fight Club and Memento were overrated , but did n't say the same about Shawshank . I 'm sure you 'll edit it properly soon enough .

1 Looks like this was released 1 year after the dinosaurs tv show , which means it was probably conceived and written during the height of the popularity of the show .

1 You do n't have to be a nerd . I went in completely open minded , and wanting to love this movie . Instead , I got : * A villain who I never felt was much of a threat until he actually decided to fight , which was what ? ... The last 20-30 minutes of the movie . * Terrible pacing / editing . It feels like there are HUGE chunks missing from acts I and II of the film . * Kal and Zod flying through buildings got extremely old . We get it , they 're really strong and can do that . I 'm glad you loved it , but the same way people loved it for whatever reasons , there are those of us who are n't as fond of it for our reasons . This film was marketed as * The * superhero movie , so naturally expectations are set high when you 're gon na do that . Instead , it turned out to be okay . I do n't hate it , but I 've seen better . I know nothing of Superman , so why was n't I blown away ? The action sequences were great ( when they were n't flying through buildings ... ) Henry Cavill is a great Clark / Superman . The cast was great , even the score was pretty good . Cinematography was nice , but there are other aspects that bring it down . I 'm sure I could list movies I love that you do n't like , for whatever reason , so to just go ahead and say we 're being `` nitpicky '' is pretty ignorant .

1 Transformers : Age of Extinction - Best Picture .

1 If that guy manages to revamp his career back into a good drama and pull off that role , would be insane . He was really good in The Greatest Game Ever Played . Then went downhill . : (

1 You ca n't but that does n't mean they ca n't have purpose to their existence , or characterization .

1 And better than gaog 's spelling .

1 They mean the blocks looked so realistic that it looked like they were physical pictures .

1 I was about to point and laugh at you for the Nolan brothers comment . But I decided to check out IMDB first . TIL .

1 Of course they have .

1 DAE think [ _________ ] ( http : / www.reddit.com /r/movies / search ? q=underrated & sort=relevance & restrict_sr=on ) is Underrated ? Take a drink .

1 `` We all look like that . We 're serious ''

1 Heard on the radio a week ago that she just signed up for a 3 years permanent show in Vegas . Apparently , she will save the city from bankruptcy or something .

1 Batman 's no-kill code generally does n't apply when he is blowing stuff up , In just about every version of the character . Nolan , Burton , Animated etc .

1 It is known ? I mean , all I see is a couple of pictures that could have been taken anywhere . I do n't see any case or anything like that . I will accept that after the first news came out , there were a couple of big people in hollywood saying `` it was about time '' or something like that . Buuuut that 's a personal opinion of them . Not exactly the most reliable source .

1 Not the same Anderson

1 Have n't seen it , not planning to either . I do n't see the point since I know exactly what happens

1 With alarming frequency

1 For your own sake do not do what you are about to do . You do not understand the enormity of the quagmire you are about to put yourself through . Amos & Andrew is our generation 's Viet Nam .

1 Really ? He 's becoming bigger by the second .

1 Yes .

1 Runtime : 137 min | 152 min ( special edition ) | 154 min ( extended special edition ) Really * barely * but I guess it counts for the special editions .

1 I really recommend Cyrus . It 's a great movie . It 's everything Jeff Who Lives at Home is n't .

1 I ca n't believe it ! The OP finally showed us how to complete the owl drawing . ; p

1 And I do n't get the hype about american handegg . Still there are plenty of peopel enjoing it . tl : dr opinions

1 More Emma Stone in everything please .

1 Most of the comments here I thought were relatively positive , I 'm a big fan of the original , and saw it when it came out as a kid , this is n't a remake as much as a modern retelling , it works pretty well and brings the same kind of fears I guess people had in the eighties into a modern context .

1 Go watch The Wire , Elba was fantastic in it .

1 This is n't Brett Rattner we 're talking about . Nolan is a guy who lives and breathes every film he makes , obsessing over every detail , the Batman movies included . No one who 's just looking for a solid paycheck and entry to the mainstream goes the the trouble he does to create something above and beyond the average popcorn movie .

1 Surprised Two Days One Night did n't make it and it was never going to happen but I would have loved for The Way He Looks to get some recognition . Ida has to be a sure thing now

1 Yeah , I do n't really see the appeal either . It was clever at times , but overall I did n't really feel like there was much to it .

1 No , I got it , just thought it was a funny / relavent-ish anecdote involving him throwing things .

1 Even not to make a movie but to get the Oscar he so richly deserves .

1 Ray Manzarik was on the set of The Doors . He said when Kilmer walked out it was like Jim was alive and walking by . Pretty much sealed the deal for me . I like Walton , would n't like to see another movie about The Doors .

1 [ An old version of Tom Cruise is already in the movie ] ( http : / imgur.com / TjGjPGM ) I think one Tom cruise look a like is a enough .

1 That 's in my watch list ... I saw it in the flood of 'unknown movies ' posts , and through it in there since it peaked my interest .

1 Watch out folks we 've got a big man here

1 She walks through mid-air and creates steps anywhere she wanted . You could climb everest in a day like this .

1 Same , which was really disappointing for me . The Hobbit was my first fantasy novel , and remains in my top five , and I love love love the LOTR movies .

1 Eight year olds , dude .

1 I 'm fine with him handling crazy g-forces while he 's in the suit ... he 's got a super energy source and super science that handles that . It 's the scene where he 's testing out the rocket boots the first time and goes straight into a wall wearing only the boots where I ca n't help but think `` aaaaaand dead . ''

1 Governments killing people is just wrong . But I could get behind reintroducing outlawry .

1 Hmm.. you should check out the comic called `` Invincible . '' It explores this same idea that you had . It 's a fresh take on a superhero 's backstory .

1 In all fairness , I do n't think an artist 's `` track record '' should influence the outcome of an award that 's supposed to be awarded based upon a single performance .

1 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo teaser trailer . I liked it .

1 The Rock - I tear up when those fighters come screamin ' in under the Golden Gate Bridge as Nic is laying there dying .

1 That would actually be a really great fit since she 's in the same age range and plays a similar character on GoT . It might put some of the game fans off a little though , since she looks absolutely nothing like Ellie . Aside from that , the only problems I can think of are possible scheduling conflicts and whether or not she 'll be able to do a believable American accent .

1 Kiss my buns .

1 Gilbert Godfried absolutely murdered it on the last roast

1 Moonrise Kingdom or Grand Budapest Hotel

1 Memento is one of the best .

1 You may have just described every Bollywood film ever .

1 You see , I like Star Wars . I think the films I saw as a kid are great films . Those are the films I want to see on Blu-Ray . I 'm just very confused why it has to be changed each time it is re-released . If I were nitpicky in asking for certain changes and not others , that would make me an entitled fanboy , but I think asking for the best possible quality of the theatrical release is n't too much to ask . Of course , I already have those thanks to a good torrent , so whatever Lucas does with his baby at this point is on him . It 's sad , but I do n't sweat it .

1 * `` Strange , is n't it ? Each man 's life touches so many other lives . When he is n't around he leaves an awful hole , does n't he ? '' *

1 * Certified Copy * A Separation * Uncle Boonmee * Black Swan * The Tree of Life * The Act of Killing * Holy Motors * The Master * Under the Skin * The Grand Budapest Hotel Those are the ones that are gon na be remembered in 20+ years from now from the first half of this decade .

1 Good lord they made seven fucking Saw movies ? What the shit .

1 ... I do n't think it 's a shot for shot remake ... In fact I 'm pretty sure you just made that up ...

1 Joe Hisaishi 's music is so fucking beautiful.. Spirited Away , Castle in the sky , Howl 's moving castle , Princess Mononoke , Hell even the creatively weird ass Pom Poko is great , and do n't forget Porco Rosso , Love that movie.. The wind rises is pretty cool too but I think a film you need more patience with than the others . Oh gosh Totoro , adorable through and through.. Grave of the fireflies.. ; - ; SO FUCKING SAD . And so much more , that studio is so freaking spot on , I love all of their work and I watch it religiously , the dubs are amazing , I usually watch subs when it comes to that kind of stuff , though I do n't watch much anime at all ever anymore , but it used too be subs but with this , the dubs are SO good . Quality all around .

1 But he s just so beautiful .

1 its not , its from Justice league unlimited aka season 2 of justice league i think .

1 City of Ember was interesting yet flawed but not bad . There were many aspects of the film I enjoyed .

1 Dude . Irish accent white Ras , robot scottish accent white Bane , and French accent white Talia are not believable Arabians , or even Tibetans like they were apparentlyssupposed to be in the film , or even relatives like Ra 's and Talia were .

1 > Hemsworth and Johansson might be big actors but the characters they play are minor . Um ... thor is n't a big character ? ( no pun intended about his size )

1 Surprised this is the first reference . Look sharp reddit , now 's your opportunity to use the phrase 'Byronic hero ' .

1 Did n't Leo even make a joke about it in his speech ? Something like `` thanks to my fellow comedians : Christian Bale , Joaquin Phoenix , and Oscar Isaac . ''

1 I think Takashi Miike is a pretty accomplished director . It 's not fair to compare him with Tom Six . [ Imprint ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0757061 / ) in particular is rather impressive , if you can get past the bad ESL actors . Stupid Showtime should 've just let him do it in Japanese .

1 I bet the flood never comes and Noah murders his family in the boat . Sounds like something Aronofsky would do .

1 I think they did n't overdo it in this case . The bloom was n't overdone , but gave it a sort of 'spacey ' vibe . The smoke and mist makes sense because it was set over a gaseous planet and I did n't think it obstructed anything more than some of the monster , which I feel adds to the very mysterious feeling I get from this . I really did like , though , the camera , and how the shaky shots were only to enhance the sense of speed , or storminess of the planet , and they did n't do the bulllshit 'hop between ships ' kind of thing , which makes the action hard to follow .

1 Earth has breathable air but you can still get sick from it . There 's no justifying it .

1 Perhaps it was just a guess in-universe , but generally when a character speculates like that in a film or work of fiction and is n't directly disputed within the work , I think there a certain understanding that it is actually the writer 's own opinion on the event . Like , if it was just supposed to be a random guess , why would it be in there at all ? see here - > http : / tvtropes.org / pmwiki / pmwiki.php / Main / TheLawOfConservationOfDetail Of course , you do n't always have to take the writer 's word for things that are n't fully proven in the film . In this case , it seems like the only real intention , in my opinion .

1 This will blow your mind : that did n't blow my mind .

1 That is English ...

1 suck on this a one time !

1 / thread

1 Actually Lost Weekend seems not dated because of how stark and non-Hollywood it is for its time . The only thing that dates it for me is that dame with the old-fashioned slang dialogue . It was the 40s equivalent of a black character who says things are `` dope '' and `` wassup my nigga . '' Wilder 's films fell prey to this kind of dating slang dialogue . Some Like It Hot seems incredibly dated because it 's so Hayes Code in how it handles the subject matter , drag humor has been done to death since then , and it 's glaringly obvious that homosexuality is never mentioned or even implied at any time .

1 While true , `` Nominated for an Oscar '' in this sense is used in reference to the Oscars that go to movies that are good overall , not sound mixing or special effects .

1 I fixed it . Thanks .

1 He also kept referring to Frank Oz as Miss Piggy .

1 He was just in the intro

1 I 'll agree > I dislike Sofia Coppola because her movies always start with an interesting premise and a really good execution but after 30-40minutes they just lead absolutely nowhere , have 0 depth and the only thing one could potentially take away from the movies is how tragic a rich persons life can be ( read : boring , it 's just boring , that 's their misery , so deep . )

1 It 's an idiom in the English language that means putting in a minimal amount of effort for something .

1 It 's not just his face . It 's his demeanor and the way he embodies his characters . And yes , even his voice .

1 Luke is a bit slow getting the joke .

1 I would assume the people funding it ? They 've spent a shit load of money in making these , so I can understand why they want it to fit in the universe . I agree that it would n't bother me , but I 'm sure it would bother some other people who bitch about continuity and how not everything meshed . And I 'm sure the people pouring money care about the films because that 's what they 're supposed to do .

1 I smoke weed too ! !

1 IMDB Top 250 : # 192 8.3 / 10 17,309 votes ? It 's certainly worth watching .

1 UGH. Satan then , * whatever * .

1 Even Now , After All This Time , I Am Aware Of What You Did Last Summer !

1 Each frame is a jpeg2000 .

1 Absolutely horrible movie . Also , Hellen Mirren has aged well . Still totally doable .

1 Yeah because it would have been impossible that , if the boy still had been alive , a mob would have lynched him thinking he was a terrorist . So yes shit like spreading such rumors can kill people as well .

1 It was refreshing to see gratitude , even in an unexpected place .

1 That 's quite the accomplishment considering that there are only 10 films in the MCU .

1 It 's just ONE character and she 's in it for the money . Which is a lot . Fifty grand a day .

1 Well , I just watched Casablanca for the first time and it was pretty great .

1 According to IMDb , he 's making a new movie called Trainwreck ( 2015 ) . He 's also involved in producing some other stuff , you can check his page there for more details .

1 Just because you do n't agree and ca n't think of a convincing arguement do n't blow off his opinion . To be honest , if I had n't been told what this picture was I 'd have no clue . It 's comparable to a picture of a musician in a studio during recording . You 're seeing parts of the process that you do n't get to see when you 're not involved in the industry , and that 's still fascinating to fans . Saying it `` cheapens the art form '' is idiotic , uninformed and elitist . A picture of some construction work is not going to make me enjoy ANYTHING more less but if you really care that much , the title was pretty explanatory . You did n't have to click on it and cheapen your eyes .

1 I really would n't go as far to say she was great . I would look at her for a moment then realize how infatuated I am with the woman ... then she opens her mouth . Rinse and repeat .

1 Let 's see you keep it together in that situation .

1 That is not what downvotes and upvotes are for .

1 I ca n't think of a nice way to say this list is terrible . But it is . : /

1 Jurassic park , original tron , toystory 1 , terminator 2 all still look fantastic and probably always will . Simply because they used the special effects and CGI appropriately the films that look awfull and tend to age the worse are not because they used primitive or limited CGI its because they used inappropriate CGI .

1 Yeah , like that guy who recut Star Wars .

1 Inflation wo n't change which film grossed the most in a given year . This graph is comparing the Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each year 's box office topper , not how much they made .

1 I thought the whole painted background was a reference to that film .

1 When you left me , I left Earth . Does that not show you I care ?

1 I 'm probably not going to bother . I liked The Hobbit far better than the LOTR trilogy because of its simplicity . Adding all the extra lore , whilst it must be exciting to * fans * of the series , does n't really attract me , being a more casual viewer that 's a little turned off by lofty high fantasy .

1 A ) You think when he was globe-trotting in a private superjet he spent a lot of time sampling the local cuisine ? B ) You think when he was locked in a cave by terrorists they made sure to give him a culinary lesson ? Rich people and geniuses both can be remarkably unobservant of their immediate surroundings . He 's both .

1 Except I loved Sandra Bullock 's ass .

1 This was in development long before Frozen came out . Does n't stop it from being a bad movie , but your comment is kind of presumptuous .

1 I just think that Ford 's style was perfect for it . It was basically 1930s Han solo .

1 District 9 . Every time someone says `` fook '' . Take two if they say `` fooking prawns '' .

1 They Americanized it . `` Happy Christmas '' sounds seriously bizarre to American ears .

1 I liked the movie enough to be confused by the bad reviews . Either it 's great or I love bad movies .

1 I saw it because that might be the most hilarious 3 minutes of Archer ever .

1 Early reactions say the CGI is incredible , and that you could tell they were n't even close to being done when the trailers were released . I certainly hope that 's true , because while there were some amazing CG shots in the trailers , there were a few questionable ones , for sure .

1 His eyes are three different colors I . This trailer . Green as banner starts to hulk out , brown when he 's all 'sup to scarjo widow , and red when he 's all , I shall fight all my friends . He 's a 100 % CG character , if his eyes are noticeably red it 's for a very specific reason .

1 WE ... .HAVE TO GO BACK KATE ... .WE ... HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE ISLAND !

1 It is one of the more famous boards on 4-chan , known for generally screwing things up , like the `` Dub the Dew '' contest awhile back .

1 Absolutely , give it a try

1 Would see . 10 / 10

1 * Daaaad *

1 > ~~roll~~ role FTFY Regardless , at this point she is about as well known for being an intense drug addict as she is for playing Princess Leia . If anything she might do it to update people 's image of her .

1 My god ! I foresaw half of these comments !

1 If Heath had not passed I think DiCaprio would have played the riddler along side the joker . Would have been very interesting to see .

1 Okay .

1 Gravity is worth the 3D , I did n't see in IMAX but still the 3D is n't just slapped on

1 Sean Connery beats his wives . [ Roger Moore gets beaten by his wives . ] ( http : / www.telegraph.co.uk / news / celebritynews / 9537467 / Sir-Roger-Moore-James-Bond-actor-beaten-up-by-first-two-wives.html ) That basically tells you all you need to know about their respective portrayals of Bond .

1 15 with an 18 'unrated ' cut for Blu Ray . That 's my bet . Swearing is n't an issue that much anymore for the ratings and as long as it 's not Evil Dead level of blood , there 's a chance it can stick to a 15 .

1 It is so beautiful and disturbing . The most beautiful thing I have seen in a movie in years . I love that movie so much .

1 Why did everyone hate The Incredible Hulk ? I thought it was pretty damn good .

1 That movie is awesome .

1 I absolutely loved it . I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie . Yeah the acting is silly but for whatever reason , I really enjoyed the story

1 A lot of people think it 's against science . It 's pretty clear though that Shelley supports innovation , but is advocating for responsibility and maintaining a balance with nature . The creations of science are not to blame for the evils inflicted , but the men who create them and warp their use and perception through incompetence and neglect . Basically , If I were casting for a Frankenstein movie , I 'd cast Tom Hardy , Javier Bardem , or Benedict Cumberbatch as the Creature and Will Ferrel doing Ron Burgundy as Frankenstein because that character is such an asshole .

1 `` You forgot to take out the trash again . I asked you to do it yesterday , it 's starting to stink ! ''

1 It completely came out of the blue did n't it ?

1 no .

1 Oh god , I loved Rambo .

1 Oh yeah . Before Parks & Rec , he was in * Wanted * Bride Wars * Jennifer 's Body And after Parks & Rec * Moneyball * Zero Dark Thirty * Her * The Lego Movie * Guardians of the Galaxy * Jurassic World Though , like a lot of stars , he has been in a few stinkers after Parks and Rec like The Five Year Engagement , Movie 43 and Delivery Man , but I can certainly see him being one of Hollywood 's A-Listers by next year .

1 Indeed , because it has a budget of $ 38 mil , not $ 250 mil . True Grit only made $ 251 mil from box office .

1 Ricky-O is FAAAAR from new , but is awesome .

1 Well , Conspiracy Theory with Mel Gibson is a pretty good start

1 I 'm glad he did n't do that . Replacing Ledger in the very next film would have been a horrible idea .

1 That quote is not in The Good , The Bad , Or The Ugly .

1 I 've tried other Hepburn movies and could n't find anything I liked , but Breakfast at Tiffany 's - I * love * that movie . And not just because of George Peppard 's eyes , although they were distracting . And in spite of * everything * about Mickey Rooney 's character , which was oh [ god ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / 8LHXcir.jpg ) , * so * bad . But then [ Moon River ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=NhRg_38gq-k ) happens and bam , madly in love with Audrey .

1 I 'll probably give up soon , but I 'm reposting [ In Defense of Nicolas Cage . ] ( http : / scottalanmendelson.blogspot.com / 2009 / 03 / in-defense-of-nicolas-cage.html )

1 I feel like Veronica Roth sat down and started brainstorming by thinking , `` Know what 's cool ? Tattoos and piercing ! Know what 's even cooler ? Shooting guns , throwing knives , and fist fighting ! Know what 's the * coolest * ? ! JUMPING OFF OF TRAINS AND ZIPLINING NEXT TO A HOT BOY ! Alright here we go let 's write a book . ''

1 inb4 dark sci-fi action thriller by Fincher / Nolan / Arronofsky with JGL , Scarlett Johanson , DiCaprio scored by Hans Zimmer .

1 You mistake my argument ; I 'm not saying that films that adhere to their source material is an inherent good . What I am saying is that the Swedish interpretation was worse than the story in the actual novel ... which the American version * happened * to stay truer to .

1 All the chains I 've seen have at least one link that is a simple bent circle . My guess is , chains are meant to break away if they get caught on something , to prevent the wearer from choking to death .

1 Of course not ! It just so happens that the parts they added were clumsily done . It seems to me they were done for the wrong reasons ( extend runtime , include familiar characters , fit in more action , include a love subplot ) . I can look at any of the changes in LotR and say , `` Yeah , I see why they did that for the purpose of the film adaption . Well done . ''

1 There was Scott Pilgrim and ... ...

1 Gets me away from Reddit for afew hours .

1 This reminds a couple of days ago someone on Reddit jokingly complained that at the beginning of The Thing ( original ) you get the whole prequel-remake spoiled for you if you understand Norwegian . So in that case the director was expecting audiences not to understand what the apparently mad Norwegians where screaming during their crazy helicopter dog chase and its catastrophic conclusion .

1 The Fourth Kind with Milla Jokavich . Terrible movie .

1 whats a * karma * ?

1 When I first saw the film at my age I looked * exactly * like Piggy with similar glasses and social ineptitude . Certain scenes did n't bode well . Not to mention I watched it with my dad . Seeing what looks like an exact replica of your kid killed by a falling rock ca n't be great .

1 It punched me in the face too and said , `` Haha , now I 've got your 10 dollars and 2 hours of your life . ''

1 I absolutely adore this movie .

1 Did a chinaman piss on your rug or something dude ?

1 It also has an autobot that is apelike in appearance and speaks in ebonics .

1 I feel like it 's an AMAZING short film that they bloated the hell out of to make it into theaters .

1 I learned the significance of Adaptation by one of my literature professors . Essentially , Charlie Kaufman was hired to make an adaptation of the book `` The Orchid Thief '' ... ..but he got writers block and eventually just said 'fuck it ' to the original story . This is easily seen in the movie . So my literature professor always said that the film Adaptation is a horrible example of adaptation , but a great example of creative film making . I dunno if y'all knew that . But when I learned that I found a new respect for spike jonze and his crew . So , props for puttin it in there ! Edit : The book `` The Orchid Thief '' is nothing like the movie adaptation .

1 And his reportedly fast dog .

1 Greatest sort of sequel ever

1 Well it 's mainly just the fact that SHIELD has a stockpile of Hydra weapons . It 's suspicious but they cover it in the same scene .

1 with unique but sophisticated names like Ulysses and Roxanna

1 Except Starbucks tastes liked burned ass and cigarette butts .

1 One of my favorites . It never fails to make me smile : [ Amelie AKA Le fabuleux destin d'Am ? lie Poulain ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0211915 / )

1 Dude is a sociopath .

1 I agree . Too easy a target . He 's a clown for sure , but this is like writing a `` scathing '' restaurant review for a crappy diner .

1 If you go with Hannibal , I think you have to take the Ray Liotta brain eating scene over Pazzi 's death .

1 That 's like , your opinion , man

1 So watch it tonight ?

1 It all depends on the size of the sign and the amount of work required to install it . I managed a repair job once for a high-rise in downtown Philly . There were signs on 3 of the sides of the building . Two of them had outages on several letter , one was completely out , but each sign was attached to the side over the edge of the roof . In Philly , mostly union work is required , and it 's a busy street , so we had to have a three man crew , one of which rappelled from the roof , and police to block access to the road . Each sign letter was about 6 feet tall . In the end , we replaced tons of lamps and a few ballasts . One of the signs just had the switch turned off somehow . Total billed for labor materials and misc was ~ $ 60,000 . That was just a repair . Aside from the sign itself , installations can include surveys , artist renderings , engineering drawings , permits , and inspections .

1 To me they are synonymous with a wall of movies I do n't care to watch , and a staff of high schoolers who do n't know dick about movies , and do n't want to be there . Really , movie rental places were kinda fucking terrible , and I do n't know why anyone would lament one of these large chains closing down . I would much rather browse from the list I compiled of dozens of movies I actually want to see , order a pizza for delivery , and press play . I never have to leave the house to find a parking spot , wander around a store full of slovenly , shitfucking heathens , to not be interested in anything they have , interact with a staff of morons or pay a late fee because I did n't have the time or forgot to drive back to said shithole .

1 James Cameron is fucking awesome

1 From Iron Man ?

1 Only reasonable answer here .

1 That was always my assumption as well . The only reason they do n't normally do that is the potential to get attacked by an agent , which he doesnt have to worry about .

1 What I love about that is the freaking scientific approach Spielberg took to that . He filmed that scene in different ways , cuts and added different music cues , timings , etc . And then he tested it on a bunch of people , showing them the different versions . The one that got the by far loudest scream is the one in the finished movie .

1 He might think it 's a cold call .

1 This is what I came here looking for as well . I consider it the perfect movie . It has so much balance to it . The part where he brings her flours , the look on her face when she realizes what he has done is absolutely beautiful . And the ending sequence , oh god , so beautiful .

1 This has to be the only answer to this . It 's every real president should aspire to be , and it helps if you have that deep awesome voice to let everyone know you 're in charge . I also liked President Taylor until the final episodes of the final season when she went completely dark side .

1 [ I believe that , just look at what happened during jaden Smith 's latest movie screening . Apparently it was n't very good . ] ( http : / youtu.be / 0APF3SO9tqE # t=3m4s )

1 `` Oh , that 's Cosmo ... he 's Chinese . ''

1 aw ... .NOW I HAVE TO WATCH ALL OF THEM ! ! ! Thanks though I did n't know that .

1 But avatar did n't need to be boiled down . It was legitimately exactly the same as Pocahontas . White guy in advanced army falls for indigenous girl then turns against his army in favor of ways of the Indians .

1 this . he totally looks like John Cusack .

1 It was when [ Stark was taking Hawkeye to the top of the building right after they broke from their huddle ] ( / spoiler )

1 I found too much focus on the human characters story

1 I 've been meaning to see this movie . Not as anything serious , just for shits and giggles .

1 At the very least it ruins the attempt at social commentary . They 're essentially useless so there 's no good reason to keep them . Traditionally they would be somehow essential , but unwanted and it would be necessary to keep them oppressed and performing the jobs that nobody else wants to do . Instead the best they seem to have is some sort of `` barbarians at the gates '' concept , but then they obsess over their population . It 's not like their pressure performs an essential function on the rest of the population . It 's even more unnecessary since nobody can leave the train so you always have tremendous external pressure even without them .

1 Django is half Jewish .

1 Bloodsport . Jean Claude Van Damme in the role of a lifetime .

1 You bastard .

1 Seriously . That movie is amazing .

1 That thick sliced bacon and sunny side up eggs ... It makes me angry how hungry that causes me to be .

1 You sir would definitely make it in Hollywood .

1 The Fountain future scenes were a kind of organic inspired sci-fi that was intriguing . Noah on the other hand was a full on fantasy epic , I'l not religious at all , but enjoyed it as a stand alone LotR style fantasy , it kinda works both ways I guess . The rock monsters were baller . I think he 'd do mad justice to something like the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant .

1 Woah ... that 's pretty darn cool

1 I do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . I disagree with your statement , but here , have an upvote .

1 That canon system was erased , with all new products and the movies being part of a new canon . Cortosis survives through one of the new novels though .

1 Here 's the relevant text that / u / JamesBondRadio first reported , for those of you who are lazy : > So , we ? ve had word directly from the casting agency working on Bond 24 that there will be a classic villainous henchman in Bond 24 ? > ? We are looking to follow in the tradition of JAWS and ODDJOB in finding an iconic baddy . > Hinx ( Male , 30 ? 45 ) > Ideally over 6 ? 2 ? . Hinx is the main henchman / assassin . We are looking for an imposing extremely physically fit actor . He has several fights with Bond and will have to have stunt training . He has to drive . We are looking for someone very unusual , possibly from a sports background . > Height : 180cm ? 195cm ?

1 It made me laugh . It seemed like one of the most realist parts of the movie .

1 im going to get downvoted for saying this but fight club is a great movie but every 13 year old boy sees it and sees the anarchy and they think its the shit and it they 're like the only one to ever see it ; real talk , everyones seen it .

1 Not downvoting , but I totally disagree .

1 Why are you being downvoted ? This is a valid point ... Old school Godzilla was a globally recognized character during his time . His appearance made him who he was .

1 [ Here is the scene . ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=-ITOSkfkpU4 # t=15s ) I think it was just water dripping from something . When you said pour I was very confused because I did n't remember it .

1 Aye yippey aye oo !

1 I was about to commend hair and costumes for their amazing duplication ... As well as the actors for their spot on body and hand positions ... But then I looked more closely

1 He was definitely doing a decent attempt at a Scottish accent

1 Wait wait wait ... Was that a Death Star ? Holy shit I 'm hyped ! Edit : oh man and that Imperial March theme playing ... .

1 I feel like the entire movie was one huge 2001 reference . Or homage , I guess .

1 Three months actually , also 35,000 Karma .

1 The funny thing with her in Total Recall is that she was fairly convincing as Quaid 's wife , but the second she changed to her actual character it was a terrible performance , almost like his actual wife was just screwing around with him .

1 Link the whole quote , bro . > Mel Gibson has long defended his father , telling a reporter in 2006 , ? My father has never told me a lie. ? Gibson said of father ? s Holocaust denial : ? * He never denied the Holocaust * . He just said there were fewer than 6 million ? Jews murdered in the Nazis ? concentration camps .

1 And that 's the story of how Michael Fassbender came to America .

1 Fox News

1 Thanks . Imo , it 's all about what threads you chose to wander into . If the thread says `` PACIFIC RIM made $ 200m Overseas ! '' I would n't expect the participating users to really tolerate criticism of the movie . But if the thread says `` Let 's seriously talk about Pacific Rim , '' you 'll gold for critique .

1 Paragraphs . Use them . TL ; DR Mass Effect movie .

1 What 's the deal with all the pickles man ? ! We drink beer ! Just watched it today actually

1 Me too . I thought Tobey was a terrible Parker . While the Garfield movies definitely have their problems , him as Parker was n't one of them .

1 I hope it 's great , but of what I 've seen so far , I 'm not too excited

1 Actual quote from the movie

1 Moss has come a long way .

1 I enjoyed the hospital scene with his wife . `` We wo n't rest until we find who was responsible for this ... but first let 's grab a bite to eat . ''

1 I like how he just passes out in the diner after it 's all over But seriously , we need to go to a hospital ...

1 Why the downvotes ? This is accurate . It is in fact quite possible that the whole movie is one big dream , including the last scene .

1 PG is actually just Parental Guidance * suggested * . I think you 're thinking of 14A - for which anyone under 14 must be accompanied by an adult ( does not have to be a parent ) . However , movie ratings in Canada are actually set provincially ( though not every province has its own board ) , and this info is for Ontario .

1 In the book , the Extremis thing kinda helped him become superhuman-ish . He could regenerate like Wolverine .

1 Thanks !

1 Maguire was never really the problem , the writing of the Peter Parker and Spider-man characters was .

1 If the evidence was still admissible , `` rogue '' cops would `` against orders '' illegally search people all the time , then take the slap on the wrist . The reason why it 's the way it is is because individual criminals even in the most heinous of cases , are nothing compared to a police state run amok .

1 He 's not a good actor , and he definitely should n't be the lead in any movie , but he can do okay with minor parts that are within his scope .

1 It 's not his best film but it is definitely underrated . I certainly enjoyed it .

1 Is anybody else ( other than you and I ) getting a bit sick of all the anti-cars 2 posts on r / movies ? I 'm not interested in seeing the movie , but every other post ( it seems like ) is boo-hoo'ing how bad this movie is / is going to be ...

1 Yeah let 's go inside a dark and creepy looking cave inside Area 51 that 's a great idea !

1 Oh , honey . Enjoy 1995 . I know I did .

1 Mmmm , then you can sit back and enjoy a nice ice cold refreshing [ coke ] ( http : / www.coca-colastore.com ) . Why not ? After all that hard work , you 've earned it .

1 President Snow probably had him killed in a different way in the book , but in the movie he ate them .

1 he does n't get it to spin . He fumbles and it rolls around in the sink .

1 Totally when he says `` bravery '' you just feel it and Eli Roth just embraces . Top it with that Ennio Morricone score and it 's just movie magic . One of the best scenes by far .

1 Has n't everything already sorta been discovered , by like , Magellan and Cortez ?

1 I like the Doctor Who approach of having no real official stance . I suppose the presence of time travel and alternate timelines allows people to resolve most contradictions that inevitably arise , should they chose to accept anything from outside the show .

1 RIP MrMadcap Died November 26 , 2012 Cause of death : Bravery

1 I would have to assume Superman came first .

1 Porco Rosso is perhaps one of my favorite anime films ( outside the one 's I 've mentioned in my own comment ) . Love WWI era stuff done right , flying aces , etc . Caglisotro is a great introduction to [ Lupin III ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Lupin_III ) , for those unfamiliar with the franchise .

1 I 'm not sure that it would mar his public image , because the idea of it is hilarious , but I can understand his frustration .

1 I think the credits clearly state that its Zoe Bell..

1 Holy turd blossoms . Except for the Jackson Pollock joke , of course .

1 Trying to make the third movie the best of the three is a pretty high target . I found the second merely an enjoyable popcorn flick , but the first was a stunningly good film . If they can truly surpass it I 'll be incredibly impressed .

1 Yes

1 I think it 's their sense of `` call to action '' overcoming their belief that they are putting themselves at risk . They 're reasonably certain that it is n't wise to enter that dangerous situation , but they would feel guilty if there was something they could have done but did n't do because of caution .

1 For people who are artistic , talented , and able to write masterpieces , having your work stolen is the worst thing that can happen Then some shitnag trying to pass it off as his own ... there 's a special place in hell for those kind of people I personally would n't mind punching shyla bitch square in the face for this , just on principle alone

1 I had the same reaction

1 I recommend you take your own advice .

1 I wish there were more mainstream movies in which nudity is n't there as a `` big deal '' , but like a normal thing , something that is n't supposed to be there necessarily to elicit a reaction from the viewer . European movies do this very well , in my opinion . American films almost always try to `` sensationalize '' it somehow .

1 the snow sequence in that movie is unforgivable

1 That 's not even a three-point landing . But should we just ban people from kneeling because Trinity already did it in Matrix Reloaded ?

1 Hey ladies , you want to try my mouth-based video game ?

1 You are just everywhere now .

1 Erm , when did I say the alarm clock was better than the copypasta ? I do not care who wins . I am saying the behavior around it is embarrassingly obnoxious .

1 You worded that well . I want it to be good , but I 'm mostly just hoping it 's `` funny and watchable '' bad and not `` bland and forgettable '' bad .

1 As a French speaker I 'm not sure what would be more annoying to listen to , Mirren 's `` pretty good '' French or yet another English put-on `` fake French '' accent . Since it appears they have compromised and settled on some kind of franglais-derived patois to suit the imagined tastes of Ohioans , all I can say is , well done . Box office gold .

1 This was my interpretation as well . You can see all of the characters begin to become irrationally angry or irritated during the scene in the lab . Some of them ( Natasha and Tony , at least ) look confused / ill as well . Right before shit hits the fan , the camera starts taking weird-angle shots ( indicating their minds were being played with ) , notably the one of Thor where he says , `` You 're all so petty ... and tiny ! ''

1 And now for something completely different .

1 The Wind Rises was nominated last year and lost to Frozen .

1 That was genuinely one of my first `` check several times a day '' websites . I was so bummed when they moved to a different site and format . I moved on to AICN , and it never lived up to Coming Attractions for me .

1 You arent the target audience . Just ignore it , many people enjoy it , you dont have to

1 The fugitive . The shooter is kind of crappy but it 's an okay action movie . And eagle eye is visually cool .

1 That 's funny cause I did n't notice it and am actually thankful that it was pointed out .

1 They are n't occasional . They are in EVERY episode .

1 Dr.Stephen strange

1 Things like that is the difference between a Michael Bay directing and a Spielburg directing . Look at every cut in this scene , the build-up is so perfect . I remember seeing this in the theatres back in 1993 and even today is the greatest movie experience of my life . This scene itself made me feel that anything was possible since the emotions of The first-time-seeing-dinosaur-impact was being transferred straight from Jurassic Park to 12-year old me .

1 See , I had the same feeling . Could n't watch it again . But for some reason this week I 've been thinking about it , and it really hit the spot .

1 This is n't an official announcement

1 That 's really cool . A nuance I never noticed . Probably cause I 've always been too amused with how `` 69 dudes ! '' flew right over my head as kid .

1 `` gobble gobble motherfucker ''

1 Oh YEAH , I forgot about Predators . Actually , that was n't that bad of a flick ... ..I 'd agree out of all the Predators and AVPs , I 'd rank that 2nd ( only to the original Predator ... .get to the CHOPPA ! )

1 It was n't filmed specifically for the movie , it was fortuitously found stock footage .

1 Great pick . It has one of the best climax & ending in recent memory .

1 I got goosebumps when Robert Carlisle 's character is running from the horde to this music . Epic moment .

1 Agreed , I liked this one just fine .

1 Mrs Ghostfire should be the sequel . I would watch that .

1 in defense of the hobbit , the book is a lot more of a kids story than TLOR , so its safe to say the movies would be as well . though i do agree that making one book into three movies is entirely unnecessary

1 I think Menace was the worst but I also thing it was closest to being the best . A second draft could have but it on A New Hope level . I might be misrepresenting but I felt like episode one had the best acting because it did n't suffer from the sitting on couches problem that the other films did .

1 Do n't we all ?

1 I think this is the final product .

1 No idea . And I 'm a girl . I was watching Hunger Games and kept thinking , forget Peeta , get the camera back on Katniss ! That girl is fine !

1 everybody knows that the timelines of these movies are a mess .

1 It is , it 's just really random

1 [ No he did n't . ] ( http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Han_shot_first ) In the original , Greedo never shot at all .

1 You just have to search for casting calls or even get an agent . Eventually you can join the screen actors guild and they will let you know about what kind of people directors are looking for in their up coming films .

1 Aww , did you feel left out , Martin ?

1 None of us have seen the new movie , I 'm countering the `` this movie looks terrible '' posts with `` this movie looks good '' posts . The guy above made a blanket statement about all of his movies . The difference is actually pretty self-apparent .

1 He 's been planning this for ages ! The look on your face !

1 I agree .

1 I came here just to see what GF was an acronym for ...

1 I 'm a fan of all the lead up movies and I think the movie does the idea of multiple movies leading to one movie justice . I absoultely loved it . I was kind of apprehensive that with so many characters some may be overshadowed , but Joss knocked it out of the park . The humour and banter between all the avengers is brilliant , the set pieces are spectacular and for those who have watched the lead up movies the emotional part is quite a hard hitter ( I honestly shed a tear ) . The one point that had me fanboying my pants off was the camera fly through the city which showed each avenger doing their own thing , but at the same time having the presence of mind to help each other out like a proper team . Seeing Hulk finally done right was awesome . HULK ... Smash

1 TASM2 only felt rushed because of all the shit they shoehorned into it to set up the 5 other movies in the franchise . They cut to MJ stuff to fit all that shit in there .

1 They wanted the title to stay in English , but `` hustle '' is a bit too advanced vocabulary for most French people .

1 I was going for gaudy ( it 's more accurate ) , but both apply . Take your pick .

1 Thank you . I kept trying to explain this to friends but it kept falling on deaf ears .

1 > despite notable omissions like Heavenly Creatures and Amelie Amelie is an entertaining movie , but it 's nowhere as good as Delicatessen or City of Lost Children .

1 That red dress ... .

1 Because the studio needs to actually make money ?

1 Well , the joy of the movie is not in its ending I 'll tell you that ! So , by all means see it .

1 chaaaaappsssssstttiiick .

1 No problem ! That 's all I could think about when that scene was happening . Plus it was fun to type out .

1 That 's hardly surprising though . Mechanical units are easier to look more realistic for both CGI and animatronics ( a model in this case ) . The mostly geometric parts and generally simple movements are easier to simulate . Compare robots to organic beings or monsters . The difference in detail and especially in movement control becomes much more apparent between CGI and animatronics .

1 Yes ! Fantastic cinematography and a compelling soundtrack , although not perfect this is probably one of the best family films of the past few years , with an important ( if blatant ) message . All cliches / plot conveniences / product placement aside you can have a great time with this charming film

1 `` Love is n't a box that gets filled up Theo , it grows and grows to include more ... '' - Or something to that effect . She did n't stay with the human ideas and feelings of Love .

1 Smells like rotten eggs in here .

1 He comes off as smug .

1 i think this post says more about the op than it does about jurassic park

1 > I do n't think it 's fair to compare the quality of them like that . There is no fairness in film criticism . But more specifically , comparing movies based on `` the core idea '' of their plot is very reasonable relative to other stretches that viewers make in film vs . film arguments .

1 Maybe the ones at a distance were CGI , but that 's just how it goes with huge scenes with lots of extras . All the orcs that got major facetime in LotR were in makeup .

1 Just now !

1 Do not want .

1 Not to mention how the studio finally scrapped their own cuts after they tested poorly and just said , `` alright Aronofsky , let 's use your cut . '' It 's a director 's cut . An ARONOFSKY director 's cut . Fuck yes .

1 Yeah , but there 's a statute of limitations on shit like this , and we 're well past it .

1 I can see why the mods censor you .

1 I saw that , too , and thought * Michael Palin * was still hilarious.. He had a show going around doing that sort of thing after Python , so it is n't like he was decades out of practice . They were all hilarious , really . Even the new sketches they slapped together for those parts . That being said , it sucks that Graham is n't still around . EDIT : Traded Pythons

1 You should .

1 I 'm hoping this gives them a chance to develop that universe a little bit more . Between the games and movies , there 's a * lot * of meat there that really has n't been explored to my satisfaction .

1 If you want the original theatrical releases , those despecialized editions are the absolute best / closest you 'll get .

1 Hangman Justin Cat ... .Poster

1 Part of the theme is Man 's evolution . It shows Man 's first use of tools ( The femur bone ) that allowed him to procure a steady diet of protein ( meat ) and allowed one group to take dominance over the other group of hominids . People say that the actors are stiff and mechanical , that is by design . The humans are becoming more machine-like while the actual machine ( HAL ) becomes more human . Look at the Discover spacecraft . It looks like a skull , spinal column and pelvis symbolizing the merging of man and machine .

1 To be fair , I do n't think most people did need the explanation .

1 I believe OP may have mistyped , and meant they * do n't * allow their children any of those things .

1 I 'm just upset that they still try to make them smaller than full movies . An hour and 10 minutes can be a good movie , but they would feel far less rushed if they did and hour 40 .

1 Yes

1 Ah ! Now I have to listen to the whole soundtrack

1 Nickelodeon . Cheesus

1 I think he 's just joking / trolling .

1 Not his debut film , Hard Eight came out the previous year .

1 Upvote for this . Acting might be questionable at times but since the movie is pretty much real ( ex- ) SEALs doing SEAL stuff the gun fights were as realistic as you can get I guess . Should be considering they used a lot of live ammo . http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=mTaRhMBGzkY

1 TDKR has substantially larger pacing issues .

1 when it comes to climbing , skinny is preferred to beefy

1 PUT ... ... ... ..ZE ... ... ... CANDLE ... ... ... ... .. * BACK ! *

1 John Wick was a fun return to 80 's action that pulls it off without skipping a beat . It deserves all the praise it gets .

1 The mask too ! That was weird , would n't it have been more effective to get costuming to make a mask instead of adding the mask as CGI ?

1 Only because being so topical will never attract a long-term mainstream audience , only a cult could love it beyond 2014 .

1 I actually almost pissed myself laughing at that part . I think I laughed for about 5 minutes .

1 The point is n't that people are karma whoring . It 's that these kinds of posts are pointless , annoying and detract from the subreddit .

1 That was ad-libbed . Who thinks of tapping a knife blade to the eye spontaneously ?

1 Sure , she was doing her job , but the way in which she did it showed her to be a pretty horrible human being .

1 Robocop 2 , while not a great story and with a decentralizing plot , is a * great * commentary on sequels . In the movie a bunch of executives are rushing the production of a character called Robocop 2 , a bigger and `` better '' version of the commercially successful character called Robocop , which is being rushed , has too many hands in the pot , and eventually becomes this over-complicated lumbering mess that does not go over well . On top of that , those very same executives over-encumber the original concept of Robocop with directives that water him down and take away what made him so great .

1 I was hoping Joseph Gordon-Levitt was going to play the DKR because of that .

1 First world problems

1 It 's directed by Harmony Korine . That should be enough to know it 's way more than just a teen movie .

1 This is n't an Al Pacino thread .

1 About having kids .

1 Care to say why ?

1 I would normally agree with this but making 2012 in 3D would possibly be the greatest idea of all time .

1 its also funny that they took the time to stop and stand there in the middle of the mayhem just to utter those cheesy lines , terribly awkward and stilted delivery imo

1 Probably Christopher Walken 's monologue about the history of the gold watch . It 's tragic , and comedic . Poignant and sincere . I actually did the monologue in theatre class as a freshman in high school .

1 I just left the rating alone .

1 Most of the answers in this thread are the obvious ones , your Collateral included .

1 I think that there 's a lot more things that are involved when making a movie . I 'd say they 're on a tight schedule .

1 There are much worse films out there .

1 Ok , I 'm going to edit this and put a more thorough review .

1 `` Hey ! Say 'Nevermore ' ! '' `` Fuck you . ''

1 Oh I 'm well aware of the meme .

1 Yes , that was absolutely the most painful cringey sex scene I 've ever seen . I loved the movie but I 've never moved from amused scorn to gut-wrenching pity for a character so quickly .

1 Uncastable ? What does that even mean ? And how does it apply to him ?

1 You 're kidding yourself .

1 That 's not what he 's talking about at all .

1 What ? Hitchcock is a giant fucking deal in the horror / thriller film world . He was there long before Goldblum was in the Fly . The Fly is one of my favourite movies of all time but holy shit are you ever wrong about what the perception of horror films was to the Academy . The dude was nominated 5 times ! Then he was given an honorary Oscar for being a huge importance to film . His big thing was mysteries , horrors and thrillers ! Horror films have never been overlooked until they started being crass .

1 They were great friends . You 're thinking of Abbott and Costello .

1 Hey , even Kubrik put a 2001 soundtrack album into A Clockwork Orange .

1 I think the comedic moments in 12 years a Slave are intentional .

1 I do n't think the actual nature of the MacGuffin needs to go unexplained . From my understanding , the nature of the MacGuffin is rather just inconsequential . It could be a suitcase of money , a bag of microprocessors , some white castle burgers , it does n't matter and long as it 's something desirable that moves the plot along .

1 Yep , this is it in a nutshell . All the ideas being thrown around here would get extremely old after a few minutes .

1 * 2001 * ! Dunnnnn ... .. * Dunnnnn * ... . * DAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH *

1 This one is based on http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / The_Double_ ( Fyodor_Dostoyevsky_novel ) and anything else with the same name thus takes the back seat . If you by 'get to have ' mean in the legal sense - who knows .

1 Excellent point . Maybe he needed a place to charge his game .

1 Sorry , but you can .

1 I have to say , I 'm looking forward to this more than any other Marvel film

1 Attrition I guess , no one punch is gon na stop him , have to wear him down as much as possible . Plus - It looks kewl .

1 I 'm given the impression that it 's made from a more `` futurish '' looking material . Think carbon fiber , but better .

1 That 's the exact opposite of everyone I heard who saw it EDIT : 95 on Metacritic , 100 % on RT with 10 reviews counted . What Selma are * you * talking about ?

1 I ca n't be the only one who thought the previous movie was a bunch of melodrama filled with pointless CG action ? It had none of the charm and personality of Sam Raimi 's Spider-Man .

1 Awesome . I love Will . He was my favourite on MadTV .

1 while most people only read headlines , investors tend to read the `` this didnt't * really * casue damage / this actually * increased * sales '' parts , and I 'm sure these are actually shown to them even if kept secret from the public .

1 I wish people would pay me for not sleeping with them .

1 I agree with you ... but yeah , apparently it is blasphemy .

1 > I 'll catch it on Netflix or Redbox Should n't have to wait too long , either . It wo n't last in theaters .

1 or , you know ... people like me who work second shift ( 3pm-11pm ) and decided to catch a late morning showing . Which by the way was my second time seeing it !

1 But if it 's his memory , he might be imposing how he looks in the present time on his recollection .

1 I wonder if these films would have been more accepted and enjoyed if they were better movies . Things we 'll forever ponder but never have answers to ( until fan edits ) .

1 I do n't really think it 's about the bad side effects of smart phones / social media . I got the impression it was more of a film about how our social standards have conformed around the these things . I 'm really interested in seeing it , but I do agree the anti-smart phones thing is super annoying .

1 And by confusing I hope you mean amazing .

1 Yep . I 'd add in Pan 's Labyrinth as well

1 Yes you should

1 Correct . / u / exileonmainst1 is referring to Thor 2 however .

1 > 1 . `` Glac ? '' is a shitty title . To be fair , so is `` Frozen ''

1 Apparently it 's Brad Pitt in this movie .

1 What Christian and I set out to do was to create a character * dramatically * different than the one he played in LEVERAGE . Yes , both characters are tough people , but I think you 'll be surprised at how far he stretches for the role . I think he was surprised too .

1 It was an allusion to the phrase `` From the feet up '' that a few of the characters used . I liked how the camera 'randomly ' focused and zoomed on Amy 's side boob and ass . What a woman !

1 Clerks 3 has been in the works before mallrats 2 .

1 At some point of its life it was .

1 My phone is off in a theatre . For you to assume otherwise and then wish my family ill ? ? To my main point . To the people who do text in a theatre , tell a manager , move , get a refund . But get a grip too . No one need die over a cell phone .

1 [ Spoilers ] ( # s `` She returns in Skyfall '' )

1 No oscars for sure , but I thought they were good fun . I waited till they were on cable so I did n't have to spend theater money on them , but still thought they were fun .

1 IKR ? ! The fact all these cis shitlords consider this a joke hurts my coffeshopkin feelings so much , I ca n't even !

1 Let 's hope so .

1 I think he 's more annoyed with the kind of people who so often create indie-movies . People who want him to more or less volunteer his time and money for a film that will probably suck , and then he does n't even get credit for it . At least he 's paid very well with the Marvel movies , and at least with them , he works with other professionals who have been working in the industry long enough to not waste his time .

1 ? ? How was the main plot stolen from soylent green ?

1 Those were n't nuns . Those were doctors wearing plague masks . http : / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Beak_doctor_costume

1 To be fair , they were never `` real '' dinosaurs , they were genetically engineered frog / dinosaur mutant hybrids ( Alan Grant calls them `` monsters , not dinosaurs '' in JP3 ) . Thus , the exact sizes , appearances , and behaviors can be inconsistent and still be justified in-universe .

1 What an asinine thing to say . Firstly , not all moviesthese days are 90 minutes long , so your clearly spewing shit from your face hole there . Secondly , from what you say it seems you believe that longer is always better , when really , the pacing of a movie is all important and when a movie runs too long , as is the case of Jesse James , the overall experience can be hugely damaged . That 's not to say that I do n't enjoy methodically paced , slow moving films , 2001 springs to mind immediately . Having said that , pacing is still an absolute cornerstone of good film making and Jesse James let me down in that regard .

1 Awwwwww *

1 * such funny * - * much laugh * - * wow *

1 `` This is a gala day for you ! '' `` Well , a * gal a day * is enough for me . I do n't think I can handle anymore ... ''

1 I have a feeling they decided to scrap the whole idea of Peter 's father being alive for the future movies , which is why they went ahead and included it here . Probably just included it to show Andrew Garfield 's acting skills .

1 I 'm not even talking about effects , really . I think a lot of the presentation is dated . I like Verhoeven , but that film just feels so stuck in 1990 that I barely detect any of his style on it . * RoboCop * was 3 years prior , and while it definitely has that 80 's feel to it , I think it is a bit more timeless . Like this scene , for instance : [ http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=V17duGlHEYY ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=V17duGlHEYY ) . A small bit really focused on special effects , and I think the effects actually hold up ; you can tell they are n't exactly new , but it still works . But the costuming , the set design , the quality of performance from minor roles , the music ... I 'm not saying it is * bad * but it is just * so * 90 's and a lot of those tropes have aged so poorly that it is hard for a lot of the film to be anything but silly . It always had a bit of silly , campy , strange to it ... but the action and more interesting sci-fi elements are rendered in a way that is almost parody of the early 90s action movie , and it 's hard for me to view it on its own merits the way I can with , again , * RoboCop * , which displays its `` 80sness '' without being overrun by it . Does that make sense ? I 'm sorry if I am explaining / rambling poorly .

1 I do n't see much utility in complaining about a movie you have n't seen .

1 The sad part is , it 's not even relegated to young kids these days . I had to endure half a row of 50-60 year olds blathering through the entire run of Gravity until my group finally told them to shut the fuck up . Same for Prometheus , I had a whole family ( kids were early 20s , parents 50s ) trying to talk over each other beside me . Then some shithead behind me one time started yelling at my friend while he was taking off his coat and getting ready to sit down ( the trailers had n't even started , the lights were still on ) because his shitty brat wanted to watch `` the deodorant commercial '' . People fucking suck , period .

1 > Storm trooper with NO helmet . As said elsewhere in the thread , it could be a rebel disguising himself like Luke did . That said , I love the idea of humanizing `` the enemy '' .

1 Or you know , you can pay to see the movie .

1 Unfortunately I 've seen that , sorry , I 'll edit the description . Thanks anyways mate : )

1 No Fincher has never written a book . Maybe you 're thinking of the guy who wrote Fight Club ? Chuck Palahniuk ?

1 Yeah ...

1 Fuck you for calling me xenophobic . Seriously , this is tiring . I dislike product placement made sorely for pandering . My fucking bad . I prefer movies sticking to a good script , rather than pandering . I do n't mind movies referencing China . This is n't even about China . It 's about pandering . Also fuck you again , I 'm sick and tired of people like you . I got a hundred fucking comments like yours . Stop being offended all the time and calling people racists even when they did n't say anything remotely racist . Stop wasting your own time with stupid accusations .

1 If you watch it in vlc you can set the speed to 1.1x Then it is only 141min

1 It was n't meant to look real . It was meant to portray a highly stylized live-action comic book feel , not unlike Sin City . As long as it 's obvious that is what the film is trying to do , I can immerse myself in the movie with no issues . On the other hand ... Badly done CGI ( the kind that people complain about ) typically attempts to fool the moviegoer into thinking that what they 're seeing is the real thing . And when it fails , it takes the viewer away from the story and shatters the immersion . That 's the difference .

1 Anywhere he wants . Though presumably he 'll live mainly in Metropolis , near his job .

1 In the first Superman movie , there 's a joke where he 's looking for a place to change and does a double take at the [ newer fashioned phone booths . ] ( http : / i.imgur.com / 9GCMXYH.jpg )

1 Abnormally ? More like 'exactly like every year ' . Come on , there were some good movies , some bad ones , we had a few great ones and a few disappointments .

1 Monsters U at -4 ? One of only a few movies on this list in the negatives for a reason other than being double posted is Monsters U ? People actually think this movie deserves that ? When did it become cool to hate this movie ? It was great and a wonderful return to form for Pixar . What a bunch of nonsense .

1 Never trust a guy in a tunic . Words to live by .

1 `` Gosh , those people only liked that musical for the music . How unsophisticated ! ''

1 And yet these days they 'd try to use CGI anyway . The body falling off the cliff would be CGI . The wounds would be CGI . Probably one of the characters would be a CGI hawk . Etc . Most movies do n't `` require '' CGI , but it seems like most contain superfluous CGI * or * were greenlit mainly because they provide a vehicle for showing off CGI .

1 Except it made almost $ 3billion , so the studios are n't exactly going to leave it alone now .

1 You 're parents did the right / most hilarious thing . : )

1 uhhhhhh

1 They should really include the one that was in the water , too . The overhead shot of watching that giant creature swimming upward to swallow Wander from the dark abyss below still gives me chills .

1 > Sharlto Copley for Bruce Wayne / Batman . You mean The Joker ? Yes . I could see that .

1 Well if you read what Spielberg thinks about it , he was fairly disappointed too .

1 It has been spoiled for me but hey , what can you do ? haha

1 I know exactly how you feel . All of the receipt-paper tickets I own ink has become faded . I actually have to pencil in the heading to keep the title visible . I now choose my theaters on the quality of their ticket stubs , believe it or not .

1 Exactly .

1 Yeah but you missed the part that Godzilla is basically indestructible and can fry King Kong with one radioactive plasma shot .

1 I 'm convinced 3D stereoscopic projection * can * work out for entertainment , if we stop getting these half-assed `` 2.5D '' movies like Clash of the Titans . Important to note though , is that IMAX is a big part of modern 3D movies ' appreciation . I saw Avatar on all different offered sizes ( IMAX 3D , normal cinema 3D , normal cinema 2D , bluray 2D and normal 2D ) , and the difference between each step is huge . IMAX3D was a treat . On the other hand , HP7 on an IMAX screen almost made me sick to my stomach ( shaky cam was terribly done ) , and Jackass 3D on a regular 3D screen was awesome . Clash of the Titans was just annoying though .

1 Is there a source to this ? Ca n't seem to find one .

1 It is the only scene in any movie I have ever seen , that I will leave the room for now .

1 Who ?

1 The whole thing was a disaster by way of the writers strike . Daniel Craig had to write some of those lines and he 's vowed never to do it again in a situation like that .

1 [ This could help . ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0394243 / )

1 I 'm saying be open minded . Sure you can read reviews , but I usually do that after watching a movie . Some movies I have ended up really loving have had like 5 point something rating on IMDb .

1 I agree it 's just a great monster movie . A really really great monster movie .

1 * tips fedora *

1 To be fair , its a bit different .

1 I share your frustration . I ? ve found that the best way to get around the problem is to keep searching through subtitle download sites until I find an exact match for the release of the film I want to watch . Sometimes this means downloading and trying several versions of subtitles , but it is far easier than messing around with delay and speed ratio settings . If it is absolutely impossible to get a version of the subtitles which perfectly syncs with the film , open your subtitles file with notepad , check the timing for the first subtitle , compare this to the timing for the first line of dialogue in your film and set the delay accordingly . Provided that the speed ratio is OK this should usually work . If the speed ratio is not OK , and the subtitles gradually come out of sync with the film , you can use the ? g ? and ? h ? keys ( if you are using the latest VLC player ) to make incremental adjustments to the subtitle delay as you watch the film . I find that this is easier than adjusting the speed ratio itself . Good luck .

1 the kind that spends 80 or so takes trying to get her to do it right before just saying fuck it .

1 I enjoy it .

1 Because it 's been 400 years .

1 Yeah , I enjoyed MoS for what it was , but that S was supposed to stand for * hope * , which is something we did n't see a lot of in that movie . The attempt to Nolan-ize it is what did more harm than good and kept it from being a * great * movie .

Jaegers were always very fucking expensive and towards the end they were literally being destroyed too fast to replace , even if resources had n't been diverted to the wall . Building the wall just meant that the Jaeger program would fail earlier , but the failure was inevitable since the Kaiju were coming faster and strong as time progressed .

1 Biff , is that you ? He just wanted an autograph .

1 * shivers *

1 For me it was pretty much the entire movie .

1 How is her not using a glass in the scene a continuity error ?

1 My personal theory is niether . He is obviously a very manipulative man , so i think that at the table he sensed how incredibly uncomfortable shoshana was , and forced her to stay after everyone had left , to see if there was anything suspicious afoot , using his mind tricks to make her uncomfortable . Even if he did know it was her , He only wanted to fuck with her .

1 That 's the only review of The Happening anyone needs .

1 Yay

1 Yeah ! I was thinking wow you do NOT fuck around with the councilmembers , what are their motives , this is just levels upon levels of comple- oh its just fucking black widow

1 holy fuck yes . It would be amazing to see this story done right . That or Most Dangerous Game .

1 Yep .

1 Great movie , great ending .

1 Yes , I too watch honest trailers .

1 Your reading comprehension leaves something to be desired . As does your temper .

1 Well to be fair at that point it was probably cheaper to rip up the floor and rebuild it later than to rebuild the whole damn set .

1 Judi Dench = Bond Girl

1 Wrong again .

1 And /r/movies IS N'T a circlejerk filled with people who have n't realized that cinema existed before 1994 ? Whoops .

1 Okay , when you start a sentence with the words 'I do n't want to sound racist but ' you are going to sound racist .

1 It 's just after five different remakes of the origin story of the same superhero , you get kind of fed up .

1 Midway was good , apart from the Charlton Heston scenes with his son .

1 Well they 're both David Vs Goliath themes really , the good guys up against overwhelming evil forces . Even some of the characters are comparable : Luke / Frodo , Obi-Wan / Gandalf , Emperor / Sauron , C3PO & R2D2 / Merry and Pippin , Legolas and Gimli / Han and Chewy , Darth Vader / Saruman , Stormtroopers / Orcs . Obviously there are other non-comparable characters but objectively they 're very similar story lines when you get down to it , just depends if you prefer sword and sorcery or sci-fi ? I 'm a sword and sorcery kind of guy myself ...

1 It 's a little hard to see through the glare from his tinfoil hat , but I see him .

1 Y'know every time a thread asks for the most traumatizing / violent / disturbing / depressing / hard-to-watch / everything that 's bad ... It 's Irreversible . And I still consider it one of my favorite films .

1 I [ like ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=wIgFbqRngjA ) * The Dark Knight * .

1 It turns into a total mess after 2 . Clive influence drops in favor of generic S & M images . It also gets stupid in ways that make absolutely no sense .

1 It 's not for everyone . To be honest , * I * really enjoyed it , but I walked into it knowing that it was a simple movie ; Giant robots beating the hell out of giant monsters . No more , no less . If that 's not your cup of tea , then you 're going to have a rather unenjoyable 2.5 hours by trying to sit through it .

1 He had a pretty good role in Lord of War too .

1 You can already see it now- `` Directed by Michael Bay '' .

1 My bet is that it will be on lists of `` forgotten classics ''

1 Hey everybody , / u / spikedmo was going to say the same thing !

1 No .

1 /r/bestofnetflix often has some awesome suggestions .

1 Whaaaaaat ! ? A year ? ! They better do the ending PERFECTLY .

1 It does n't look like them to me . The credits and IMDB do n't list any actors as the old versions though , so maybe it is them or they 're uncredited

1 But that 's what reddit does . Gets the wrong people killed in pointless witch hunts and then fails at getting shows un-canceled .

1 * Shoot an arrow , we do n't have time for lightning ! *

1 I know right , I watched it twice and then was like , `` I 'll be godamned if I 'm not gon na watch Will Smith say 'Welcome to Earth ' at least one more time TONIGHT '' .

1 I think it 's hilarious that the U.S. is still making red scare propaganda films .

1 cool ... ?

1 I just watched Donnie Darko yesterday And loved it . The first couple times I had seen it before were uninteresting to me because I was too young to understand what was going on .

1 Oh ... I thought you were his navel . Now I feel let down . ( I 'm actually Aquaman )

1 I feel like 3 AMA 's would have been more effective than 4

1 I 'm glad they do this . Saves me from having to watch a shit film .

1 Must ... resist ... downvote.. for.. opinion ...

1 1930 's - there were no episodes . There was no T.V and there would only be one animated movie by the end of the decade . There was usually a short opener before a movie . Something funny to lighten the crowd up .

1 I take it you 're not a Psych fan then , James Roday ( the main character and producer of the show ) is a MASSIVE 80 's nerd and goes far , far out of his way to cast people from popular 80 's movies and shows .

1 The Conversation ?

1 IIRC , there were n't any females in the book at all .

1 That 's what I liked about it . Spider-Man is n't about a costumed hero . It 's about Peter Parker and his choices to be the hero . Peter Park is the focus . He is the important aspect of the film and the comic book . It is n't his swinging through NYC . That 's icing on the cake . Peter Parker is one of my favorites because despite all the terrible that befalls him , he continues to choose to be good . He continues to choose to save people . He continues to be that damaged hero to save people from themselves and hybrid animal villains that are always ten times stronger than he . He is constantly David against countless Goliaths and though he 's strong , it 's his dark wit that unnerves the villains enough for him to get the upper hand . Those are his stones he slings to bring them down . I would only hope that if I were blessed with powers of any sort that I 'd be as valiant as Peter Parker . He has every reason not to be . He could pity himself and be angry to the point of vexation . He tires to save them all as his life is in constant need of repair .

1 So we 're critiquing the ads that the theatres play before the movies with the same standards with which we critique the movies themselves now , huh ? God bless the Internet .

1 the girl next door leaves you similar

1 From what I 've heard , this is even more abstract than To the Wonder . I do n't think he gives a shit about critics .

1 you should see 7 part 2. it 's actually pretty good . I understand you being upset that the movies are different from the books , but also keep in mind that at this point , pretty much everyone in theaters has read all of the books and knows exactly what 's going to happen . It makes sense they 'd want to throw a few monkey wrenches in the mix to keep audiences on their toes and keep a little suspense alive . If you watch a movie and know the plot forwards and backwards because you read it already , you 'll probably enjoy it less . So I do n't think it was that bad that they took these liberties . Harry and Ginny end up together- so is it that bad that they have a few intimate moments together ? The Burrow burning is a lot bigger , but does n't * really * affect the plot that much . It was enough of a shock to catch people off guard , but they did n't kill off any pivotal characters , they just blew up a building that was n't going to be used much for the rest of the story anyway .

1 Sure ! The process is relatively simple , although somewhat time-consuming . I did this completely in Photoshop CC , utilizing the 3D tools that are available . To get the rock and fossil-like texture , I used a hand-painted bump map . Using different variations of grays , blacks & whites , I created different levels of height on the map ( Black being farther away from the camera , white being closer to the camera ) . The Ember-glow from the claw comes from a `` self illumination '' map . Basically , whatever color I painted in there acts as a light source of sorts . The main lighting comes from an environment map that I made using photos from Hawaii , as well as stock photos of fire & lava . I added additional ambient lights for taste , and a curved adjustment for overall tonality .

1 Well , Hollywood does love China at the moment , so we can hope they take notice of China 's major cities ' aesthetic and stuff . I 'd rather see it there than New York

1 Are you implying that those movies are good ?

1 http : / i.imgur.com / K7S61KC.jpg

1 I saw that movie with some of the actual airmen . It made me feel pretty bad they saw their heroic lives turned into such a shit film .

1 One of the reasons that I love that movie is that Nicholas Cage , who curses in every movie he does , does n't curse . Sean Connery , who does n't curse in his films , curses up a storm .

1 Galaxy News Radio ?

1 I vote for Cate Blanchett . And name her 6 . Or scottish actress Lindsay Duncan .

1 Whose car are we going to take ?

1 you hear that bubbles ? its the sound of the whispering winds of shit .

1 Did Jay ever say he likes Trash Humpers ? From what I 've heard his favorite movies are Eraserhead and Videodrome .

1 If Spider , X-men , Batman , Hellboy , Blade , Iron Man , and all those other films had n't have came out . GL would have been a much better movie . It seemed very much like undeveloped stories . As a comic book reader , I found it sad that they chose to ignore the comic . Parallax is a fear demon being who turn Hal Jordan into an insane Lantern who killed the corps . Even more so it 's the embodiment of fear which is worshiped by Sinestro 's yellow Lanterns . In the film we get a cloud that eats planets . The damn thing does n't even talk to Hal . It 's only purpose is to serve as something to fight . Then we have another bad guy who honestly should have been the only bad guy . Why did Hal even have to fight him ? Then of course they used Hal Jordan . I like Ryan Reynolds , but Hal Jordan is in my opinion a terrible character . He 's a loser with magic powers . He 's not a loser because his life sucks , he 's a loser because he 's responsible for all the failed relationships and bad choices he made . He 's a pretty white boy whose only problem is that he ca n't get a particular hot chick ( even though he 's already banging one ) and sometimes has fear while flying a dangerous vehicle . Kyle Rayner is a struggling mexican artist , John Stewart is a black architect , and Guy Gardner is a good guy but has anger issues . Then the biggest shame is that they show us the Corps and they were far more interesting then anything else in the movie . Go watch Green Lantern Emerald Night , First Flight , and Justice League Frontier to see what this movie should have been . Hell they all feature Hal Jordan but it all works .

1 Artistic intent . There 's a difference between 16:9 and 2.4:1 and directors who want their movies to be bigger will pick the latter . It 's the same reason why paintings are n't all made on the same sized canvass .

1 Don jon was surprisingly good btw

1 He was the highlight of Seven Psychopaths , I can see him killing it in a Tarantino movie

1 alright but dont listen to that guy , hes saying xmen vs avengers , avengers vs galactus , galactus and xmen belong to FOX studios , its a mess with characters so NO they probably wont go whatever route this dude is talking about due to character restrictions .

1 Sounds like invasion of the body snatchers

1 I do n't think Looper is presented as a very fun movie . It 's pretty dark . SPOILER I mean , Bruce Willis kills a kid .

1 just the angle , looks normal source : have seen tits

1 No , it 's definitely not a comedy . Probably somewhat similar in tone to Moneyball .

1 No it was actually a standing ovation for Morgan Freeman , the camera got Leo off guard . I do n't know if it was prior or after he `` lost '' the award to Clooney .

1 You should watch , if you have n't already scene it , It 's a Wonderful Life . So good .

1 Me too , but I 'm not smart enough to know which number it represents . I 've never reached 2048 in the actual game and I 'm praying this is 2048 in this game ! ! !

1 The city of Columbia seems to be modeled around Federal architecture and Americana , both of which predate the city by 50-75 years . Its interesting but I do t think it will ha e the same vibe as being trapped below the ocean in an art deco paradise . Its after midnight and I suddenly want to go play Bioshock . ; )

1 Link Flair ? WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !

1 I am pretty sure it is a standard 35mm projector for 20 min . reels I can tell you that it is a Carbon Arc light source for sure . The handle on the back end is the main power switch from the generator which was probably located in another room since they made too much noise and heat to keep in the projection room . In the last picture the pointy thing sticking up from the bottom is one of the carbon rods used to make the light . There would have been another one coming down from the top and power from the generator would arc between them producing a blinding light to show the film . A piece of shaded glass would have been used in the hole on the side so that the projectionist could tell how far down the rods had burned in order to move them closer together and maintain the brightness . Source : I ran Carbon Arc Projectors in a small movie house back in the 1980s

1 I agree that Grave of the fireflies is a truly great movie , but it is not one that I will ever watch again . It is just so depressing .

1 woah .

1 Thanks ! Totally agree about reddit . I 'd lurked here on occasion , but never posted because I was intimidated . My experience is n't typical of course , but this community has been amazing for me . Helped make a dream come true , and also boosted my confidence as an artist and writer .

1 There was one `` Fuck '' It was said by an adult in the movie .

1 Not Hugo ?

1 The prequels main flaw was the writing ... The plot is the writing , the actors / characters are the writing .

1 Nephilim might be . They 're mentioned in Genesis . Fallen angels took human women and their children were like demigods . This happens in many old religions , like Hercules for example . > The Nephilim were on the earth in those days -- and also afterward -- when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them . They were the heroes of old , men of renown .

1 I could n't disagree more . It was a fantastic continuation of the canon . Definitely in the top tier of DBZ films .

1 Because it makes international box office .

1 I myself and completely and purely English speaking and I do enjoy foreign films quite a bit even though I do n't speak the language . But I do know where you are coming from . I 'm am sure it it less common for more casual movie watchers to not watch them as frequently as English films . As for the reddit dislikes them comment I am sure he was overexaggerating to prove a point . But again maybe these posts will have encouraged people to broaden their horizons and check out some foreign films that they may have not had the chance to experience before .

1 I did n't find the dialogue `` pseudo-intellectual '' at all . The mention of anything referring to hope , despair , or revenge does n't make the subject matter more or less intelligent . To me at least , the dialogue seemed expository to the point of spelling out every detail for the viewer , which usually shows a lack of subtlety that does n't leave much to the imagination . That 's to be expected from action blockbusters though , which are run of the mill and non superficial .

1 DAMM ! ! ! This is a great one cuz the more i thought about it totally lines up story wise kinda in the fact that each is about a man dealing with a dangerous split personality . Each of which rely heavily on destruction and anarchy ( Hulks not an anarchist per se but try getting him to follow traditional social protocol , he 'll prolly just smash ) . And Technically an alternate or deleted scene in Incredible Hulk [ deleted scene ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=xwrkR3PELJ8 ) has him trying to fix his double personality the same way Norton 's character dealt with Tyler Durden . Oh and DOI BOTH HAVE EDWARD FUCKIN NORTON as a dude with split personality . Great answer to a great question lol

1 Oh , it 's his eye ! At first glance , I had no idea what the hell I was looking at . Still excited to see this , though .

1 I thought the animation and art design was much better than anything that Pixar has ever done . However , I did n't think the story or dialogue was anything impressive .

1 Just the fact that they 're getting Will Arnett back to voice Batman tells me it 's the former rather than the latter . He 's probably the best Batman this side of Kevin Conroy . This likely wo n't be The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises in Lego form , it 's going to be pure ( intentional ) comedy .

1 > And staying true to the source does matter . Not always . One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest and The Shining barely stay true to their source materials and both are fantastic movies . > That 's why the Harry Potter movies , which strayed sucked Despite most installments getting high bouts of acclaim .

1 its actually a pretty good movie . Quite horrifying in certain parts but that movie definitly has some qualities that are hard to find in a bunch of movies . But be warned .

If you want to get weird , I would say that Anthony Hopkins did better in `` Silence of the Lambs '' than Anthony Hopkins did in `` Red Dragon '' , going on the fact that Red Dragon is chronologically first .

1 There was an interview with Peter Weller where he said he originally trained ( prepared ) for the role as Robocop by making very fluid , organic movements . Robocop was never * supposed * to have very slow , exaggerated movements . That only came about because the suit was too rigid to allow Peter Weller to move the way he intended to so he had to go completely to the other side of the spectrum . I think it was on the special features , but I 'm not sure . Here is a link to him recently talking about his role as Robocop : [ http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=66uduSIp-3k ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=66uduSIp-3k )

1 You mean like the climax of the series that has the characters finally break away from the mold of the rest of it , and a movie leading up to the final confrontation in the next part .

1 I 'm not sure if you 're aware of this , I know you meant a movie sequel , but Stephen King has actually written a sequel to The Shining called Doctor Sleep , and it is coming out in a few weeks . September 24 , to be exact . I 'm not sure if there will be a movie , but I 'm really excited to read it . Apparently it centers mostly around Danny after he grows up .

1 http : / qkme.me / 3p0n20

1 Yeah do not get me wrong , other than the characters and their motivations for carrying out certain actions i have little to complain about . The acting was good ( enough for a big release ) though only Fassbender had anything interesting to work with and excelled with it . The cinematography was as good as you would expect from such a big release . The overall plot was interesting though i would have liked far more focus on what the characters thought about things , when you dangle massive questions in peoples faces like recent movies and shows have done ( Lost , Cloverfield , Prometheus etc . ) then i would kill for some extended dialogue scenes in which the characters sit back and take stock of everything that has happened . The best scenes from Alien and Aliens are when they sit back and take stock of whats happening , in Alien we have Ash telling the crew about the creature that has attacked Kane , we see the autopsy after the event and we get a sense of his admiration for the creature without any heavy handed spelling it out . In Aliens we have the scenes where they set up their defensive lines in the old command post , they weld all the doors they put down the auto turrets , Bishop gets sent on his mission to go remote pilot a drop ship . Hicks teaches Ripley how to use the various weapons they have . Burke gets found out etc ... I was really annoyed that most of the crew who expressed an interest in what the creators where up to and why they did what they did turned out to be complete wankers when David had similar questions as to why Humans made robots like him . Specifically the husband , in the scene that David infects him he basically says his world has been shattered because the creators are not what he expected them to be and then dismisses David just as easily as he feels his creators have dismissed him .

1 Avengers is a fun movie but if your not a superhero fan you might not enjoy it as much . Took me twice to fully understand inception ( I was n't sober when I saw it the first time so that might just be me )

1 Have fun : [ The Asylum . ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / company / co0118327 / )

1 Well put !

1 According to IMDb it 's still 'Neighbors '

1 LEAVE CAGE ALONE !

1 * Y *

1 I tried to upvote you back to positive space . My main problem with the movie is how the whole thing plays out . Sinestro takes five guys with him to defeat the ultimate evil in the galaxy . If you 're gon na take on the ultimate evil , why would n't you take your entire fleet ? So it falls to the guy who 's had the ring on for , seriously , a day or so . Makes it about 20 minutes through training , quits , and goes home . So the guy who 's been Green Lantern for only a couple of days goes off and defeats the galaxy 's ultimate evil , when the top honchos in the GL corps could n't even do it . I understand that this is supposed to play out about how awesome Hal is , I get that . I just . . . could n't meet it there . That said , of all my gripes in the movie , Ryan Reynolds really did his best , and by no means do I lay my problems with the movie at his feet .

1 A world filled with zombies and bio-engineered monsters is suspension of disbelief , that was just stupid .

1 Maybe those were stone giants

1 He definitely should of been toned down , and it really did feel like a kid 's movie during the action scenes . But then they try to gritty it up and have the turtles throw in some `` asses '' , it just felt like very lazy writing to me .

1 H'BRUMBRUMBRUMBRUMBRUMBRUMBRUM ! !

1 HBOs next most illegally downloaded show ?

1 Yeah but ... it 's a different series . It 's building to the same place story-wise , but it 's a separate series . Charlton Heston is n't on that ship , some new character is . I 'm not sure what we 're arguing here .

1 But how will you know they 're cultured otherwise ? !

1 Maybe Ridley put that crack specifically there for a reason . I 'm not saying he did , but I do n't think you should rule that out .

1 Who , Attila the professor ? He was never giddy . Even when he was a schoolboy .

1 No ? It 's always had several alien races and things besides humans . Just because a black person is there does n't mean anything 's changed at all .

1 You 're right . We are now mortal enemies ...

1 I urge you to check it out ! Excellent horror - genuinely terrifying .

1 Even the Opera House is the right location !

1 He 's not an agent . He says `` I 'm CIA . '' He is an entire agency with every accent combined into one .

1 Rubbin is racin .

1 Cages intro to this film as the villain is great ! So etcentric and a baddy you love to hate . I wish the film lended itself for us to see more time of Cage being the villain .

1 #

1 Yeah all of his good movies are actually bad . We were fooled by the racist Hollywood elite . Jerks .

1 You forget sound editing and catering .

1 I laughed when the football player yells at all the cheerleaders `` I 'm going to fuck all of you '' and then they cut to the family tree and a whole bunch of branches pop up . That was about it .

1 > Young Allie : Why did n't you write me ? Why ? It was n't over for me , I waited for you for seven years . But now it 's too late . > Young Noah : I wrote you 365 letters . I wrote you everyday for a year . > Young Allie : You wrote me ? > Young Noah : Yes ... it was n't over , it still is n't over I get teary-eyed just thinking of this scene .

1 > `` The script was not completely prepared when filming began , since the filmmakers were more focused on the story and the action , so the dialogue was mostly ad-libbed throughout filming . '' [ Source ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / title / tt0371746 / trivia ) So I was a little off , but it was true that they did not have a script prepared .

1 Would a mass of people sinking underwater really get an R-rating ? Usually R-ratings are reserved for gore and bloodletting . There are a lot of PG-13 disaster movies showing massive amounts of people dying .

1 Organa knew about Luke , knew he had been taken to live with his Uncle on Tattooine and knew Kenobi was there watching over him .

1 Exactly ! They could even cite how Serenity got it right

1 But Black Dynamite , i sell drugs to the community !

1 Because the horror genre has failed to deliver any great films in a few years , I 'd love to see the Coen Brothers , David Lynch or Paul Thomas Anderson take one on .

1 Chris Doyle dp 'd one of these and he 's the best . The Clive Owen one I believe .

1 Well no shit . And to be honest , i dont mind that much because im a huge fan of movies and dont mind paying for it . But the only thing that bothers me is that we 'll get the `` full '' movie later . What we paid to see in theaters is not the finished product . Its kind of like DLC .

1 I pretty much understood it on first viewing and loved it , but it 's the kind of film I do n't really want to see again despite enjoying it .

1 These people do n't seem to be having much fun at their roller disco club .

1 This was the reason I went and saw the movie . Absolutely amazing use of the technology .

1 And was about a hero that was NEVER Marvel 's Superman . Hell , no Marvel character was as big as Superman with the public

1 It got so much better with the rock ! Fast five and six man !

1 A film that looked great and had great jokes would be nothing without a propulsive plot and characters that actually changed over the course of the film . If you have stagnant characters in a story that does n't move forward , then you do n't have a good movie .

1 It has more to do with the amount of food you 're actually eating . If you eat less , you lose weight . If you eat more , you gain weight . You are not a unique snowflake . The laws of physics and biology apply to you . Do n't give yourself an eating disorder or anything , just eat less if you want to lose weight . If you eat practically nothing , you will lose weight , but it might not best plan for long term health . If you eat like Christian Bale did in preparation for The Machinist , you will eventually look like Christian Bale did in The Machinist .

1 I blame Michael Cera .

1 That title do n't fuck around .

1 Yeah , it 's always worked out great for everyone else .

1 It 's not really a cameo if she appears in flashbacks for the rest of the movie .

1 Or , rather : * Steve McCroskey * : They could be miles off course ! * Rex Kramer * : That 's impossible . They 're on instruments !

1 I get what you 're saying but we should be supporting the creation of original ideas rather than just building on brands and ideas that already exist .

1 The backstage hallways and dressing rooms of the theatre were built and filmed on a soundstage exclusively for the film . The only scenes shot at the theatre were the stage , lobby , and exterior sequences .

1 Actually , I believe it was established in the first Thor movie that Asgardians are defenders of the Nine Realms , and that Thor as such is the defender of Midgard , Earth .

1 dae prequels SUCK ? ? ? ? ?

1 They just robbed sweet ol Mickey and are gon na hide at the enchanted castle . The driver knows the best spots .

1 Spot on . It 's like watching a Kreayshawn video waiting for Andy Samberg to pop out .

1 Its odd , I feel the exact opposite . I find nothing cute or nice about children singing in that choir boy style voice , I just find it irritating . I know thats weird , I 've just always felt that way .

1 You did n't read the article . > Technically , M. Night Shyamalan has two pretty solid movies : The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable . > The real success of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable was due to the surprise endings .

1 Captain Kirk does n't believe in the no-win scenario .

1 I 'm honored .

1 Feed me a stray cat .

1 O-B 1 Kenobi , cloned from the Jedi Benjamin Kenobi .

1 Tell that to the BBC .

1 I think the funniest bit is the look on his face when he does it , combined with the fact that he uses his fingers to dig himself deeper into the pit . It was also kind of a shock to see Homer do something like that . I think it 's one of the reasons the movie was so good , because they could finally get away with certain things that they could only really imply in the show .

1 I do n't know if it * changes * my worry . But it does provide a glimmer of hope .

1 PTA is the only director I would give this to .

1 Maybe they just want to make it clear it is a world changing event , not just Australia ?

1 Not sure if you were being serious , but Jared Leto is the lead singer of 30 seconds to mars . I believe Gyllenhaal is 100 % actor !

1 For all you lazy redditors /r/moviesinthemaking

1 pls respond

1 Right ? It seems to happen so much in this sub that people confuse what happens at the start of a film with a definitive biography of the character . It 's not a criticism of a film to point out that the protagonist does something dumb * at the start * , when the point of the plot , or some of the plot , is their learning from that and developing .

1 Who the fuck asked for a sequel ?

1 Shitty CGI ? ! Oh man ... I 've officially seen it all now !

1 I think Moon is just a completely underrated movie in general . Sam Rockwell should be in every movie .

1 Wiz Khalifa .

1 > I think that they are on a domain that is hosted outside our law . You just answered your own question .

1 I expected so much out of Birdman ( and it probably exceeded those expectations ) but knew nothing about Whiplash going into it . Holy shit .

1 It looks like Catwoman .

1 Because you touch yourself at night .

1 I like Oblivion as a fun little scifi story . I had a terrible sinking feeling during the first 40 minutes or so , which had all of this awful first-person videogame cgi , and really bothersome music . It looked and sounded like a highschooler directed the first part of the movie . After that it got much better though .

1 But one movie was about a comet and the other was about an asteroid . They 're totally different ! Anyway , both A Bug 's Life and Antz were quite good . Also Doctor Strangelove was great and Fail-Safe was pretty good . So sometimes it does work out well .

1 You think the leads eckhart and swank are unattractive ?

1 It 's depressing to think that we all essentially know the truth of what is in this film and are unable to change anything .

1 Are you a German by any chance ?

1 One of the best films of all time , absolutely perfect . [ Here is the full film on YouTube for anyone interested . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=GnLVMREVA6M )

1 Brando has always been a grade A diva though . Rod Steiger sat in for all the scenes even when he was not in shot so the two could perform together . When it came to the counter shots of Steiger , Brando simply walked off so that Steiger had to act against thin air . That was the film that made Brando so he was not a massive star at that point . Its also the man that read cue cards for Superman and maybe Mutiny on the Bounty too if memory serves .

1 Ignore the article , go straight to freak out mode

1 I do n't know anything about Karate . Was that a legal move ? Or was he penalized ?

1 Is that a pun ?

1 John Carpenter 's 1982 version I assume . Definitely recommend seeing it if you have n't already , one of the best horror movies of all time in my opinion .

1 Even still , the kids 10 or 11

1 I do n't know , I was shocked and disappointed that Superman , the man of pure and altruistic upstanding morals , would kill another man.. but I got over it . The character I saw on screen was n't the Superman I read in the comics or watched grow up in Smallville or constantly fight Batman in Justice League shows , this was a totally new Superman ... . and I really liked it . I watched this movie not knowing what to expect and being honestly , surprised . A lot of comic fans are mad that they changed the character so much but honestly I would have been bored if I had to watch another to the book Superman origin story . I have seen it done sooo many times . The fact that they paid homage to the old but moved in a new direction made this movie refreshing . I am excited for the sequel because I do n't know what to expect . I , Adrizzle93 , loved Man of Steel .

1 Supernatural , eh . Maybe he 's midichlorians .

1 'Alright , I 'm gon na take a HALT right now . Hungry Angry Lonely Tired and that 's you . ' From memory but something like that . Ed Norton is excellent in this . Especially coming off of a movie like Fight Club and it 's one of the few movies where I can stand Robin Williams character . I know that 's not a popular thing to say right now but I always liked serious Williams more than comedic and then I saw him as seriously demented and was sold . Great flick

1 The `` Holy rusted metal , Batman ! '' line always brings a smile to my face .

1 Him and Depp have known each other for years , their daughters go to school together and have been friends since they were little .

1 3rd post you 've 'seended ' this week ... .

1 Uhh , Jackie Chan said that ... in the article . Did you even read it ?

1 empire strikes back is widely considered to be the best of the star wars movies

1 > Warriors come out to playeeyay

1 Happy to help . Neat poster !

1 All the ones I never noticed .

1 i agree with iluvbreakfast , it had its moments , but eventually it become some quasi-love film with two characters with no chemistry . But mostly they did not live up to that incredible opening scene witch i think was one of the best openings in a long time .

1 That would be too easy for them to win . There should be 13 Norse warriors sent to fight Jason .

1 Oh man . I managed to suspend my disbelief until the `` ate his arm '' part . Hee-fucking-larious . I 'd pay money to see that .

1 Hat .

1 `` SUCK MY COCK I 'LL MURDER YOUR FAMILY '' definitely will ferrell at his best

1 The other thing is that even if it 's amazing , the story will be extraordinarily similar to at least the first half of # 1 .

1 god , every time . Pixar released this then Up and then Toy Story 3 all in a row . They really wanted to make kids cry .

1 I really enjoyed Win Win . The kid in it was apparently a state champion wrestler , but had to stop competing because he broke a vertebra . Turns out he 's a pretty good actor too !

1 The part where the Mac with a custom OS `` uploaded a virus '' to a literal alien computer over some cord we 've apparently standardized with them and it just happened to find the one system that was n't protected at all and win ? That part ? Yeah . I almost walked . I chose to laugh out of my chair instead .

1 Lmao you got ta be kidding .

1 Your friend has blond hair . Congratulations .

1 Friday the 13th

1 I thought it worked rather well .

1 There is nothing anti-war about the film . What you claim is anti-war is giving any realistic view of the war . In fact the movie was pro-war - it celebrates the soldier 's daring and of course he lives in the end . You could make a serious anti-war movie based on the Iraq war , one that has a lot more impact than the Hurt Locker . For comparison 's sake , look at Vietnam movies . Apocalypse Now , Platoon , Deer Hunter , etc . all had a much clearer anti-war message .

1 Doubtful , the aliens vs predator thing was made up by comic writers more than 10 years after the first movie . Most of the people behind both franchises really do n't like it . None of the alien movies acknowledge the existence of the predator . Nor does the first predator movie . The second predator movie only has an Alien skull in the trophy room because Stan Winston insisted on it and put the skull there against the explicit wishes of the director and the studio because he was a fan of the comics . The aliens vs predator movies were eventually made because the owners of the intellectual property figured they could make some money of the fans . Both avp movies and the second predator movie are considered to be so bad that the writer and director for Predators ( the third predator movie ) explicitly stated to their production crew that the avp movies * never happened * as far as Predators was concerned . ( even though Predators also has an alien skull in the trophy camp ) In short , Alien vs Predator is sort of a separate franchise to please fans of the monsters . For all intends and purposes neither the Alien or the Predator franchise acknowledges the existence of the other creature in their universe . Mostly because the writing for Aliens vs Predator is consistently terrible and would have a very bad effect on both universes . And even in the AvP universe the alien is n't an especially effective bioweapon against predators . Predators love the aliens and go out of their way to find them and fight them . There 's several several story arcs where predators go to great lengths to capture queens in order to intentionally create alien infestations so they have a fun new hunting ground . It 's sort of messy but the most accurate way of looking at things is to say that Alien , Predator and Aliens vs Predator are three separate franchises with zero overlap . The special effects guys are usually just fond of hiding an alien skull in predator movies as an easter egg . The guys working on alien movies on the other hand are usually very keen on pretending the whole predator franchise does n't exist .

1 Uh ... it 's based on a series of books where those characters did live , because they are relevant in following books . And the love story may not be as sappy twilight as you think . ( If they keep following the books . ) Katniss is , even in the movie , explicitly instructed to * play up * the romance angle because that it what will entice supporters who will contribute supplies . I never got the sense watching the movie that Katniss had more than vague affection for the boy at best . The storyline of the books is REALLY not about Katniss 's search for her undying love .

1 We 're already halfway there

1 Joan Jett thought so too . She was a technical consultant for the film , and when they sent her an audio of the cast 's vocal performance for her input , she thought they sent one of her originals by mistake .

1 With Star Wars I was discussing Williams in general , but I see now how that did n't get through in the way I said it . Whoops lol

1 Your very comment * does * make you `` that guy '' who is pretentious . Yes , shallow * and * pedantic .

1 > ..never any character development in a Tarantino film Um ... Jackie Brown .

1 Getting inspiration from somewhere is a completely different concept than remaking a movie . They 're not even related .

1 You 're fucking wrong dude ... One of the worst movies I have ever seen .

1 You could just call it something it 's actually called , though . I mean , you have 3 different options .

1 you fucking stupid bastard !

1 I know ! What the fuck !

1 I assume he means $ 15 each for two 3d tickets , which is high but not uncommon .

1 Spawn 's watchably bad . No Electra on the list makes it invalid .

1 : ?

1 Actually , there 's a reason for that ... http : / m.youtube.com / watch ? v=1rhqAcCoSBQ

1 Heist movies are awesome .

1 Because it is likely that 99 % of people who frequent /r/movies have no idea how to write a screenplay ?

1 Marvel is a brand now , like Pixar , their movies perform on the strength of their logo . People all over the world will see it just based on that . Look at how well Thor did , and that did n't look anywhere near as good as this .

1 Is n't everyone a cousin in the south ?

1 He certainly * looks * really old without makeup .

1 Yep . You have to check it out ! Also , there is a doc called Best Worst Movie . Check it out on Netflix .

1 Yes that 's also true

1 Zodiac feels like Fincher 's quiet masterpiece . While Fight Club had its huge cultural impact and The Social Network was his critical / award winning darling , and both Gone Girl and TGWTDT based off modern bestsellers , Zodiac has little to claim for itself ( apart from its cast who were n't all that famous at the time ) . But to me , it is his best executed and most understated film .

1 `` Arrows cost money . Use up the Irish . The dead cost nothing . ''

1 Careful , I read somewhere they amputate that shit after a few days ...

1 They 're referring Tarantino 's ... uh exuberant mannerisms . And sniffles .

1 Actually , Aragorn Origin films incoming , a trilogy with those three titles .

1 OR DO YOU ?

1 i do n't care as long as Justin Bieber wins a Tony award for his photojournalism

1 I have a feeling that this summer there will be a lot of people on that trail that have no idea what they are doing .

1 Yeah , Brad Pitt 'll do that .

1 `` Sam just stepped on a shard of glass and slashed up his foot . ''

1 He was saying it all the time , for weeks . Drove everybody crazy .

1 Christmas Vacation . I look forward to the shitter being full every damn year .

1 You are wrong .

1 * `` People think you can gain 30 lbs of muscle in less than a year with a good routine and diet ... because they have never worked out for any consistent amount of time '' *

1 I bounce , you shoot ( lightning bolts )

1 If you want to see an entertaining film with some light existentialism ( read : accessible for most audiences ) and some of the best damn special effects you 'll ever see , than yeah , go see it . I never saw what the big deal is with 3D .

1 Also they made him incredibly stupid science-wise , whereas his intelligence is one of his defining characteristics in virtually every other adaptation .

1 Excellent find ! You should cross-post it to someplace where it 'd actually be appreciated .

1 Love that movie ! Encapsulates the entire eighties in 106 minutes .

1 Pirates of Silicon Valley . Easily one of the best ( and for the most part accurate ) depictions of the Bill Gates vs Steve Jobs era .

1 One of my favorite movies ever , showing us that sometimes the only thing keeping us down is our own stupid head .

1 reinforcing stereotypes can often be interpreted as racism .

1 and what 's the deal with airplane food

1 Not to mention there was a hive of Mist Wasps like , 20 feet behind him . Who knows what else their might be just up ahead ?

1 This has always been my impression too , the crazy man calling his son for help so he can ax his head off .

1 god damn it frank show some class for christ 's sake .

1 God , the music sounded amazing in IMAX . [ The bass was almost too much sometimes . ] ( https : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=SA8bdV8CJNQ # t=119 )

1 It 's sarcasm , no hard feelings , not easy to get on the internet . I was just pointing out that he has made a lot of kids movies , which a lot of people do n't know about Robert Rodriguez . He 's more known as the Grindhouse / Quentin Terrentino Friend .

1 he was nominated

1 Yes ! This movie ... . just ... wow .

1 [ Curtis Armstrong ] ( http : / www.imdb.com / name / nm0035664 / )

1 And shortly after , when he finally tries to talk to the mannequin and loses it . I did see it alone , so maybe that had an extra effect on me ...

1 seven samurai , the magnificent seven , but I repeat myself : )

1 New girl played by hailee steinfeld

1 Vincent Cassel is always fantastic . Also banging Monica Bellucci .

1 I think it 's rice . At the end when they get remarried everyones tossing rice as they walk out of the chapel . Or , ya know , it could just be cocaine . He is Mr Papageorgio after all .

1 Wow , really ? That 's insane ! I totally banged a sex with this girl during Avengers . She goes to school in a different state ... . you would n't know her .

1 The final episode of CSI should just be a guy in a lab coat sitting , bored , in front of a beige machine that 's slowly whirring away . Checking his phone , picking his nails , dozing off . For a full hour . At the end of the episode the machine stops whirring . The guy looks up . * Pause . * The whirring resumes . * Fade to black ... . *

1 I was enraptured , watching him stir . My eyes widened in horror as it looked like he was about to let the tag fall into the glass - a terrible crime . Then I saw his eyes . * His eyes * , glaring at me , as if to say , `` You dare judge my tea-stirring ? You * dare * ! ?

1 Have n't watched a full length movie trailer in years because of this . They give away the entire damn movie . Go watch a trailer pre 2000 and come back ( initial trailer not tv spot after 4th week out ) They just do n't seem to give away as much of the movie as they do now . Case in point check out the trailer for [ Face Off ] ( http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=Vlg-VRc6TbY ) ( I choose an awesome movie from the 90 's at random ) Most of the damn 2 minute long is using all clips from the first 10 minutes of the film like it should be . Also all the action clips intertwined are very quick and vague . Anyhow just my two cents as this has been a constant gripe with me for years now lol

1 Gefilte Fish .

1 He 's one of those rare people that I classify as 'so talented that nobody knows what the hell to do with them . '

1 Why are you eating my sesame cake ? ! ?

1 Man , I like him even more now as Bones .

1 Or golden age Spain !

1 This guy .

1 Money *

1 He can take Channing Tatum with him too .

1 I will only see this movie if Sam Jones is in it , and immediately after seeing the original for the first time .

1 They are n't even black and white .

1 To be perfectly fair , Grace Kelly sucked about as hard . Hate to say it because she 's such an icon , but her acting was atrocious .

1 I do n't see why the third movie should live up to anything else than the two previous ones

1 > they still look very cg They are not supposed to come off as photorealistic ...

1 This movie is so goddamn funny . Some jokes are so subtle I did n't even notice them until after watching it 3 or 4 times . I just watched this earlier today and died laughing at the end when Steve Coogan is stalling and he says `` Wait , wait but COMPUTERS ! What if , one day , they are in charge ... ? ''

1 I feel similar . It was a gutsy move on Kaufman 's part to do what he did , and to make her into this character , and it puts me at ease a little bit to know that the author was able to appreciate the film for what it became .

1 All youtube comments are retarded .

1 I remeber going to see Star Wars for the first time at a drive in near my house . That movie changed my life . But it was a double feature with Jason and the Argonauts that set me on the path of getting into fantasy geek stuff . Those 2 movies set the stage for my nerdness for the rest of my life .

1 He has a section devoted to him in the 25th anniversary SNL book . > There have been many bad hosts on Saturday Night Live , but perhaps the worst of all time is Steven Seagal ; in fact , Seagal made the list of the Top Ten Dubious SNL Hosts . According to the book , Live From New York by Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller , back in 1991 when Seagal hosted the show , cast member David Spade said it was the first time he heard talk about replacing the host and doing a cast show . > Julia Sweeney said : ? When we pitched our ideas for Seagal at our Monday meeting , he gave us some of his own sketch ideas . And some of his sketch ideas were so heinous , but so hilariously awful , it was like we were on Candid Camera . > ? He had this idea that he ? s a therapist and he wanted Victoria Jackson to be his patient who ? s just been raped . And the therapist says , ? You ? re going to have to come to me twice a week for like three years , ? because , he said , ? that ? s how therapists freaking are . They ? re just trying to get your money. ? And then he says that the psychiatrist tries to have sex with her. ? > Tim Meadows said : ? The biggest problem with Steven Seagal was that he would complain about jokes that he didn ? t get , so it was like ? you can ? t explain something to somebody in German if they don ? t speak German . He just wasn ? t funny and he was very critical of the cast and the writing staff . He didn ? t realize that you can ? t tell somebody they ? re stupid on Wednesday and expect them to continue writing for you on Saturday . ?

1 It 's not porn ? it 's HBO

1 Adding to that , watch the amount of gesturing that Hugo uses in V as compared to the Matrix or LotR . In V Hugo 's every movement is bigger than it would have to be if we could see his face . There is an entirely different art and technique to acting in a mask that has been in use for thousands of years . Mask work and American naturalism emphasize completely different things in performance .

1 Totally agree . I liked Tarantino 's other movies but Pulp Fiction really disappointed me . Maybe watching it after hearing it 's `` one of the best films of all time '' left my expectations too high , I do n't know

1 Same here . When the lights in the dark water blended so well with the star strewn sky and the boat appeared to be flying ? Yeah , that was the best .

1 This is actually my favorite Shakespearean play . Ca n't wait !

1 I 'm probably a soul-less asshole but I prefer the Cohen version ... People are always trying to tell me the Buckley version has more emotion . I do n't get it . Cohen wrote it , and gives it the rough kind of melancholy feel it needs .

1 Yes . I 'm not gon na bother trying to convince you , I 'm just going to tell you to go watch it as soon as possible .

1 Completely agree . I 'd love to recreate the maroon dress , it 's been a favorite since I was a child . I think it would be perfect as a wedding dress in an off white silk with white lace .

1 I guess ... duh ? Did anyone think they were running really close margins selling popcorn at 9 dollars a bucket ? The theaters get to keep barely any of the ticket prices for the first few weeks , so they make money on the concessions . Why is this news ?

1 It did ! My eyes were hurting cause of the 3d trailers but once the movie started i did n't feel a thing !

1 Then you 're going to love it here .

1 No one but it accounts , partially , for it being less successful .

1 I do n't get it . Whats wrong with that statement ?

1 The magic of Reddit , thanks bruh .

1 TBWP was really good to see it in theatres . The marketing back then was done really well for it also . I think it was the first dvd i ever bought when it came out , randomly !

1 Do n't forget that actively serving military forgoes the right to vote . The military literally has no say whatsoever in the running of the government . Going career military is effectively forgoing your right to ever vote for most of your life .

1 Not the best solution but I 'll throw this out there because it was n't really your doing and all these discs will be sent back to the manufacturer / distributor anyway : Buy another set ( or just those two movies if they 're the only ones that are screwed up ) and replace the movie discs with your special feature discs . Then return the Blu-Rays with your new receipt and claim this was the screwed up transaction . You may get store credit since they 're open but if they give you unopened ones , sell them on eBay . Again , not the best solution but better than being out the movies completely .

1 Mother , or mum , perhaps . But 'mom ' , eh ... No .

1 I know .

1 Hi-tek Ninja , zef so fre $

1 your right . How could I forget . She was badd .

1 Ugh ... . you had * one * job to do .

1 I do n't think obscure means what you think it means

1 Logan Lerman REALLY impressed me in Perks .

1 2005 was the most recent - Crash won best Picture , Ang Lee won best director for Brokeback Mountain .

1 There is an /r/moviescirclejerk where talking about this is apparently a running joke .

1 I love it , and would not consider it a comedy at all . I think it suffers from people not being able to think of enough genres to label things as : p I 'd call it a Romantic Adventure film ?

1 I do n't know ... the context , * to me * , says its just a bombastic compliment . The paragraph after the picture has Feige saying how its the biggest movie climax they 've done yet , so that seems to say that Joss was just saying , `` That 's so huge and awesome , how could I top that ! '' Also , just in context , why would Feige try to promote * Iron Man 3 * by disclosing some secret discord between Joss and Shane Black , and how Whedon 's planned * Avengers 2 * might be ruined ? That does n't make any sense . More likely , especially with the second section about it being their biggest climax yet , it was him just saying `` Even Whedon was blown away ! He thinks its so epic he made a jokey comment about not being able to follow it ! '' I do n't know Joss personally , but as a huge fan of his work that * is * the sort of humor and geeky compliment he would give . And again : if its a sign of a real problem , why would Feige tell it to the press as part of promotion ? That would be a strange marketing strategy . `` Go see Iron Man 3 ! Its ending fucks up our continuity , says the director of the Avengers ! ''

1 http : / www.youtube.com / watch ? v=jUgOKWynhnA shows some of the best CGI scenes from Blade Runner

1 caant unfortunately because i could lose my job : /

1 American Sniper is a better character study , but Lone Survivor is more visceral and intense . Both are great and worth seeing .

1 Ya , you got time to duck ?

1 I love the Ferrell-McKay flicks , but I would like to see Will do more stuff like the Harold Crick role . I wish Hal Ashby were still alive -- he 'd be perfect for him . I guess Ferrrell did work with Woody Allen and that tanked . Maybe he can work with Coens or something . Would love to see him explore his range in between these McKay flicks , which again I enjoy the shit out of .

1 He just opened a Twitter account today : [ @ verhoevenstweet ] ( http : / twitter.com / VerhoevensTweet ) The first tweet is in Dutch and translates at as * My first tweet , who 'll show me around ? *

1 `` Tom Cruise did n't know he was in that vampire film until two years later . '' I love Bowfinger .

1 Well , I heard he got some advice from Woody . `` Due to serious popular demand , will you be trying to resurrect Firefly in the future ? Fans would love to see it back '' * The great thing about firefly ? It gave me this great idea for this scene in The Avengers ... * [ 4 paragraphs about Avengers ] `` Mr Whedon ... ..Firefly ? '' * Ah yes , The Avengers * `` Firefly . '' * Avengers ? *

1 true , so here 's an upvote .

1 george lucas struck gold . plain and simple . I 'm almost positive he had no idea Star Wars would do so well .

1 Depends on how the midterm elections turn out lol

1 I actually thought the last part of that line was terrifying , but that was more in the delivery of it

1 I absolutely * hated * The Big Lebowski the first few times I saw it , but I had friends who insisted that it was a great movie . Around the third time I saw it , something clicked . Now it 's one of my favorite movies . The problem is that there 's no real introduction to the characters . It 's kind of like watching an episode of a TV show half-way through the third season . A lot of the humor is about how the characters interact with each other and the outside world . Once you know the characters , it 's pretty funny and there is quite a bit of nuance . Before then , the characters are all over-the-top and the humor seems very blatant . At least that 's how it was for me . If you just do n't like the actors , then there might not be much hope for you .

1 What ? How is this like onion news ?

1 I just finished downloading the 6GB HD version about two minutes ago , literally .

1 The movie does have an 80s thing going on .

1 Sorry I thought it 'd more clear on the page , open it up with the icon at the bottom bar of the browser , open the box with `` select action '' around the top left and click `` add '' , you 'll see 3 text boxs to the left of it , in `` header name '' type X-forwarded-for ( it should come up as an option as soon as you type x ) In the `` header value '' box type : 12.13.14.15 ( this is an example that works , you can other values online too ) Then simply press the enable button on the left and websites will see you as an American .

1 It 's not great to contribute something that 's hurting anyone 's culture , but if its your culture , you know what they 've been through better than anyone so you ca n't even claim ignorance .

1 I respect him for the fact that he could have easily taken a more commercial route and been a People Magazine cover boy , but obviously wanted to go in a different direction .

1 I read it the same way and thought to myself , `` I see this going badly . '' But it did n't , and I had a sad .

1 Can confirm . For optimal results add weed .

1 I think a sequel would be better , since part of Mr. and Mrs . Incredible 's life as super-heros were shown in the first 30 ( ? ) minutes of movie . But really , anything would do , I want to see the Incredibles at it again .

1 it was mostly shot in nashville , and i drive by the black midget in the film pretty often . his name is brian and he hangs out at a corner liquor store selling drugs .

1 Maybe they were told not to make eye contact so Trevor would n't get distracted .

1 Linklater films a lot faster than that . I was reading it was about a week a year . 12 weeks total is about right for a feature film .

1 I have a friend named Jonny that I play poker with every week , and every week I get to say `` Why , Jonny , if I did n't think we were friends ... I just do n't think I could bear it . ''

1 I liked that movie .

1 IIRC it took place in the afterlife and Maximus fought Zeus or something like that and was reincarnated and fought in WWI or WW2 , it was just bad .

1 both movies are amazing . Blue Ruin is smart storytelling with everything unfolding organically with no forced exposition ( AHEM Inception ) then Frank was just an awesome character study . It reminded me of Submarine and Almost Famous , both of which i love , so naturally i loved Frank , not to mention Fassbender being awesome and the ending song scene was incredible .

1 There 's nothing fishy about it . What 's interesting about New Coke is that Coke did everything right in testing the product before launch . They literally carried out hundreds of thousands of trials and in almost all cases , people preferred the taste of New Coke to the original . Different demographics and regions were tested . So what went wrong then ? Basically , in the smaller 'sample ' amounts , the sweeter taste is more preferable and so people chose it . But a whole can / bottle of it ? Its just too sweet . And that 's what happened .

1 I think the best directed scene in Godzilla was the Halo jump scene . When the red flares fall through the clouds , makes for a wonderful cinematic moment .

1 I thought the CGI in that scene was quite mediocre , but it is amazing in concept . Not because it breaks new ground or anything , but because for once they gave the game 's fans something to be hyped about . There was a little bit of DOOM in the DOOM movie . How about that , huh ? Pretty great .

1 Which made sense

1 When Cartoon Network would play it 24 hours a day . That 's all I would watch .

1 OP mentioned the second movie ( which I have n't seen by the way , but the plot synopsis on wikipedia did n't mention birth control , although it did talk about estrogen supplements to combat symptoms of menopause ) , so I do n't know if the average 1950 's viewer would connect those two since it is a lot less material to examine than the show . And the characters seem to enjoy the excess consumption and at the end of the film do n't seem to suffer any ill effects from it , so I do n't know why an audience would see efficiency and globalization as a bad thing . But I 'd be happy to consider a counterargument if you 're still up for it .

1 I only just found out from you it was CGI .

1 That mans dream scares me .

1 I 'm really pumped . It 's written and directed by Christopher Macquarie The Usual Suspects & Jack Reacher . Whether you liked Jack Reacher or not , it had excellent action scenes . And this one has Tom Cruise actually strapping himself to a jet in flight !

1 You mean `` shexh '' ?
