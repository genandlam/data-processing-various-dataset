speaker4: vince...
speaker3: how did i get so lucky? what is it now, five years we've been together? who do i thank?
speaker4: today was the deadline, vince. vince sits on the bed. he takes christy's hand, and kisses it.
speaker3: i want us to be together. like people. honest, decent people. in the eyes of babe, today... i went to confession.
speaker4: you did what?
speaker3: for the first time in i don't know how long. i wanted everything done right. open and above board. i told father antonelli i was in love. i told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
speaker4: you said that? and what did he say? did he say you could leave her? did he say we'd be happy?
speaker4: what?
speaker3: you want me to go against a priest? get excommunicated? you think i'm nuts?
speaker4: you bastard!

speaker2: but what about us?
speaker3: you taught us the act. the songs, all the moves.
speaker1: and where did it get me? i'm stuck in this rathole! you're holding me back, just like vince! i should be headlining!
speaker1: what do you want? this is a private area! get lost!
speaker4: you ain't got nothin' i ain't seen.
speaker1: then stop trying to memorize it. hit the road.

speaker3: michelle and tina can't restrain themselves: they open the box. inside is a rather gaudy fur coat. michelle and tina are impressed.

speaker1: it's a bribe. five years of my life!
speaker2: so you earned it!
speaker3: vince owns the casino! cash in
speaker1: i should throw this in his facet
speaker1: oh, what is going on here? why me? whose dog did i kill?
speaker2: hi, lieutenant.
speaker3: hello, eddie.
speaker5: from vince? what a guy. doo-lang, doo- lang.
speaker1: at least he's not a cop. at least he can afford a decent gift.
speaker5: i used to buy.you,..stuff. on your birthday . when we were seeing each other.
speaker1: yeah, like what? quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? lottery tickets? a travel iron?
speaker5: so i don't shop.
speaker1: 'cause you're always out, arresting people. making trouble. i don't know why i went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! i couldn't hold my head up, i used to tell people you were a security guard!
speaker5: oh, yeah? well, how do you think i felt? you were singing in bowling alleys back then. i told people you were a hooker!
speaker2: calm down, you two. it's always like this.

speaker5: a what? when are you qonna wake up?
speaker1: when are you gonna get off my case? have you got a search warrant? what do you want -- cheap thrills?

speaker5: i'm going. my regards to vince, and the mrs.
speaker5: ladies.
speaker1: that's it! i'm not taking it from him, and i'm not taking it from vince! from now on, it's all about me! and if i can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with it -- it's gone. like sister immaculata used to say, "life is short, and then you fry." so long, girls -- see you in church! christy grabs the mink and heads out the door.

speaker1: ernie schmidt. how long you been with us, ernie schmidt? 
speaker2: three years, mr. larocca. one behind the bar, two as croupier.

speaker1: christy. is there a problem? with the coat?
speaker2: no... it's fine.
speaker1: yes?
speaker2: thanks. a lot.
speaker1: is that why you came up here, christy? to thank me?
speaker2: sure.
speaker1: and to say you're sorry. about this afternoon. and the things you said. forgotten. completely. do you understand? forgotten.
speaker2: right. yeah. forgotten. page 13.

speaker1: christy? he only wants to talk to you! page 14. 
speaker2: christy?
speaker1: christy?
speaker1: come on, christy! there's no place to go!

speaker1: right between the eyes! down and out! the guy was gone! i... i couldn't believe it! 
speaker2: you couldn't believe it? vince the prince?
speaker1: i never said he was an altar boy, okay? but he sent his goons after me! they tried to kill me! i'm not kidding!
speaker3: tough break. whoa.
speaker2: what did you expect? vince is as dirty as they come. we've been finding bodies around here for years.
speaker1: i don't know anything about bodies! i mean, he didn't bring it home. he was good to me... sometimes. he was sweet. he took care of me. who am i supposed to go out with? he owns a casino. he let me sing.
speaker2: he didn't do you a favor.
speaker1: screw you!
speaker4: come on, she'll sing great. when she sings for us.
speaker1: sing -- like testify? are you nuts? i just want you to protect me! you're cops!
speaker4: busy cops. we don't have time to be bodyguards for anyone who comes in here with some cockamamie story. mink coats and laundry chutes.
speaker3: unless, of course, you're willing to testify.
speaker1: what is this, some squeeze play? can't you just protect me without any strings?
speaker2: we could put you into our witness protection program.
speaker4: a hiding place.
speaker3: a new identity.
speaker2: but you'd have to agree to testify. the whole nine yards.
speaker1: and if i don't?
speaker2: then-you run.
speaker4: you wait.
speaker3: you listen for the footsteps.
speaker2: then one day they find you.
speaker4: they open a window.
speaker3: it's ten flights up.
speaker4: ten flights down.
speaker1: ten flights?
speaker2: you'd lose. you'd die. all over the sidewalk. and into the street.
speaker1: all right! i get the picture! i'll do it! i'll testify!
speaker2: get a stenographer. page 18.
speaker1: okay, here's what i want. i know about this stuff. a five-star hotel. with room service.
speaker2: maybe hawaii.
speaker3: diamond head.
speaker1: yeah. and i'll need a new look. like a disguise.
speaker2: maybe armani.
speaker3: no -- calvin klein.
speaker1: for sportswear. and a limo. and my hair -- up?
speaker3: it could work.
speaker2: what do you think this is -- wheel of fortune? let me spell it out for you. you have to hide like you don't even exist. you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
speaker1: okay -- no limo.
speaker2: no nothing.
speaker1: what're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
speaker2: i'm gonna put you in the last place on earth that vince would ever look for you.

speaker1: i hate you. i totally hate you. 
speaker2: safest place in the world. you think vince would look for you here?
speaker1: nuns, eddie. there are nuns here. everywhere. it's crawling with 'em.
speaker2: it's a convent. all you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
speaker1: with nuns? with rulers? no way. i'm gonna go back, work things out with vince.
speaker2: vince has put out a contract on you. a hundred grand. you've seen him in action.
speaker1: but... but vince loves me. how could he... i mean, five years...
speaker2: and one bullet. that's all it's gonna take.
speaker1: but vince has contacts all over the place! this is san francisco! they'll be looking for me!
speaker2: everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent. nobody knows you're here but me. we're trying to get a quick court date. a month, maybe two, tops. i'll spring you as soon as i can.
speaker1: i can't stay here! i'll crack up! eddie, what am i gonna do?
speaker2: pray.

speaker1: absolutely not. i am very sorry, but no. 
speaker2: we can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture. page 21.
speaker1: but she's been exposed to the underside of life. she is the underside of life.
speaker2: and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
speaker1: we're a small convent, bishop. surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
speaker2: your small convent is in danger of closing, reverend mother. the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
speaker1: but, bishop...
speaker2: st. katherine's is a benedictine order. you have taken a vow of hospitality. to all in need.
speaker1: i lied.
speaker2: i know.
speaker2: welcome, lieutenant. everything is in order.
speaker3: aces. bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, down at the corner?
speaker4: hey, you're not leaving me alone...
speaker2: you're never alone in this house, my child. eddie touches her gently on the arm.
speaker3: one month, two tops. behave yourself.
speaker1: bishop...
speaker2: lieutenant?

speaker1: a convent? they put me in a convent? what's the problem? wasn't there any more room in hell? 
speaker2: what is your full name? your christian name?
speaker1: mother theresa. gandhi. don't you understand? this is all a mistake. i'm the good guy. i'm the witness. and i'm being punished!
speaker2: your name?
speaker1: christy. christy van cartier.
speaker2: enough joking.
speaker1: that's my real name! currently i'm a singer. sort of.
speaker2: very well.
speaker1: oh my this isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening. it's a nightmare, i'm back at st. anne's!
speaker2: st. anne's?
speaker1: parochial school. akron. st. android's.
speaker2: you were unhappy?
speaker1: i was expelled! when i was fifteen?
speaker2: the reason?
speaker1: beats me! what do you think? smoking! heavy petting, without a chaperone. heavy petting, with the chaperone. and wearing a black bra, under my uniform. the demon bra.
speaker2: i see.
speaker1: you see? you see? i have to get out of here i have to make a phone call. don't you get it? i'm in a convent! you're a nun!
speaker2: sit down.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: sit.
speaker2: miss van cartier.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: your cigarette -- out. christy inspects her cigarette.
speaker2: it has come to pass.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i joined this convent some thirty years ago. at that time, the world knew some measure of peace. and hope. our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise. and, as the years have passed, i have watched that promise destroyed. drugs. gangs. spandex. and. so i have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
speaker1: are you talking about me?
speaker2: and all those like you.
speaker1: you mean black people?
speaker2: absolutely not. i mean the wicked. the heedless. and their las vegas concubines.
speaker1: what's a concubine?
speaker2: check your driver's license.
speaker1: fine. got it. look, the way i see it, i'm stuck here, right? i mean, i'm here or i'm target practice. so here's the deal -- i don't bug you, you don't bug me. i'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low. so just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb. capisce?
speaker2: of course. but it's almost lunch.
speaker1: cool. is there a menu? or buffet?
speaker2: before we do, you might like to freshen up. and you'll certainly want to change
speaker1: deal.

speaker1: how about a robe? one of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket. "guest of st. katherine's" 
speaker2: would you like that?
speaker1: you should hand-wash that blouse, and send somebody out for some things. i look good in reds, purples, hot pink -- and shoes. five-inch heels. fuck-me pumps. oh, man -- sorry. 'scuse my mouth.
speaker2: excused. open the cabinet to your left. you will find appropriate attire.
speaker1: can do.

speaker1: no! no! i can't do this! 
speaker2: normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all. while you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. only i shall know who, and what, you truly are. you will not disrupt the convent. you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk. you will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
speaker1: but look at rites look at this! i'm a nun! i'm invisible! i'm a penguin!
speaker2: as of now, and until you leave, you are sister mary clarence.
speaker1: mary clarence? like a guy? like a guy?

speaker1: the mary is in deference to the holy mother, the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola. there are three vows that every nun must accept. the vow of poverty... 
speaker2: no problem.
speaker1: the vow of obedience.
speaker2: like to who?
speaker1: and the vow of chastity.
speaker2: i'm outta here.

speaker1: good afternoon, sisters. i apologize for my tardiness. i would like you to welcome a new member of our order, sister mary clarence. 
speaker1: mary clarence comes to us from a somewhat more progressive convent. she is eager for a more disciplined life, and will make every effort to conform to our ways.
speaker1: yes, mary patrick?
speaker2: reverend mother, on behalf of the sisters, i'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine's.
speaker2: as part of our welcome, i've had a little thought, just for fun. could we have our new friend offer today's blessing?
speaker1: very well. mary clarence, rise please.
speaker3: a blessing? like, for lunch?
speaker3: for what we are about to receive...
speaker3: may the lord... prepare us and... watch us and... walk through the valley and be our shepherd and... to the republic for which it stands... bless us every one, hallowed be thy name. hallelujah. ave maria. boyardee. amen.
speaker1: sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence.
speaker3: a what?
speaker1: surely you are familiar with this practice, mary clarence. only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
speaker3: silence? no talking? all day?
speaker1: until sundown.
speaker3: oh my
speaker1: and mary clarence?
speaker1: as a new member of our order, i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
speaker3: a what?
speaker1: a fast. to remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
speaker3: no food?
speaker1: no food. not until sundown.

speaker1: they grilled me for six hours in there. and my hotshot lawyer -- where the were you? 
speaker2: it takes time, vince. slow and steady. we've been through this before.
speaker3: so long, vince. see you soon. page 30.
speaker1: he's so cocky. this is different.
speaker4: it's a bluff, vince.
speaker1: you know so much. they've got christy, and we've got to find her. get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge. fax it to every contact we got.
speaker2: i can't hear this. i'm an attorney, vince, and you're just an honest casino owner. object of a witch hunt. innocent victim.
speaker1: keep the message vague, but let 'em know. the price has gone up. christy van cartier -- a quarter of a million. dead or nearby.

speaker1: is this all the food i get? 
speaker2: yes. until breakfast.
speaker1: that's tomorrow! don't you have any snacks? machines?
speaker2: this shall be your cell, mary clarence.
speaker1: my what?
speaker2: your cell. your room.

speaker1: you were right the first time. is this like, solitary? the cooler? where's the furniture? 
speaker2: our lives are simple. we have little need for material possessions.
speaker1: right, sure thing. but what about, like, appliances? like a little color portable? boom box?
speaker2: useless distractions.
speaker1: it's like the stone age. the room time forgot. what about a phone?
speaker2: and whom would you call?
speaker1: oh, i don't know... satan?
speaker2: your cell is more than adequate.
speaker1: right. so what do we do now? ping- pong? row over to the monastery?
speaker2: it is nine p.m. pleasant dreams.
speaker1: wait. no. you're kidding. lights out? at nine? my day's just starting.
speaker2: i'm sure. if i were you, i would use this time, to think about my life. and its direction. or lack thereof.
speaker1: what's wrong with my life?
speaker2: from all i've heard, just about everything. your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
speaker2: page 33
speaker2: if you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself. has brought you here. take the hint. mother superior leaves.

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: come on, we're late.
speaker1: what? what time is it?
speaker2: it's after five. we have to bathe.
speaker1: five a.m.?

speaker1: isn't it a glorious morning? good morning, mary clarence. sleep well? 
speaker2: right.
speaker3: is this like your old convent?
speaker1: which convent was that, sister?
speaker2: which convent? it was, um, the little sisters... of the moonlight. in vegas. everybody used to come to mass. frank. dean. sammy. right at ringside.
speaker4: enough jabber.
speaker2: what?
speaker4: progressive convents. vanity. it sounds awful. it sounds just like this place.
speaker2: like this place?
speaker4: i like my old convent, in vancouver. out in the woods. it wasn't all modern, like here. no electricity. cold water. bare feet. those were nuns. it was on earth, but i loved it. this place is a hilton.

speaker1: the nuns giggle. 
speaker2: where did that come from?
speaker3: i haven't heard that song in ages. the ronettes?
speaker4: shirelles.
speaker2: you know that song?
speaker3: 1961? '62? mary clarence, that's when many of us took final vows. it's the last secular music we recall.
speaker2: no.

speaker1: page 36. 
speaker2: that's enough. we've got to get to chapel.
speaker3: anybody got conditioner?

speaker1: there was a raid on a pawnshop in l.a. this morning. the place was fencing stolen property. they found this. 
speaker2: data-base hoods. it's a wonderful world. beloved daughter missing. reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. please find our adored angel, we miss her so. dead or alive.
speaker3: vince is getting desperate. where is she, eddie? where'd you stash her?
speaker2: where's who?
speaker3: you won't even tell us?
speaker2: i wouldn't even tell the pope.

speaker1: good afternoon, young ladies. and welcome to our christian youth group. 
speaker1: hi. i hope we'll have some fun, and maybe learn a little something, too. now, today's topic is something very up-to- date -- "teenage promiscuity." my. now, can anyone tell me -- just what is promiscuity?
speaker1: anyone? yes?
speaker2: uh, it's like, you know, doin' it. a whole lot. till your head falls off.
speaker3: sister mary patrick?
speaker1: yes?
speaker3: i need to see you, at once. girls, please excuse sister mary patrick for a few moments. mary clarence?
speaker4: yeah?
speaker3: girls, this is sister mary clarence. she'll be minding you until sister mary patrick's return. mary clarence, please assign a biblical passage. do not attempt discussion. am i understood?
speaker4: i got it.
speaker3: come, sister.
speaker4: so, hi there. i'm... sister mary clarence. and you're... young christians. i guess i should assign you this passage. what's good? what were you talking about?
speaker2: we were talking about the wild thing. teen promiscuity.
speaker4: really.
speaker5: yeah. sister mary pat was discussing it. you know she thinks it's a sin.
speaker4: well... yes. yes it is.
speaker2: how come? sister?
speaker4: well... because it's in the bible. "thou shalt not..." thou shalt not.
speaker4: excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? at sunday school?
speaker2: 'cause we love it so much. and cause we gotta come here. probation.
speaker4: probation?
speaker5: yeah. we all got caught. shoplifting. cuttin' school. cuttin' up some with a blade. so we gotta come here. so we'll be good, in the future. so we'll learn valuable lessons. and i learned mine. i will be incredibly good, i will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again. can i go now?
speaker4: yeah, you learned a whole lot, i can tell.
speaker2: well, what would you know about it, anyway? what do any of you nunheads know about anything? about doin' the nasty, or gettin' high?
speaker6: leave her alone, lawanda, she's just some ol' nun! don't pick on no nun, it's bad luck!
speaker4: shut up!
speaker4: okay, so maybe i'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something? you want to listen, for once in your little lives? you want to pay some attention?
speaker5: what about crack? you a user?
speaker4: i said i was a nun, not an
speaker7: got you, charlene!
speaker6: dunked by the nun!
speaker2: well, what about the stuff? what if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow. like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it. oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
speaker4: and you listen to that?
speaker2: no, but... i don't know... sometimes.
speaker4: hey, i know, it's hard. but do what i do.
speaker2: what you do?
speaker4: just tell him, i do love you, but i can't -- i'm a nun.
speaker5: but, like what if you are doin' it? what about protection? who's responsible?
speaker6: what about them things, you know, for the guy? aren't they like, a mess to put on? don't they kinda mess up the mood?
speaker4: deal with it, sweet thing. it's important, nowadays. you just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
speaker3: mary clarence!
speaker4: because a banana is part of a balanced breakfast. and don't forget fiber.

speaker1: a balloon and a banana! tell me, mary clarence, what were you thinking? 
speaker2: those girls were asking questions. they've got it rough. i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age. i wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
speaker1: this is a convent, not a clinic. we offer moral guidance, not hardware.
speaker2: have you been out in those streets? do you know what those kids are up against? you should help them!
speaker1: we are nuns. we seek solutions through prayer.
speaker2: sometimes it's not enough!
speaker1: you are correct. sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation. such as your own, for example. how do you feel about physical labor?
speaker2: it never solves anything.
speaker1: do your recall the words of saint peter, in ecciesiastes 1:27? he spoke unto a wastrel youth. he said, "take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
speaker2: in english?
speaker1: how to put it... ah, of course, mary clarence. "no pain, no gain."

speaker1: soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely? 
speaker2: it's that call you were expecting, vince.
speaker1: can you hold? can you try? passes the phone to vince. t page 43
speaker1: have you found out where christy is yet? hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! you want to try making it on a cop's salary? find her, and find her now! vince passes the phone back to willy.
speaker1: raise the ante to three hundred grand.
speaker1: sorry, baby... you are? totally? not a stitch?... yeah, i'm naked too... inside...

speaker1: the minute i saw you. i said to myself, she's a weaver. have you ever used a loom? 
speaker2: not in years.
speaker1: well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. i'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: to sell, of course. i hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at st. katherine's. we need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
speaker2: but don't you get money? from the vatican?
speaker1: mary clarence. goose. we're completely self-supporting. like all convents. like yours.
speaker2: oh, right. at my old place, we used to... wash cars. groom dogs. so... nice loom.
speaker1: isn't it lovely? now i'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. you just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. keep tension on the warp. is that clear?
speaker2: just about. show me again.
speaker1: you betcha.

speaker1: shuttle, beat, shed. and watch your heddles. 
speaker2: i love my heddles. show me again.
speaker3: mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
speaker1: oh, she's doing just fine, reverend mother - page 45.
speaker2: really catching on.
speaker3: good. mary patrick, i need you in the office. mary clarence, carry on.

speaker1: i'm sorry, i'm not a weaver! 
speaker2: months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
speaker1: look, this isn't my kind of thing! i wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! i don't do that! i'm a star!

speaker1: let me talk to detective eddie mulcahy. it's an emergency. real bad. 
speaker2: mulcahy.
speaker1: eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
speaker3: not again. you can't keep calling. somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
speaker1: but i'm going insane! all these people do is pray and work, work and pray! i don't get it -- when's the weekend? they have gruel, eddie, that's what they call food! gruel -- it's like alpo for nuns! i sleep in a cell, on a board, and i pray five times a days do you know what i pray for, eddie, do you have any idea? check your crotch, eddie --anything fall off yet? get me outta her!
speaker3: calm down. look, i didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
speaker1: like what?
speaker3: keeping our witnesses alive. we hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
speaker1: you
speaker3: i just need a few more weeks,
speaker1: but it's a nightmare! mother superior is out to get me! she hates my guts! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
speaker1: do you hear that? that choir? eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
speaker3: don't call again. it's not safe. i'll be in touch.

speaker1: yeah? 
speaker1: what? what does she want now? i did the dishes. i oiled the pews. i dusted the hymnals. two hundred hymnals. why can't people share?
speaker2: page 48.
speaker1: what?
speaker3: i... i brought you something.
speaker1: a cigarette?
speaker3: an extra heel of bread. please take it, you need your strength. you've been working so hard.
speaker1: thanks. so which one are you? sister bruce? sister doug?
speaker3: mary robert. i'm... mary robert.
speaker1: right. okay. bob. nice to know you.
speaker1: so, bob, how long have you been in? st. k's?
speaker3: three years. sister.
speaker1: three years. a rookie.
speaker3: a novice.
speaker1: yeah, like a learner's permit, right? when do you hit the big time? you know, when do you take the final vows?
speaker1: whoa! bob! what's going on here? what'd i say?
speaker3: you have to help me
speaker1: right, sure, but what's the problem? are they keeping you a prisoner here? do they drug you? did reverend mother like, kidnap your parents? we can call the enquirer.
speaker3: no, you don't understand -- i don't want to get out! i want to get in?
speaker1: excuse me?
speaker3: oh. mary clarence, i'm so unworthy. i want to take my final vows, i would do it tomorrow, but reverend mother won't let me!
speaker1: she won't? why not?
speaker3: she says i should wait. she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life. she says that i'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet. in a mature manner.
speaker1: she said that? reverend mother?
speaker1: well, then there's only one thing to do.
speaker3: what?
speaker1: reverend mother says you need experience, right, in life. in order to make a responsible decision. this is going to be very painful for me. you know how much i love this little room. this whole convent. wait.
speaker1: must i do this thing, 0 lord? please help me.,. yes, i know... i must put my selfish cares aside... i must think of others... yes, she's here... he says hi... yes, i understand... let thy will be done. amen. you too. christy turns to mary robert, having received a holy message.
speaker1: we must do this sacred thing, mary robert.
speaker3: of course! we must do it! it's the will of what is it?
speaker1: we must... get you some experience. we must... leave this place.
speaker3: are you sure?
speaker1: we hear you.

speaker1: are you sure this is what reverend mother had in mind? 
speaker2: i know it is. it's life. experience. take a deep breath.
speaker1: mary clarence!
speaker2: now you.
speaker2: it's a start.

speaker1: how are you doing. 
speaker2: hey, sisters. are you going in there?
speaker1: you know it.
speaker3: we need experience.
speaker1: and you, with the devil's brew passing through your lips. a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

speaker1: bobs 
speaker2: experience! right?
speaker1: right.
speaker1: a couple of bowls of chili. and another round of these.
speaker2: i have to do this. so i can become a nun.
speaker1: initiation. you understand. later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
speaker2: really?
speaker1: and she wants to be a nun.
speaker2: who are all these people?
speaker1: this is your neighborhood. your turf. you should get to know 'em.
speaker3: hey, sisters -- how you doin'?
speaker1: better now.
speaker3: how come they let you out? out of that convent place?
speaker1: time off. for bad behavior.
speaker3: oww! a nun havin' fun! i don't believe it! it's good to have you ladies in this fine establishment. so... anybody on the move?
speaker2: i am.
speaker1: bob! what're you doing?
speaker2: i'm getting experience.
speaker1: you watch yourself!
speaker4: do it, sisters!
speaker5: sway and pray!

speaker1: those people are wonderful! why don't we ever see them in church? 
speaker2: good point. especially that dude you were with. i'd like to see him down front.
speaker1: mary clarence! you're so... different from the other sisters. sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
speaker2: honey.
speaker1: i can't wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences. i've learned so much.
speaker2: well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything. i mean, nothing really happened. we just... took a walk.
speaker2: run!

speaker1: mary clarence! 
speaker2: keep moving!
speaker2: climb! now!
speaker2: it!
speaker1: mary clarence!

speaker1: oh my lord! 
speaker2: experience!

speaker1: what was all that? who was that man? why would he shoot at us? 
speaker2: i don't know, some people just don't like nuns. i wish i had a ruler.
speaker1: we could have been killed! but you saved me! thank you, mary clarence!
speaker3: yes -- thank you so much.

speaker1: what'd she say? 
speaker2: you blew it -- big time. she doesn't want you back.
speaker1: does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
speaker2: she's counting on it. she's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. or a carnival.
speaker1: so what am i supposed to do in the meantime?
speaker2: go in and talk to her. it can't hurt. go.

speaker1: so... hi there. 
speaker2: i don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
speaker1: look... i know i shouldn't have, i'm incredibly sorry about mary robert, i wasn't thinking, i didn't know that would happen! page 58.
speaker2: mary robert's life was in danger! your behavior was inexcusable!
speaker1: i know! i'm sorry i didn't mean for it to happen! and i was the one they were shooting at!
speaker2: mary clarence, i have given you every opportunity. to change. to make a decent life for yourself.
speaker1: a decent life? excuse me? as what? a janitor?
speaker2: clearly, you have learned nothing. and you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
speaker1: but you can't kick me out! guys want to kill me! you're a nun! a big nun! aren't you supposed to have compassion? for the wayward sheep? i mean, i'm a major sinner! all-time great! hall of fame! aren't i, like, your dream come true? your olympic event? mother superior stares at christy.
speaker2: mary clarence, perhaps you are correct.
speaker1: i am?
speaker2: you may stay. but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: you have, i believe, some minimal background in music. therefore, you are to join our choir.
speaker2: page 59
speaker2: you will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart. as almost no one attends mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
speaker1: no. no.
speaker2: you're my olympic event.
speaker1: not the choir, please, anything but that. the choir -- i mean, have you heard them? i'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that i
speaker2: the choir, mary clarence. go for the gold.

speaker1: is this... choir practice? 
speaker2: sure is! come on in, and sing a spell.
speaker1: mary robert, i am so sorry about last night...
speaker3: now stop that. you didn't shoot at me. you were only trying to help, to give me experience. i tried to explain that to reverend mother, but -- i don't know if she understood.
speaker4: soprano or alto?
speaker1: whatever. page 60.

speaker1: we're looking for mike. 
speaker2: you found him -- but we're not open yet.
speaker2: hey -- the till's empty!
speaker1: i'm sorry -- i don't know what gets into him.
speaker2: who are you guys?
speaker1: we're the guys from vegas. you had christy last night, but you let her get away. it's upsetting.
speaker2: but you didn't tell me!
speaker1: we didn't tell you what?
speaker2: that she's a nun! that chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
speaker3: what? christy?
speaker1: a nun?
speaker2: i'm telling you!
speaker3: gimme a hand here.
speaker1: a nun!

speaker1: mary clarence, are you with us? 
speaker2: um, i don't really know this one...
speaker3: mary clarence has a background in music. that's what reverend mother said.
speaker4: really, mary clarence? were you a choirmistress?
speaker2: sure. kind of... free-lance.
speaker1: free-lance? oh really? you think i don't see? you think i took vows yesterday? i know what you're up to. you and reverend mother.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: you're a ringer. she brought you in to replace me. out with the old.
speaker2: hold on.
speaker4: mary clarence, could you? mary lazarus, you're terrific, but... could you help us?
speaker5: please?
speaker5: you've heard us.
speaker1: well.
speaker1: there's a word for this -- mutiny. so, mary clarence, you think you can do better. i believe i'd like to see that. i'm out to pasture. dry dock. the glue factory. go ahead, sister -- make 'em sing.
speaker2: well...

speaker1: man. i sound like you guys. 
speaker2: very nice. sisters, have we learned our lesson? i won't hold this little episode against anyone. i'll try not to.
speaker1: mary robert. mary robert jumps, startled by the attention.
speaker3: what?
speaker1: mary robert, i've watched you. you never really sing. you whisper. nothing comes out.
speaker3: i don't want to mess anyone up...
speaker1: give me a c.

speaker1: louder! like you're onstage. 
speaker1: like people are eating, and there's silverware, and you want them to hear you.
speaker1: think about that guy you were dancing with!
speaker2: oh my!
speaker1: you see? we've got the voices. they're just allover the place. i've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. better than me. we just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
speaker3: chops?
speaker1: the goods. the sound. the sale. let's rearrange a few things. mary patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto. get over here. mary robert --with the sopranos.
speaker1: sister alma -- a c.
speaker1: middle section, hold that note, for dear life. sopranos, an a. sister alma?
speaker3: we did it! we actually sang a chord!
speaker2: that was exciting!
speaker1: yeah, for one second. that was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other. be a group.
speaker4: i knew that.
speaker1: mary lazarus, i get the feeling that you like discipline. hard work. page 65.
speaker4: of course. i'm a nun. four popes now. the lord hates a loafer.
speaker1: i hear you. how many days a week do you rehearse?
speaker3: two days. an hour or so.
speaker1: no way. we're a choir, right? headliners. the big room. two days a week won't cut it. every day.
speaker4: she's good.
speaker2: do you really think we could do it? get better?
speaker1: i don't know. mary lazarus, what do you think? they're pretty raw.
speaker4: wet behind the ears.
speaker1: a bunch of real mama's girls.
speaker3: oh, please? can't we try?
speaker1: it'll be hell.
speaker4: tell me about it.
speaker1: ten-hut!

speaker1: that machine. 
speaker2: i know. it's ancient.
speaker1: it's a rhythm section. the beat.
speaker1: mary patrick -- do you remember the dixie cups?
speaker2: the dixie cups? oh my. i was just a girl. of course.

speaker1: hold it. mary patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you? 
speaker2: am i?
speaker2: all right, i am, i know it! all my life, i've just been... upbeat. optimistic. perky. i can't help it. even when i was little, i remember my mother used to say, "that child is pure sunshine. she'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
speaker1: so use it. when we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? celebration. most music is. so don't hold back. let all that joy go right into your voice. make me happy. let me hear it. perk out. perk down.

speaker1: good morning, reverend mother. 
speaker2: good morning, sisters.

speaker1: welcome this sunday morning, 0 ye few and faithful. page 68. 
speaker1: the choir, i am told, has elected a new director -- sister mary clarence, who will lead them in hymn 127.

speaker1: page 69. 
speaker2: but how?

speaker1: sister alma! 
speaker1: mary robert! page 70.

speaker1: gospel. a jazz solo on the organ. what next? goes to rio? good friday-a- go-go? what were you thinking? 
speaker2: i was thinking las vegas. get some butts in those seats.
speaker1: and what next? popcorn? curtain calls? this is not a theater. or a casino.
speaker2: exactly. people like going to theaters and casinos. but they think church is for grandma -- we could change that. pack the joint.
speaker1: through blasphemy? you have corrupted the entire choir!
speaker2: hold on. that's not fair. i worked hard with them. they gave up their free time, and they loved it. those women are happy. and we can get even better. we can wake this place up.
speaker1: out of the question.
speaker2: please let me try. i'm begging you.
speaker1: and i am refusing. as of tomorrow, mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
speaker3: reverend mother, i just wanted to congratulate you.
speaker1: oh?
speaker3: i haven't enjoyed mass this much in years. what a marvelous program. innovative. inspiring. you are to be commended.
speaker1: well... thank you.
speaker3: i can't wait until next sunday, when the choir performs again. did you see the people walk right in from the street? that music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
speaker1: perhaps.
speaker3: i must tell the cardinal. i.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
speaker1: really?
speaker2: excuse me, bishop. reverend mother has some other ideas too. she's too modest to talk about it, but she thinks we should get out of the convent and into the neighborhood more. this woman.
speaker4: bless her! there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve. that's why many of us became nuns. it's marvelous, reverend mother.
speaker1: really...
speaker2: you know reverend mother. hides her light under a bushel. she has plans for us to move right onto the streets. get to know people. work with 'em.
speaker3: you're a pioneer.
speaker1: but, bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
speaker5: and you'll face that danger head-on. as if i could stop you. and you have my complete support in this matter. anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
speaker2: don't you love her?

speaker1: don't look at your feet, and i don't want to see anybody counting. make it look easy. again! 
speaker2: right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
speaker1: hopeless i
speaker2: amateurs 2
speaker1: babies
speaker2: again!

speaker1: we're here to pray for you, brother. 
speaker2: what? get the out of here.
speaker1: we know you don't want to sell drugs. you just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability. you just need someone to pray for you.
speaker3: we know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. we'll pray to find you some honest work.
speaker1: and we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! we know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. and so you truly need our prayers.
speaker4: what is this? outta my way!
speaker1: yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free we're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
speaker5: we're nuns!
speaker3: free prayers right over here! drive up and get your prayers!
speaker2: you're hassling my customers! that's not legal! i know my rights. this is restriction of trade.
speaker1: you wanna call a cop? page 76.
speaker3: are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
speaker6: is it worth it? a lot of witnesses here.
speaker1: can i get a witness?
speaker2: so i'll find another neighborhood to do my business. you can' t stop me.
speaker1: if we can stop you here, they can stop you there.
speaker7: it was a truly remarkable scene, as the nuns from st. katherine's literally drove the crack dealers from the neighborhood, led by the feisty sister mary clarence.
speaker8: vinnie, get in here. you gotta see this!
speaker9: what? nuns? you got me in here to see nuns? isn't there a ball game on or something?
speaker8: look -- she's adorable!

speaker1: this tiny convent has experienced an amazing turnaround. the sisters have revitalized and taken back their neighborhood, all due to the energy and talent of the convent choir, a group led by this gifted young nun. tell us, mary clarence1 what makes you so special? 
speaker2: oh, i'm not special, bob. it's just hard work... and prayer.

speaker1: eddie! you scared the out of me! 
speaker2: what if i was vince? you'd be dead right now. what are you doing giving interviews on tv?
speaker1: it wasn't my fault! they just showed up. it's helping the convent.
speaker2: you're supposed to be hiding out!
speaker1: i really can't talk about it now. the place is packed. sro. i've got a show to do.
speaker2: listen to yourself. this isn't a career opportunity.
speaker1: i know that. this isn't about me. it's about the choir. you should hear them. they're good. really good. and i taught them.
speaker2: look at you you're glowing.
speaker1: i am?
speaker2: yeah. you look... great. i mean it..
speaker1: really? lieutenant?
speaker2: i've been worried about you.
speaker1: you mean -- worried about my testimony?
speaker2: no -- worried about you. personally.
speaker1: well.. thanks. i've been thinking about you.. - sometimes. i mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here. i mean, sometimes i feel like... a nun.
speaker2: me too.
speaker1: you're not... seeing anybody?
speaker2: no. most of the time i'm thinking about you. and now... you've really changed.
speaker1: i have?
speaker2: you re sort of... radiant. your eyes are shining. you're rea1ly different...
speaker2: you're... you're a nun.
speaker1: we're in a convent!
speaker1: i've got to go.
speaker2: just remember - you're a target. don't you think vince has a t.v.?
speaker1: magic time! page 80.

speaker1: this sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of mary magdalene. you know the one. mary magdalene was a young lady with a past. she was no stranger to sin. she was no stranger to practically everybody. many condemned her. the whole neighborhood. but one man refused to do so. one man said, hey now, wait a minute. listen to the story. 
speaker1: hey, girls.
speaker2: hail, mary.
speaker1: jerusalem is a real drag. everybody hates me.
speaker2: oh-huh.
speaker1: people throw stones. they call me names. i mean, really.
speaker2: really.
speaker1: but -- wait.
speaker3: what is it, mary?
speaker1: that man -- who is he?
speaker4: he's a carpenter.
speaker3: he's not like other guys.
speaker4: he's decent.
speaker3: he's kind.
speaker1: he's... dreamy. he's...
speaker5: yes, mary?

speaker1: jackpot! two buckets 
speaker2: this is so exhilarating! all week long, i can't wait till sunday, when we sing.
speaker3: i'd rather sing than do anything!
speaker2: it's better than ice cream.
speaker3: it's better than springtime.
speaker1: it's better than sex!
speaker1: i imagine.
speaker4: better and better, sisters, you are truly an inspiration. and i bear gladsome tidings.
speaker4: i've kept the cardinal informed of your progress in the neighborhood. he has been most impressed. and he has invited you to attend a special evening mass at st. matthew's cathedral on sunday night1 to sing for the council of cardinals.
speaker5: that is indeed glorious news, bishop. we will be honored to appear.
speaker5: page 83.
speaker5: and on such an occasion, i feel a completely traditional program will be best.
speaker1: what do you mean?
speaker5: the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church. they command the utmost respect. your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
speaker2: but, reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style.
speaker3: it's brought people back to the church.
speaker1: isn't that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals?
speaker5: i believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
speaker1: a vote?
speaker5: of course. mary clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. a membership that, i am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program?
speaker1: but... wait a minute...
speaker5: the majority has spoken.
speaker6: reverend mother, as always, you are a true leader. gracious and understanding.
speaker3: it will be wonderful, reverend mother. you'll see.
speaker7: she's a pro.
speaker1: what?
speaker5: i am certain the presentation will be a great success. congratulations, mary clarence. and congratulations to you all.

speaker1: you sent for me? 
speaker2: you have a phone call.
speaker1: hello?
speaker3: good news, kid. i pulled a few strings the judge has agreed to move the trial up. we'll be in court in a couple of days.
speaker1: that soon?
speaker3: forty-eight hours -- and you'll be a free woman.
speaker1: great. that's good to hear.
speaker3: hey, don't thank me or anything.
speaker1: right, right -- thanks.
speaker1: hey -- your prayers have been answered. i'm leaving. in just a couple of days.
speaker2: really. well, that makes two of us.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara. privately. i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
speaker1: but -- why?
speaker2: i must go where i can be of use.
speaker1: but -- there's so much more to do right here. and look, if it's about me, i mean, i'm gone.
speaker2: indeed. after how long? a few weeks? i have been here thirty years. and yet, it would seem, i know nothing.
speaker1: but everything that's happening is good! you can be a part of it!
speaker2: a part of what? mary clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday. you have raised the sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them. they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
speaker2: page 86.
speaker2: you and i know that life is not so simple. there will be disappointments. rude shocks. and you will have vanished. how... fortunate.
speaker1: okay, so i just got things started. but you could build on that. you could keep it going.
speaker2: i am sorry, mary clarence. i seem to have misplaced my tambourine. good day, mary clarence.
speaker1: but...
speaker2: good day.

speaker1: ice cream! 
speaker2: mary clarence -- you shouldn't have. where did you get this?
speaker3: it's a sin. it's a wicked indulgence. is this butter almond? page 87.
speaker4: it's contraband. don't ask. but i wanted to give you a treat. a sort of... thank-you gift.
speaker1: a thank-you? for what? you're the one we should be thanking.
speaker3: is there any syrup?
speaker4: well... see, at my old convent, i wasn't always... real popular. i was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. okay, i'll say it -- i wasn't much of a nun. but now, thanks to all of you... maybe i'm shaping up.
speaker1: mary clarence, don't be silly. you're an example to us all. you've taught us so much. we're singing for the cardinals, and then -- who knows? maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
speaker2: maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
speaker3: we could cut a demo. look for a label.
speaker4: that's true, wouldn't that be great. of course, we never know when things are going to change. any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
speaker1: are you leaving us?
speaker4: oh no. we'll always be together.
speaker3: that's what diana ross said. page 88.

speaker1: you're too late. mulcahy just left. 
speaker2: i need his signature on some things. they can't be processed without it.
speaker1: leave 'em. he'll sign 'em later.
speaker1: what the is this...?

speaker1: tate said you were gone. 
speaker2: i get all the way down to my car, and, of course -- where are the keys?
speaker1: i left the money vouchers with him. he said you'd sign them in the morning.

speaker1: st. katherine's convent on east barton. it's gotta be the place. 
speaker2: you're the leak, you
speaker2: get him out of here! downstairs, in the cell! i want his locked up now!
speaker2: clarkson, get on the other line. call frisco central. tell 'em to get two squad cars outside st. katherine's convent, and stop anybody with an out-of- state license plate from getting near the place.

speaker1: the council of cardinals! i'm so nervous! what if i forget the words? 
speaker2: right to hell. just kidding. where is that bus?
speaker3: it should be here any minute.
speaker4: dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30. sharp.

speaker1: reverend mother! quick! where's christy? 
speaker2: what's wrong?
speaker1: they know she's here! they're on their way!
speaker2: the rehearsal room!

speaker1: it's here! let's go! 
speaker2: hurry, sister!
speaker3: get moving. i'm right behind you.
speaker3: eddie...?
speaker4: vince knows you're here.
speaker3: how?
speaker4: long story. his goons will be here any minute. we've got to get you out of here '- now!
speaker3: i can't go with you.
speaker4: what?
speaker3: i've got a show -- at st. matthew's cathedral. we're singing for the cardinals.
speaker4: you're gonna be singing for st. peter if you don't get your out of here!

speaker1: mary clarence! sister! 
speaker2: it's no use. she just isn't here.
speaker1: it doesn't make any sense. she was right behind me...
speaker2: we can't sing without her! what should we do?

speaker1: eddie -- i've got to go back. they won't sing without me. i'm deserting them. 
speaker2: i think they'd understand.
speaker1: that's not the point! they need me!
speaker2: they need you? a bunch of nuns? for what? moral guidance? make-up tips?
speaker1: you don't get it! it's a big thing for them, it's like... caesar's palace. prime-time. they're singing for the cardinals. it's like... "star search." if first prize was a trip to the vatican. they've worked really hard, they deserve this.
speaker2: nuns?
speaker1: they're not nuns. they're like.. people. with one outfit.

speaker1: so that guy in the bar was right? she's like... some kind of nun? 
speaker2: yeah, right -- when i see it.
speaker3: you dudes looking for nuns? they all went to st. matthew's.
speaker1: st, matthew's? thanks.
speaker3: praise the lord.

speaker1: what're you doing? 
speaker2: even nuns have to pee.

speaker1: oh my 
speaker1: i'm late for church. can i get a lift? page 96.

speaker1: is this the choir you've been speaking so highly of, bishop? 
speaker2: they're just a bit nervous. they'll be fine.
speaker3: we sound terrible we need mary clarence.
speaker4: we're losing it.
speaker5: i don't understand. where is she?
speaker6: her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her. pull yourselves together.
speaker7: okay, sisters, we have to move on now. that was great, just great. charlie, throw a spot on the pulpit. let's get a balance.

speaker1: excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room? 
speaker2: the rehearsal room is right this way.
speaker3: wait, this isn't the way. who are you?
speaker1: they're from my old convent.
speaker1: run! take off!
speaker3: again?

speaker1: go! 
speaker2: but what do they want? where are we going?
speaker3: she's got nothing to do with this. let her go.
speaker4: yeah, right to the cops. no way.
speaker3: mary robert, don't panic. remember what we talked about? experience?
speaker4: what?
speaker3: you can handle this.
speaker3: go!
speaker4: she's gettin' away!
speaker1: forget her! we got the one we need! step on it! joey takes off again.

speaker1: you mean -- they kidnapped her? 
speaker2: yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
speaker3: she shouldn't have come back. she knew she was in danger.
speaker1: but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
speaker4: were they catholics?
speaker3: she isn't a nun. her real name is christy van cartier, and she is a professional entertainer. she witnessed a vicious crime, and has been hiding in our convent.
speaker2: an... entertainer?
speaker1: she wasn't a nun?
speaker5: she lied to us?
speaker2: but... but... she was such a wonderful nun.
speaker1: look what she did with the choir. she made us sing beautifully.
speaker4: that should have tipped us.
speaker2: well, i don't care who she is. we can't sing without her!
speaker1: she's our inspiration!
speaker4: she's the act!
speaker2: reverend mother, i know that you and mary clarence didn't always agree, but -- we've got to help her.
speaker1: we've got to save her!
speaker4: we can't leave it up to the feds!
speaker3: calm down. think clearly. mary robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
speaker2: she said they were from her old convent.
speaker3: but... she was a showgirl. she didn't have an old convent.
speaker1: she told us about one. the little sisters of the moonlight. in las vegas.
speaker3: all right. it's a beginning. las vegas, nevada.
speaker3: mary lazarus, find the bishop and tell him the situation. everyone else -- follow me.

speaker1: emergency! open up! 
speaker1: the san francisco airport! immediately!
speaker2: step on it!

speaker1: where is she? 
speaker2: there was a kidnapping. we think las vegas.
speaker3: fifteen hundred for the run to vegas. rock-bottom.
speaker4: but we don't have fifteen hundred!
speaker5: we're nuns!
speaker3: can't help you. no exceptions.
speaker6: young man! page 102.
speaker3: what?
speaker6: we are nuns. we pray.
speaker3: so?
speaker6: we pray for good things. food for the hungry.
speaker4: peace on earth.
speaker6: however, we can also pray for other things.
speaker4: measles.
speaker5: lawsuits.
speaker7: tax audits.
speaker6: come, sisters. let's go to chapel. bring your beads.
speaker3: wait!

speaker1: babe. 
speaker1: babe, what happened here? look at you.
speaker2: good evening, vincent.
speaker1: what, vincent? this is me, doll. i know you. what did you think you were doing? running to the cops. hiding out. no, no. you're sorry now, aren't you?
speaker2: i am sorry for all my sins. and yours.
speaker3: she's a nun, vince.
speaker1: i love you, chris. i always will. i gave you so much. my time. my affection. a big-time career. and how do you repay me? what's the thanks i get? where's the loyalty, huh? where's the love?
speaker2: you will be judged, vincent. we all will.
speaker1: what do you mean -- judged? i don't get judged, baby.
speaker1: page 104.
speaker1: and who are you to talk? you were nothing. you couldn't even sing. i must have been out of my mind.
speaker3: she's acting weird, vince. ever since we picked her up.
speaker4: it's spooky. it's like she ain't even afraid or nothing.
speaker1: she's afraid. come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
speaker1: who gives a damn? waste her.

speaker1: it's so beautiful... 
speaker2: and what a lovely name. las vegas...
speaker3: and gommorah.

speaker1: it's done? 
speaker2: not... totally.
speaker1: what's the problem?
speaker3: she's... she's a nun.
speaker1: are you nuts? she's not a nun. it's christy. she's a babe!
speaker2: but, vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
speaker1: it didn't happen.
speaker3: she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
speaker2: no smart-ass remarks or nothing.
speaker1: i can't believe this. okay, i want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
speaker2: yeah...
speaker3: right. that way we'd never know which bullet got to her brain and killed her first. it could always be the other guy.

speaker1: okay, we got one-two-three, and on three we both shoot. got it? page 106. 
speaker2: got it.
speaker1: one... two...
speaker1: three!
speaker1: you didn't shoot!
speaker2: neither did you!
speaker1: i figured if you were gonna, then i wouldn't have to.
speaker2: that's what i figured, too.

speaker1: las vegas -- she's here somewhere. 
speaker2: but where?
speaker3: look! there she is!
speaker1: the little sisters of the moonlight!
speaker3: but how do we get there?
speaker2: stand back. taxi!
speaker4: well?
speaker5: it didn't work, vince.
speaker4: you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
speaker6: we both missed.
speaker4: okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
speaker5: right.
speaker4: so, take it off.
speaker6: strip down a nun? you want us to fry?
speaker5: for like, twelve zillion eternities?
speaker4: i'm telling you, she's not a nun! get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
speaker5: maybe pants.
speaker6: a sweater.
speaker5: and then we can ice her. no nun, no evil eye.

speaker1: we got it all worked out. 
speaker2: okay, christy -- strip.
speaker3: what?
speaker2: that... thing. that nun thing. take it off.
speaker1: what's she doing?
speaker2: she's praying.
speaker3: and bless joey and willy, who are only trying to do their jobs. pox fibula tibia vobiscum. et marcus domino's pizza. have mercy. amen. i'm finished now. help me up.

speaker1: there she goes! she's taking the stairs 
speaker2: they run quickly after her.

speaker1: brace yourselves, sisters. 
speaker1: spread out and look for mary clarence. try to blend in.

speaker1: excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun? 
speaker2: a benedictine.

speaker1: place your bets. 
speaker2: red 21.
speaker3: you sure? how do you know?
speaker3: red 21.
speaker1: black 14.
speaker2: did you learn something?

speaker1: what are you doing here? 
speaker2: saving you. move!
speaker2: break!
speaker3: get her!
speaker4: which one!
speaker3: the nun!
speaker3: babe.
speaker2: sweetheart.

speaker1: there's nuns everywhere! hundreds of 'em! 
speaker2: there she is!
speaker3: which one?
speaker4: quick, there's another way out of here. follow me. page 113.
speaker2: she's heading for the lounge! go!
speaker5: move in -- now!

speaker1: i can't see anything in here! 
speaker2: -- hit the lights.
speaker3: where?
speaker2: find 'em!
speaker1: there! before he can shoot, there is another flash of fabric on the opposite side of the room.
speaker2: no -- there!
speaker1: over there!
speaker2: freeze! everybody! page 114.
speaker2: joey?
speaker1: where is she?
speaker4: right here. let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
speaker2: joey -- do it.
speaker1: but, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
speaker2: she's a broad! got it! just some broad!
speaker5: i guarantee you, she is no broad. she is sister mary clarence, of st. katherine's convent. she is a model of generosity, virtue and love. you have my word, gentlemen. she is a nun.
speaker3: hear that? now aren't you glad we didn't shoot her?
speaker6: mary clarence -- you're alive!
speaker7: christy.
speaker8: van cartier.
speaker4: you know? about me? about everything?
speaker4: reverend mother -- thank-you.
speaker5: oh?
speaker4: you saved my life.
speaker5: i'm a christian.
speaker9: don't you have a concert to go to?
speaker4: that depends. sisters, you don't know this, but reverend mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. that's bad news. i don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
speaker6: not a note.
speaker7: impossible.
speaker4: then i guess you're stuck. life sentence. no parole.
speaker5: very well. i hold you responsible for all of this, for introducing a lounge act into my convent. for utterly disrupting our way of life. and for placing all of us in mortal danger. thank-you. page 116.
speaker4: yeah, eddie, thanks a whole bunch. thanks for sticking me in a convent. so you think, after all this, maybe i really am a nun?
speaker9: i don't know. there's only one way to be absolutely sure.
speaker4: yeah, like what?
speaker2: i was good to you! you re nothing but no-talent garbage! you're a two-bit tramp!
speaker4: that used to be true, vince. i was with you. but something happened. and i'm different now. real--different. i've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience. and i've got just two words for you. and those two words are...
speaker6: mary clarence!
speaker4: bless you.

speaker1: i just realized -- this is the last time we'll all be together. we're going to miss you so much. page 117. christy and mary patrick embrace. mary patrick is tearful. 
speaker2: hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. why do i suddenly feel like snow white?
speaker3: you re okay -- for a civilian.
speaker4: reverend mother?
speaker5: yes?
speaker4: since mary clarence came to st. katherine's, i've been shot at, kidnapped by mafia hit men, and i've tasted beer. is that enough experience yet? for final vows?
speaker2: i don't think so. what about skydiving? a crank call to billy graham?
speaker5: you have evidenced great maturity, mary robert. we shall have a serious discussion.
speaker2: what about me, reverend mother? i think you were right. i'm just a bad influence. sister show biz.
speaker5: perhaps not. perhaps we can all use... a little spandex.
speaker2: really? and maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
speaker5: don't push it.
