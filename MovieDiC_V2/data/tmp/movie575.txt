speaker1: cole holds four fingers in front of his eyes. 
speaker2: federal? cole gives him the thumbs up.

speaker1: right, gordon. we'll be in touch. 
speaker2: that was really something. that dancing girl. what did it mean?
speaker1: code. if you work with gordon you learn that right away.
speaker2: code, i've heard a lot about this.
speaker1: sort of shorthand.
speaker2: shorthand. really?
speaker1: we're heading into a difficult situation.
speaker2: how do you figure?
speaker1: i'll explain it to you. do you remember lil's dance?

speaker1: lil was wearing a sour face. 
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. they are not going to be receptive to the fbi.

speaker1: desmond cole said lil was "his mother's sister's girl". what is missing in that sentence? 
speaker2: oh, the uncle is missing.
speaker3: not cole's uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
speaker2: so the sheriff had got an uncle who's committed a serious crime.

speaker1: right, which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. let me ask you something, stanley, did you notice anything about the dress? 
speaker2: the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
speaker1: gordon said you were good. the tailored dress is our code for drugs. did you notice what was pinned to it?
speaker2: a blue rose.
speaker1: very good, but i can't tell you about that.
speaker2: what did gordon's tie mean?
speaker1: what? that's just gordon's bad taste.
speaker2: why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
speaker1: he talks loud. and he loves his code.
speaker2: i see. he does talk loud.
speaker1: gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
speaker2: it must be a high priority situation.

speaker1: good afternoon, federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond. i'd like to see sheriff cable. 
speaker2: why don't you folks have a seat. make yourself at home. it's gonna be a while.
speaker1: okay, that's it. i've had enough of the waiting room now.
speaker2: oh.

speaker1: you can start that fresh pot of coffee right now. 
speaker2: how the did you...
speaker1: federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond.
speaker2: well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. i don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. in fact, when the state boys called me about a "j. edgar" coming up i think i said, "so what?"
speaker1: your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government.
speaker2: you're lucky i am not wasting you.
speaker1: well, little fella, let me put it this way. the operative word here would be "federal". with or without the semantics of all this, i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning teresa banks, both while living and deceased.
speaker2: a basic kill. banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. my boys have been all over this. it's a dead end.
speaker1: that's why we're here, sheriff cable.
speaker2: out back in our morgue desmond starts to leave. cable it's 4:30. we close at five.
speaker1: we've got our own clock. we'll lock up.

speaker1: teresa banks lived at the canyon trailer park for a month. we'll check that. and worked as a waitress at hap's truck stop. worked the night shift. good place for dinner when we're thru here, sam. no one came to claim the body and no known next of kin. as desmond is doing this, stanley takes out his special machine. 
speaker2: solved the whiteman case with this.
speaker1: that's what i heard.
speaker2: no one could find those splinters without a machine like this. and no one had a machine like this.
speaker1: that's good.
speaker2: yes, it is good. what do you think is in these other drawers?
speaker1: i don't know, sam.
speaker2: maybe, later we could take a look.
speaker1: sure, but let's finish up with this first.
speaker2: crushed skull. probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
speaker1: cole said she was 17.
speaker2: i wonder where her ring is? desmond notices the mark on her hand as well.
speaker1: yeah. personal effects include a watch, under garments, and a blue waitress uniform... the ring is missing. it says the rest of her things haven't been removed yet from the trailer. let's hope it's there.
speaker3: in stanley's hand.

speaker1: there appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand. 
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: a laceration.
speaker2: accidental?
speaker1: agent desmond, would you hold the finger for me. there's something up there.
speaker2: what is it?
speaker1: it is a piece of paper with the letter "t" imprinted on it. take a look. desmond comes around and takes a look. on a piece of paper.
speaker3: pondering what he has seen.

speaker1: geez, agent desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. where are we going to sleep? 
speaker2: we're not. you and i are going to get some food.
speaker1: yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. i didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, agent desmond? desmond takes a long look at stanley. stanley you've got your own m.o., don't you, agent desmond? desmond gets in and starts the car.

speaker1: had the fbi here once before. back in the fifties when hap was running the place. 
speaker2: where's hap?
speaker1: he's dead - good and dead.
speaker2: sorry to hear it.
speaker1: he didn't suffer.
speaker2: i'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks
speaker1: sheriff cable's already asked me a few questions about teresa banks. she worked nights for a month. that's it.
speaker2: any friends?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: ever see her with someone else?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: did she ever mention any friends?
speaker1: no. ask irene over there.

speaker1: take a good look around. there's nobody in this place - you're meetin' the reason why. what'll it be? 
speaker2: how come jack let's you work here?
speaker1: jack and i are united in holy matrimony.
speaker2: say no more.
speaker2: federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond. i'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks.
speaker1: she only worked here a month. nice
speaker2: what happened to her?
speaker1: there was only one job. teresa took the job. her friend took a hike. never saw her again.
speaker2: did you ever see teresa take cocaine?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: do you take cocaine, irene?
speaker1: no, i do not. i never took cocaine or any other drugs. i don't take drugs.
speaker3: nicotine is a drug. caffeine is a drug.
speaker1: who's shorty? those drugs are legal.
speaker2: he's with me. anything you would like to tell us about teresa banks that would help us out?
speaker1: i've thought about that. i think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
speaker2: thanks.
speaker4: you talking about that little girl that was murdered?
speaker2: you have something to tell us?
speaker4: yeah.
speaker2: what?
speaker4: i can tell from shinolah. gets me along way down that road.
speaker3: you think we ought to question him?
speaker2: what time is it, stanley?
speaker3: oh...
speaker3: agent desmond, it's...
speaker2: it's late, sam.
speaker3: it's not late, it's early. really early.
speaker1: you know, i never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, teresa's arm went completely dead.
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: her left arm. it was numb. she said she couldn't use it. said it had no feeling. probably from the drugs she was taking. i just thought i ought to tell you.
speaker2: thanks.
speaker3: i doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. i could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland.
speaker2: i think that's a good idea.
speaker2: i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park.
speaker3: are you speaking to me in a code?
speaker2: no, sam, i'm speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say.
speaker3: in that case, we should go to the canyon trailer park.
speaker5: thanks, irene. good... good morning.
speaker3: thank it is morning.

speaker1: nine's really late. we are really early. 
speaker2: damn, this better be important.
speaker3: federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond and agent sam stanley. sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see teresa banks' trailer, please.
speaker2: more popular than uncle's day at a whorehouse.

speaker1: did she have someone with her? 
speaker2: right. she had a friend with her. the friend took off.
speaker1: was there an argument?
speaker2: not that i know of. but arguments do happen, don't they?
speaker1: yes they do. did she have visitors?
speaker2: no, hey, i already told this whole thing to sheriff "not-quite-able"... here's the trailer now. he swings open the door. carl and this is exactly the way she left it. i never touched a thing.

speaker1: she lived alone. 
speaker2: she must have known someone.
speaker1: i'll get my kit.

speaker1: take a look at this. 
speaker2: she's wearing a ring.
speaker1: my guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
speaker2: may i see the magnifying glass, agent desmond? there doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
speaker3: i'm gonna make myself some good morning america. you want some?

speaker1: you weren't kiddin'. this stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend. 
speaker2: that's right. that's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
speaker3: we really do need a good "wake me up", don't we, agent desmond? we really do need a good "wake me up", don't we, agent desmond?
speaker1: did you know teresa banks?
speaker4: hey, how's j. edgar doin'? bet you appreciate them bustin' your mornin' in half, eh, carl? bet they woke you up.
speaker2: they're only doing their job.
speaker1: what are you doing here in the trailer court, deputy?
speaker4: maybe i just live here, what do you think about that?
speaker1: can i ask you where you were the night teresa banks was murdered?
speaker4: you can tell j. edgar that i was at a party and i got fifteen witnesses.
speaker2: maybe if you did a little less partyin' that little girl would still be alive.
speaker4: is that right, mr. jack daniels?
speaker1: did you know teresa banks?
speaker4: got a couple of cups of coffee at hap's from her. that's it. by the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? i could ask you the same question.
speaker1: no you couldn't.

speaker1: is there a golf course around here? 
speaker2: not a lot around here, no. got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
speaker1: thanks for your help, carl. sorry we woke you up.
speaker2: that's alright. i was having a bad dream. i was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
speaker3: i couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that deputy cliff was the murderer. you did think that, didn't you, agent desmond?
speaker1: he's not the murderer. but he's a bozo.
speaker3: yes, he is like a clown.

speaker1: what the is that thing doing out there? you're not taking that body anywhere. 
speaker2: we're taking the body back to portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
speaker1: maybe not _a_ thing, but maybe _two_ things.
speaker2: teresa banks had a ring. any idea what happened to it?
speaker1: we got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
speaker2: sam, get the body and put it in the van. sheriff cable, where were you the night teresa banks was murdered?
speaker3: when he says, "discussion", how do you take that, agent desmond?
speaker2: i don't take it, sam. i give it.

speaker1: now, j. edgar, i'm going to take off my badge, here. do you mind? the only way you're going to get that body is over mine. 
speaker2: you try that you little monkey.
speaker3: i think i'll take off my badge as well.
speaker3: this one's comin' from j. edgar.
speaker3: who's next?

speaker1: take the van back to portland, stanley. i'm going to take one more look at the trailer park. 
speaker2: one thing that has been troubling me. that lamp at the diner. do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
speaker1: faulty wiring.
speaker2: esthetics are subjective, aren't they, agent desmond? i'm sam stanley. if you ever need me.
speaker1: thanks, sam, for the good work. you have a good eye for detail.
speaker2: we do notice things, don't we, agent desmond? are you going back to the trailer park for the blue rose?

speaker1: and that's deputy cliff's trailer over there. the red one. 
speaker2: right.
speaker1: i'll be in my trailer if you need me.

speaker1: i know you haven't changed your hair and i've seen that beautiful dress before, but i must say, diane, you look sensational today. 
speaker1: no, i am not trying to buy time. it's thursday and i know you have changed something in the room... and this time you've done very well... and i am going to tell you exactly what it is... in a moment... you have moved... got it! it's the clock, you've moved it 12 inches to the left. another triumph for the dashing agent cooper. and you, diane, now have to clean the coffee cup, get fresh ground coffee from sally and make a great pot of coffee. cooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join cole and albert.
speaker1: what is it, gordon?

speaker1: agent chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. he had me drive the van with the body back here. 
speaker2: anything else?
speaker1: did gordon show you a woman named lil?
speaker2: i'm up to speed, stanley.
speaker1: agent chet wouldn't tell me what the blue rose meant.
speaker2: and neither will i.
speaker1: oh, alright. you know, i liked agent desmond. he had his own m.o.
speaker1: i cracked the whiteman case with this.
speaker2: stanley, i heard all about it.
speaker1: no one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
speaker2: tell me about the letter.
speaker1: take a look at this. chet and i found it under teresa banks' ring fingernail.
speaker2: and no one found the ring?
speaker1: no, sir, we did not.
speaker1: i'm sam stanley, if you ever need me.
speaker3: i'm beginning to lose faith in the united states government and that includes the telephone system. don't you folks talk to one another. that's her trailer there and i haven't touched a thing. agent chet desmond come by a second time and asked too see deputy cliff howard's trailer ...which i showed him. i went back to my trailer... after that i never saw him again.
speaker2: thank you, carl.
speaker3: that's not the way to cliff's trailer. i told you.
speaker2: i am not going to cliff's trailer.
speaker3: well, where are you going?
speaker2: i am going over here.
speaker3: damn, you people are confusing.
speaker2: what was here, mr. rodd?
speaker3: a trailer was here. what the do you think?
speaker2: can you tell me who's trailer it was...
speaker3: an old woman and her grandson.
speaker2: can you tell me what their names were?
speaker3: chalfont. weird. chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. two chalfonts.
speaker2: is that agent desmond's vehicle?
speaker3: yep, it sure is.

speaker1: here's your key, mr. jeffries. i hope you enjoy your stay here at the palm deluxe. this is for you. the joven... ah... young lady... she left it. 
speaker2: 612 --- very nice.

speaker1: phillip? 
speaker2: phillip?

speaker1: i'm not going to talk about judy. keep judy out of this. 
speaker2: but...

speaker1: who do you think that is there? 
speaker2: suffered some bumps on the old noggin', eh, phil?

speaker1: i want to tell you everything, but i don't have a lot to go on. but i'll tell you one thing: judy is positive about this. 
speaker2: how interesting. i thought we were going to keep judy out of this.
speaker1: listen to me carefully. i saw one of their meetings. it was above a convenience store.
speaker2: who's meeting? where have you been?

speaker1: it was a dream. we live inside a dream. 
speaker2: and it's raining post toasties.
speaker1: they sat quietly for hours.

speaker1: we have descended from pure air. 
speaker2: going up and down. between the two worlds.
speaker3: light of new discoveries.
speaker4: why not be composed of materials and combinations of atoms?
speaker5: this is no accident.
speaker2: this is a formica table. green is its color.
speaker1: our world.
speaker2: with chrome. any everything will proceed cyclically.
speaker6: boneless.
speaker7: yes, find the middle place.

speaker1: fell a victim. 
speaker2: fire walk with me...
speaker3: fire walk with me.
speaker4: we see the red room.

speaker1: i followed. 
speaker1: the ring... ring...

speaker1: may? 1989? 
speaker2: staring at the calendar. it is 1989.

speaker1: just a minute, laura. 
speaker2: if i am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
speaker1: you didn't do your homework?
speaker2: noooo...
speaker1: okay, this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week. you remember the...
speaker2: don't tell me now. tell me right before the test. i won't be able to remember long enough.
speaker1: you graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
speaker2: thanks.
speaker1: james called me last night looking for you.
speaker2: when?
speaker1: the usual, 9:15.
speaker2: he probably wanted to drive over.
speaker1: were you with bobby? or are you two still fighting?
speaker2: no, and yes. i don't know what i'm going to do about bobby. i know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks i'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
speaker1: are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
speaker2: i don't know what to do.
speaker1: you know what your problem is? you're just too adorable...
speaker2: you know, i think you're right. i'm just too adorable.
speaker1: laura palmer, you're just too adorable.
speaker2: i'm just too adorable. i'm just too adorable.
speaker3: "laura... donna... laura... donna..."
speaker4: that's why you need a real man, babe, you're tough to handle.
speaker1: and you're the real man?

speaker1: james... 
speaker2: laura, i'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
speaker1: okay.

speaker1: laura, do you love me? 
speaker2: yes, i love you. i've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
speaker1: why? it does.
speaker2: no, it doesn't... just kiss me.
speaker1: it does matter. we're in love.
speaker2: james, you don't know what you are talking about. quit trying to hold on so tight. i'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
speaker1: you're not a turkey. a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
speaker2: gobble, gobble, gobble.
speaker1: don't ever leave, laura, ever. i'll never leave you.

speaker1: where were you for the last hour? i've been lookin' for you? 
speaker2: i was right behind you, but you're too to turn around. if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.

speaker1: get lost bobby. 
speaker2: oh, yeah? you'll be callin' soon and maybe i'm not gonna be there.
speaker1: oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
speaker2: love ya, babe.

speaker1: mom h. eileen motors out. donna are you going to see james tonight? 
speaker2: why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night?
speaker1: you're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see bobby, are you?
speaker2: maybe.
speaker1: oh laura.
speaker2: well, why not?
speaker1: because bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. he's a goon. james is the one. he loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
speaker2: yes, james is very sweet. why don't you get out your violin, donna?
speaker1: sweet? he's gorgeous.
speaker2: james is very sweet and very gorgeous.
speaker1: i wonder if mike could ever write a poem? both of them drift off. donna do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
speaker2: faster and faster. for a long time you wouldn't feel anything. then you would burst into fire... forever.
speaker1: maybe i better start our homework.
speaker2: okay, i suppose i should go home.
speaker1: call me.
speaker2: sure. what do you want me to call you?
speaker1: call me anything just don't call me late for dinner. they laugh.

speaker2: who would do that?
speaker1: bob.
speaker2: but bob isn't real.
speaker1: the pages are gone. that's real.
speaker2: maybe.
speaker1: bob is real. he's been "having" me since i was 12. stunned, harold doesn't know what to do. laura the diary was hidden too well. he's the only one who could know where it was. he's getting to know me, now. he's real he speaks to me.
speaker2: what does bob say?
speaker1: he wants to be me... or he will kill me.
speaker2: no... no...
speaker1: oh, yes... yes...

speaker1: she buries herself on his shoulder. 
speaker2: the trees... the trees... they break. laura you have to hide the diary, harold. you made me write it all down. he doesn't know about you. you'll be safe.
speaker2: you're not bob are you, harold? if you are, you can kill me right now. kill me right now, if you are.
speaker3: laura, no, i'm not. i'm not bob. poor laura. i wish i could help you.
speaker2: i hate him, i hate it. sometimes i love it. but now i'm afraid. i am so afraid.
speaker3: but you're strong laura... so much
speaker2: he's in love with a girl who's dead. it _is_ dangerous for you to have it. i'm sorry.
speaker3: i'm so sorry, laura.
speaker2: i don't know when i can come back. maybe never.

speaker1: you lied to me about those school books. i found them upstairs on your bed. 
speaker2: what were you doing in my room?
speaker1: i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet. now why did you lie to me? where did you go?
speaker2: i had to see bobby. i know you really don't like bobby, but there was a problem and i didn't think you would understand.
speaker1: oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. ever. you can tell me anything. i'll understand.
speaker2: i'm sorry, mom.
speaker1: now hurry, dinner's almost ready. your father says he's starving.

speaker1: hello, laura. hello sarah. where's my axe? "i'm hungry". 
speaker2: oh, leland.
speaker3: dad.
speaker1: hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter leland palmer.
speaker1: the norwegians are coming next week and i want you to learn to say what i just learned in norwegian. so you can talk to them. i want you to learn to say, "hello, my name is leland palmer".
speaker3: but my name isn't leland palmer.
speaker2: neither is mine. and can't we talk about something serious for a change.
speaker1: this is serious. mr. benjamin horne's got a delegation of norwegians coming in next week and i want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. sarah, you first.
speaker1: hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter leland palmer.
speaker2: hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter sarah palmer.
speaker1: good. we'll practice some more. laura, now you try it.

speaker1: hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter laura palmer. 
speaker2: all together now...

speaker1: friend of leo's, right? partyland? 
speaker2: if you can and drive the party starts right now.

speaker1: cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. do you honestly think cole's practice of word association works? 
speaker2: the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. the world is a hologram, albert.
speaker1: yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, cooper?
speaker2: albert.
speaker1: you said, "teresa banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
speaker2: yes. either right now or right when i thought of it. the name and memory of teresa banks is haunting me. lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. because it is only a feeling, i am powerless to stop it. and another thing, albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
speaker1: let's test it for the record. will the next victim be a man or a woman?
speaker2: a woman.
speaker1: what color hair will she have?
speaker2: blonde.
speaker1: tell me some other things about her.
speaker2: she's in high school. she's sexually active. she's on drugs. she's crying out for some help.
speaker1: you're describing half the high school girls in america. what is she doing right now?
speaker2: she is preparing a great abundance of food.

speaker1: shelly, would you give laura a quick hand with the "meals on wheels"? 
speaker2: i'm kind of busy, norma.
speaker1: you're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
speaker3: i changed my mind, i don't want any coffee, eddie.
speaker4: sorry, norma.
speaker5: shelly approaches sheepishly.
speaker2: can i give you a hand getting the dinners together?
speaker6: that's alright, shelly. i know you have better things to do.
speaker2: norma asked me to give you a hand.
speaker6: okay. you can help me carry them to the car.

speaker1: this would look nice on your wall. 
speaker2: he's looking for a book with pages torn out. he's walking towards the hiding place. he's moving under the fan now.

speaker1: shelly, you really can help me. i can't do the "meals on wheels" today. i just can't. 
speaker2: okay.
speaker2: laura just took off. she asked me to do the run today. should i do it?
speaker3: what's with that laura? yeah, sure, take a look around. there's no one here anyway.
speaker2: you're right. there's no one here.
speaker3: there's no one here.
speaker2: norma, are you alright?
speaker3: come back as soon as you can.
speaker2: if leo comes here, he won't believe that i am out doing the "meals on wheels".
speaker3: don't worry, shelly, i'll handle leo.

speaker1: kind of quiet. 
speaker2: she starts to cry.

speaker1: laura... 
speaker1: what... laura are you all right?
speaker2: i... lost my necklace... it must have fallen.
speaker2: oh, here it is.
speaker1: well, i'm glad you found it, darling.

speaker1: laura? 
speaker2: donna, are you my best friend?
speaker1: of course...
speaker1: what is it laura? what's wrong?
speaker2: i just want a friend. just one friend for just one minute...
speaker1: laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
speaker2: yes, that's what i want. thanks d.

speaker2: mom, take it easy.
speaker3: no, no... this can't be happening.
speaker2: mom, you're not having a nervous breakdown.

speaker1: someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. shelly, i know where everything in this house is. sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is. 
speaker2: lay off the bennies, leo.
speaker1: anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. to really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.
speaker3: he scrubs more. leo that's one thing you are going to learn, shelly, - how to clean. it takes scrubbing, shelly. there is no easy way.

speaker1: as if i didn't know. 
speaker2: i'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
speaker1: come off it, leo. i'm late for work...
speaker2: what did you say?
speaker2: shelly, i am not fooling around anymore. the first thing you've got to work on is a good attitude. that's the key. anybody will tell you that.
speaker2: don't even _think_ about going anywhere, shelly. i'm not finished with you. he answers the phone.
speaker2: what are you doing calling me here?... no way, you already owe me money... five thousand, to be exact.
speaker1: five thousand???

speaker1: you interested or not?

speaker2: gotta go, donna. i'll call you tomorrow. laura leaves the house. donna trails behind.

speaker1: when this kind of fire starts. it is very hard to put out. 
speaker2: margaret?
speaker1: the tender bows of innocence burn first and the wind rises - then all goodness is in jeopardy.

speaker1: let's go around the world, babe. 
speaker2: this isn't going to get you to walla- walla.
speaker1: you do go all the way, don't you, little girl?
speaker2: sooner or later.

speaker1: hey, jacques...
speaker2: no "jacques". i am the great went.
speaker1: i am the muffin.
speaker2: and what a muffin you have.
speaker2: i am as blank as a fart.
speaker1: hey, donna, chug-a-lug.
speaker2: oh, laura's friend. i am "the great went". jacques holds her head in his huge hands. jacques there is no tomorrow.
speaker3: the room starts to spin.

speaker1: you smell nice. 
speaker2: haven't seen you since i was thrown out of one eyed jacks.
speaker1: what else did we do together? oh, i remember... hey, you know what? it's been a year. she's been dead a year... she's been dead a year.
speaker3: the party twins. my high school sandwich. let's put some meat inside...
speaker1: she's been dead a year.
speaker3: who?
speaker1: teresa...
speaker2: teresa banks? yeah, a whole year.
speaker1: yeah, she was going to get rich... she was blackmailing somebody...
speaker3: that's right. she called me. she even asked me what your fathers looked like...
speaker2: what? she asked about my father?
speaker3: but it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. she said he looked just like a boxer. speaking of sandwiches... i think bobby was arranging something for you... speaking of arrangements... speaking of arrangements... why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? leo and i know that santy claus is coming to town... thursday.
speaker4: okay, jacques.
speaker2: "the great went".
speaker1: here we go again. like we're back at one eyed jacks.
speaker2: oh, it sure is.
speaker1: is that donna hayward?
speaker5: seeing donna.

speaker1: laura falls full of panic to donna. laura donna, what are you doing? 
speaker2: okay, i won't wear your stuff... why can't i wear your stuff?
speaker3: jacques, help me get her home. now!
speaker2: i won't wear your stuff. i promise.
speaker3: not you, donna, not you.

speaker1: i'll take over here. 
speaker2: you were cutting this deer like a sissy... sit down and watch while i do it. again. this year.

speaker1: works every year... 
speaker2: sure wouldn't work at my house. my wife couldn't take the wrapper of a twinkie.

speaker1: josie, i think we should go public. 
speaker2: that would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since andrew died.
speaker1: what are you afraid of? what people think?
speaker2: i don't want to offend the customs of your country.
speaker1: believe me, josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. for instance, i don't eat fish eyes.
speaker2: fish eyes?
speaker1: even if it offended someone, i wouldn't eat a fish eye.
speaker2: why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, harry?
speaker1: i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle. he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. and he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver. i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. splat! it just stuck up there and spread out. it was about the size of a half dollar. and that's why i don't ever eat fish eyes. he plays the guitar for josie. then stops. truman i'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way i feel. it's the custom thing i was thinking of. in america we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. we throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
speaker2: i understand.
speaker1: we throw away the _whole_ head.

speaker1: i can't remember anything about last night. is there something i should remember? 
speaker2: no, you should forget about last night.
speaker1: laura, i am your friend.
speaker2: i know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
speaker1: you're not mad at me?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: i feel so bad. i had nightmares all night long. they all knew you at that place.
speaker2: what can i tell you?
speaker1: how did the car get back here?
speaker2: we got it back, that's all.
speaker1: how did i get in the house? how did i get into my bed?
speaker2: i can't help you there.
speaker1: was i wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
speaker2: all my things have me in them. i don't want you to be like me.
speaker1: but i love you, laura.
speaker2: and i love you, too. but don't wear my stuff.
speaker1: why do you do it, laura?
speaker2: cause i like it.

speaker1: excuse me, honey... laura turns to him with a start. leland we're late to meet mom for breakfast. 
speaker2: catch you later.

speaker1: dad, is the engine on fire? something is burning. leland turns and gives her a look. 
speaker2: it's the engine.
speaker3: you stole the corn. i had it canned above the store.
speaker3: the thread will be torn, mr. palmer, the thread will be torn.
speaker1: dad!... what was that all about? who was that?
speaker4: mr., mr., you shouldn't do that to your engine. you ought to take it easy, mr., you're going to burn your engine out.
speaker2: what the was all that? why doesn't someone do something about all of this. my that guy came out of nowhere. he was harassing my daughter.
speaker1: dad, are you all right?

speaker1: she is talking on the phone. 
speaker2: that sounds like fun... where did you see my picture?... okay, come to the blue diamond city motel... yes, that's just your side of blue diamond city... i'll be there. room one two three... right, as in "get ready".
speaker3: on top of teresa in bed. all whispers.

speaker3: soon. how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
speaker2: i can arrange that. i like that.

speaker3: who am i?
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker3: that's right.
speaker4: dad... dad... who was that? how do you know him? he looked familiar. have i met him?
speaker3: no, you haven't met him. have you met him?
speaker4: no.
speaker3: we're late to get to your mother.
speaker4: just sit here for a moment. you seem very upset.
speaker3: guy just pulls up out of the blue... i mean... what is this world coming to?
speaker2: what's wrong?
speaker3: nothing, i chickened out.

speaker1: are you sure you're okay? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: dad?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: did you come home during the day last week?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: oh, i thought i saw you.
speaker2: you know, i did come home, come to think of it, on thursday. i had a severe headache and i was driving in the neighborhood so i just darted in and out of the house. where were you, laura? i didn't see you?
