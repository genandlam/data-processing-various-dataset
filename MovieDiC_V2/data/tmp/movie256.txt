HANNA: remove the and scrotum, make a deep, circular cut around the rectum.

ERIK: german.

HANNA: in german w/ english

SUBTITLES): did you really want me to snap your neck?
ERIK: how much did you pull off the deer?
HANNA: a hundred and twenty with scraps.
ERIK: about 200 pounds in total?
ERIK: that explains it.
HANNA: what?
ERIK: how you beat me. you're getting strong. hanna almost blushes.

ERIK: the great blue whale is the largest animal to have ever existed. a blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons and its mouth is large enough to hold 90 tons of food and water. 
HANNA: how much is that?
ERIK: it's bigger than the cabin. its heart weighs thirteen hundred pounds and a male has seven gallons of testicles.
ERIK: the blue whale's "music" can be heard for over 500 miles.
ERIK: time for sleep.
HANNA: good night.
ERIK: did you forget something?
HANNA: no.
HANNA: sorry.
ERIK: good night.

HANNA: what's music like? 
ERIK: it's difficult to explain.
HANNA: try.
ERIK: ã¢â€â˜music. a combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion'.
HANNA: but how does it feel?
ERIK: good. it feels good. it's, uh, nice.
HANNA: tell me properly. can you play music?
ERIK: your mother could. she used to sing very well.

ERIK: just go to sleep now. i'll see you in the morning.

ERIK: again. 
ERIK: again.

HANNA: i'm ready now. 
ERIK: maybe.
ERIK: you didn't tell me you had a knife.
HANNA: you told me to think for myself. isn't that what you want?
HANNA: i want to see things. i can't stay here forever.

ERIK: one, two, three, four... 
ERIK: ...five, six, seven, eight...

HANNA: did you see it? wasn't it beautiful, like thunder. i had to stick my fingers in my ears it was so loud. did you hear it? 
HANNA: what's wrong?
HANNA: what does it do?
ERIK: it tells marissa wiegler where we are.
ERIK: when you want to leave here all you have to do is flip that switch.

ERIK: but once it's done, there'll be no going back. she'll never give up until you're dead, or she is. you understand? i wont be there to hold your hand. so be sure. be sure it's what you really want. 
HANNA: you're not scaring me. he looks at her disbelievingly.
ERIK: it's here. there's no rush. take your time.

ERIK: laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of moscow, was the first animal to orbit the earth. she was launched into outer space on the third of november, 1957. scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions. her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and laika had always been intended to die. 
HANNA: that's sad.
ERIK: when a star collapses the supernova explosion is 10 billion times brighter than other stars.

ERIK: will you hunt with me? 
HANNA: if you want.
ERIK: it's up to you.
HANNA: me?

HANNA: i'll stay.
ERIK: fine. erik leaves abruptly.

ERIK: you were lucky to grab that deer. there was nothing out there today. 
ERIK: smells good.

MARISSA: not a team player. not a ã¢â€âœjoiner.ã¢â€â he became increasingly isolated and disturbed. kept mouthing off about classified programmes.

MARISSA: what is it? 
LEWIS: ma'am, this is lewis.
MARISSA: go ahead.
LEWIS: the target escaped.
MARISSA: how did that happen?

LEWIS: we're thinking maybe he got away in the snow, in the thick snow, or... but he's in the wind and i have two men down. 
MARISSA: find him, lewis. find him and take him out.
LEWIS: ma'am. there's more. they found a child, his daughter.

HANNA: camera obscura, it's latin for "dark chamber".

LEWIS: plug the cctv through to langley. extension 247. 
LEWIS: you should have visual on the psych evaluation now.

MARISSA: what's she saying?
LEWIS: gobbledygook.

HANNA: i want to speak to marissa wiegler. 
LEWIS: did you hear that?
MARISSA: tell her i'll be there tonight.

LEWIS: but... 
MARISSA: just do it.

MILITARY DOCTOR 1: john come and take a look at this kid's blood sample. 
MILITARY DOCTOR 2.: is that right? that can't be right.

RACHEL: sophie just - i'll handle this.
RACHEL: where's your father?
RACHEL: i really think it might help if you told us the, you know, the truth and all that. have you run away from somewhere?
SOPHIE: are you okay?
HANNA: i'm fine.
RACHEL: i'm worried about you.
SOPHIE: she said she's fine.
RACHEL: you have to understand this really is a problem for us.

SOPHIE: you know what? why don't i stay here with her and you go off and be with dad? he's looking kind of tense. 
SEB: has she even got a passport?!

SOPHIE: of course you are. you've got pretty eyes and you're tall. i always wanted to be tall. if i were a man i might fancy you.
HANNA: i'm not a man. sophie laughs even more.

SEB: okay, here's the deal. we're going to find a way to get you home just as soon as we get off this crate. but since you don't have a passport with you right now, we're just going to have to be a bit gorilla. 
RACHEL: we passionately believe it's the right thing to do.

MARISSA: how much does he know about the programme?

ISAACS: everything. he knew johanna. 
MARISSA: what does he know about the child?
ISAACS: he also thinks erik's the father.

HANNA: what's that?
ERIK: it was a secret cia research programme in rural poland.

ERIK: this is what you were looking for.
ERIK: i recruited your mother at an abortion clinic in may 1994. she was about to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. some boy at a disco.
ERIK: i had recruited twenty women. she was the last. she was different. two years later i heard the programme was to be terminated. the research ã¢â€âœdisposed ofã¢â€â.
HANNA: disposed of?
ERIK: i tried to save all of you. but you were the only one i was able to rescue.

ERIK: hanna listen to me. 
HANNA: keep away from me.
ERIK: it worked. you worked.

ERIK: so go ahead. 
MARISSA: you know i'll find her.

MARISSA: what we created, together.

ISAACS: they had a fight. 
MARISSA: she must know the truth.
ISAACS: where do you think she's gone?
MARISSA: where would you go?
MARISSA: i'm closing the cia operation down. heller is dead, that's all that matters to them. this we do alone.

HANNA: i am looking for a train to galinka. 
GUARD: galinka is a small village. no trains. you must wait for bus in the morning.
HANNA: where can i stay?

HANNA: do you have a sandwich?

MARISSA: oh dear, what's wrong with you?
HANNA: sorry.
MARISSA: it's okay. are you in trouble? hanna nods. she fights the tears.
MARISSA: what sort of trouble?
HANNA: i don't know what to do. nothing is what i thought it would be. it's... ugly and cruel and i don't know where to go, or... i'm stupid. i don't know what i expected... marissa secretly, genuinely affected by this. fights the emotion that has surprised her. human warmth.
MARISSA: sometimes i feel the same way.

HANNA: i like music. 
MARISSA: sleep why don't you? you look very tired. it will take half an hour on this road.

HANNA: where are we?

HANNA: you're marissa wiegler. hanna starts to shake. 
MARISSA: don't worry sweetie. i don't want to hurt you.

MARISSA: i could have killed you already when you were asleep in the car. hanna's still shaking. 
MARISSA: did erik tell you about this place?
HANNA: where are the other children?
MARISSA: sleeping. they're all sleeping.
HANNA: i don't believe you.
MARISSA: i can protect you, hanna. make sure you walk out of here and keep walking. grow up and grow old in safety and security. no one need know a thing. but you have to trust me. you can't talk about this with anyone. it's what we call ã¢â€âœclassified.ã¢â€â if you tell anyone, it'll be dangerous for both of us.
HANNA: you killed my mother.
MARISSA: you're mother didn't want you, sweetie. i saved you.
MARISSA: i'm the only person left who understands who you are. the only one who cares.
MARISSA: i practically am your mother.

HANNA: no more. no more. 
HANNA: everything i see is nothing i want.
MARISSA: let me take care of you?
HANNA: no. i don't want that.
MARISSA: hanna.

HANNA: the earth is the third planet from the sun, and the fifth-largest of the eight planets in the solar system. 
HANNA: home to millions of species, including humans, earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist.
HANNA: the planet formed over four and a half billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface within a billion years.
HANNA: it is expected to continue supporting life for another one and a half billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the sun will eliminate it all.
