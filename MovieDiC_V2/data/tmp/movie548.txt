speaker1: ...john? john! get in here right now and clean up that pigsty of yours. 
speaker2: your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
speaker3: gimme that phillips right there.

speaker1: john! get your inside right now and do what your mother says! john pins todd with a defiant glare. 
speaker2: she's not my mother, todd!

speaker1: major moves, homes! so... where is your real mom, anyway? she dead or something? 
speaker2: she might as well be.

speaker1: 'morning, sarah. 
speaker2: good morning, dr. silberman. how's the knee?

speaker1: fine, sarah. 
speaker1: the delusional architecture is interesting. she believes a machine called a "terminator", which looks human of course, was sent back though time to kill her. and also that the father of her child was a soldier, sent to protect her... he was from the future too... the year 2029, if i remember correctly. let's move on, shall we?
speaker1: douglas, i don't like seeing the patients disturbing their rooms like this. see that she takes her thorazine, would you?

speaker1: time to take you meds, connor. 
speaker2: you take it.
speaker1: now you know you got to be good 'cause you up for review this afternoon...
speaker2: i'm not taking it. now i don't want any trouble...
speaker1: ain't no trouble at all --
speaker2: you... son of a... aaarrgh!!
speaker1: last call, sugar.

speaker1: easy money! 
speaker2: where'd you learn all this stuff?
speaker1: from my mom. my real mom, i mean. come on baby... let's go! they sprint around the corner to an --

speaker1: that her? 
speaker1: so she's pretty cool, huh?
speaker2: actually, no, she's a complete psycho. that's why she's up at pescedero. she tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
speaker1: no
speaker2: yeah, she's a total loser. c'mon, let's check out the 7-eleven, whatya say?

speaker1: are you the legal guardian of john connor? 
speaker2: that's right, officer. what's he done now?
speaker1: could i speak with him, please?
speaker2: well, you could if he was here. be he took off on his bike this morning. could be anywhere. you gonna tell me what his is about?
speaker1: i just need to ask him a few questions.
speaker3: there was a guy here this morning asking about him, too.
speaker2: yeah, big guy. on a bike. has that got something to do with it?
speaker1: i wouldn't worry. do you have a photograph of john?
speaker2: get the album, janelle.

speaker1: kyle..? you're dead. 
speaker2: i know. this is a dream, sarah.
speaker1: oh. yeah. they... make me take this stuff...
speaker1: hold me.
speaker2: i love you. i always will.
speaker1: oh, kyle. i need you so much.
speaker2: where's john, sarah?
speaker1: they took him from me.
speaker2: it's john who's the target now. you have to protect him. he's wide open.
speaker1: i know!
speaker2: don't quit, sarah. our son need you.
speaker2: remember the message... the future is not set. there is not fate but what we make for ourselves. he turns toward the door.
speaker1: kyle, don't go!

speaker1: ... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow i can still see. look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do i have to -- 
speaker2: please continue...
speaker2: dreams about cataclysm, or the end of the world, are very common, sarah...
speaker1: it's not just a dream. it's real, you i know the date is happens!!
speaker2: i'm sure it feels very real to you --
speaker1: on august 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty real to you, too! anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
speaker2: relax now, sarah --
speaker1: you think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead. everybody, you, him... everybody... you're all dead!
speaker1: you're the one living in a dream, silberman, not me! because i know it happens. it happens!
speaker3: i was afraid... and confused. i feel much better, now. clearer. silberman gives a calculated paternal smile.
speaker4: yes. your attitude have been very positive lately. sarah looks up at him. her voice is hopeful.
speaker3: it has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
speaker4: and what it that?
speaker3: you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months. well, it's been six months, and i was looking forward to seeing my son.
speaker4: i see. let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines. now you think they don't exist? close on sarah. her voice sounds hollow.
speaker3: they don't exist. i see that now.
speaker4: but you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
speaker3: if i had, there would have been some evidence. they would have found something at the factory.
speaker4: i see. so you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up? sarah shakes her head no.

speaker1: greetings, troops. 
speaker2: mr. dyson? the material teams wants to run another test on the uh... on it.
speaker1: yup. come on. i'll get it.
speaker2: listen, mr. dyson, i know i haven't been here that long, but i was wondering if you could tell me... i mean, if you know...
speaker1: know what?
speaker2: well... where it came from.
speaker1: i asked them that question once. know what they told me? don't ask.

speaker1: so what do you think, doctor? i've shown a lot of improvement, haven't i? 
speaker2: you see, sarah... here's the problem. i know how smart you are, and i think you're just telling me what i want to hear. i don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
speaker1: you have to let me see my son. please. it's very important. he's in danger. at least let me call him -- silberman pins her with his sweet reptilian gaze.
speaker2: i'm afraid not. not for a while. i don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board that you stay here another six months.

speaker1: goddammit. let me go!! silberman! you don't 
speaker2: model citizen.

speaker1: now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right? 
speaker2: yes. cyberdyne systems, model 101.
speaker1: no way!
speaker1: holy you're really real! i mean... whoah!
speaker2: i'm a cybernetic organism. living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
speaker1: this in intense. get a grip, john. okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... i figured that part out for myself. so what's the deal?
speaker2: my mission is to protect you.
speaker1: yeah? who sent you?
speaker2: you did. thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time. john gives him an amazed look.
speaker1: this is deep.

speaker1: so this other guy? he's a terminator too, right, like you? 
speaker2: not like me. a t-1000. advanced prototype. a mimetic polyalloy.
speaker1: what does that mean?
speaker2: liquid metal.
speaker1: radical.
speaker2: you are targeted for termination. the t-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. ever. john mulls that over.
speaker1: where we going?
speaker2: we have to leave the city, immediately. and avoid the authorities.
speaker1: can i stop by my house?
speaker2: negative. the t-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
speaker1: you sure?
speaker2: i would.

speaker1: hello? 
speaker2: janelle? it's me.
speaker1: john? where are you, honey? it's late. you should come home, dear. i'm making a casserole.
speaker3: what the hell's the dog barking at?

speaker1: the dog's really barking. maybe it's already there. what should i do? 
speaker2: john? john, are you okay?
speaker3: i'm right here. i'm fine. what's the dog's name?
speaker1: max.
speaker3: hey, janelle, what's wrong with wolfy? i can hear him barking. is he okay?
speaker3: your foster parents are dead. let's go.

speaker1: i need a minute here, okay? you're telling me it can imitate anything it touches? 
speaker2: anything it samples by physical contact.
speaker1: like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
speaker2: no. only an object of equal size.
speaker1: well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
speaker2: it can't form complex machines. guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts. it doesn't work that way. but it can form solid metal shapes.

speaker1: we spent a lot of time in nicaragua... places like that. for a while she was with this crazy ex-green beret guy, running guns. then there were some other guys. she'd shack up with anybody she could learn from. so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader. then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho. didn't you know? it's like... everything i'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? i hated her for that. but everything she said was true. we gotta get her out of there. 
speaker2: negative. the t-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
speaker1: oh, great. and what happens to her?
speaker2: typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
speaker1: terminated!? why didn't you tell me? we gotta right now!
speaker2: negative. she is not a mission priority.
speaker1: yeah, well you, she's a priority to me!
speaker1: hey, goddammit! what's your problem?
speaker1: help! help!! i'm being kidnapped! get this psycho off of me!
speaker1: let go of me!!
speaker1: oww! why'd you do that?
speaker2: you told me to.
speaker1: you have to do what i say?!
speaker2: that is one of my mission parameters.
speaker1: prove it... stand on one foot. terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg.
speaker1: cool! my own terminator. this is great!
speaker3: hey, kid. you okay?
speaker1: take a hike, bozo.
speaker3: yeah? you, you little dipshit.
speaker1: dipshit? did you say dipshit?! grab this guy.
speaker1: now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?
speaker1: put the gun down! now!!
speaker1: walk away.
speaker1: jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
speaker2: of course. i'm a terminator.
speaker1: listen to me, very carefully, okay? you're not a terminator any more. alright? you got that? you can't just go around killing people!
speaker2: why?
speaker1: whattaya mean, why? 'cause you can't!
speaker2: why?
speaker1: you just can't, okay? trust me on this.
speaker1: look, i'm gonna go get my mom. you wanna come along, that's fine with me.

speaker1: he killed seventeen police officers that night. recognize him? 
speaker1: this one was taken by a japanese tourist today.
speaker2: ms. connor, you've been told that your son's missing. his foster parents have been murdered, and we know this guy's involved. talk to us. don't you care?
speaker1: we're wasting out time.
speaker3: sorry, gentleman...

speaker1: you have a sarah connor here? she assumes he's with the other cops. smiles. 
speaker2: running late, aren't you?
speaker2: your friends are on their way out now...
speaker3: lewis, see these gentleman out and them lock up for the night.
speaker2: whatcha got, lewis?
speaker4: just some trash.

speaker1: all set. 
speaker2: gotta check the gun first, lewis.
speaker1: yeah, sorry.

speaker1: you broke my arm! 
speaker2: there's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. that's one. now don't move! 68b moving rapidly, she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a syringe. they keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients. she jams it into the orderly's and fires the whole shot. still holding the empty syringe, she sees what she need next. they keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from drinking drano. she grabs a plastic jug of liquid plum'r and slams it down on the desk inches from silberman's eyes. she jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug. draws back the plunger. the syringe fills with blue liquid. she whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into silberman's neck. his horrified eyes rack toward it. 10 cc's of blue death fill the cylinder. her thumb hovers over the plunger. she jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him, then hauls him through the door. 69 in the corridor outside cell 19 the t-1000 stops and looks in the window. douglas, his face a mess, yells to be heard.
speaker3: open the door! the is loose in the halls!

speaker1: now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right? 
speaker2: right.
speaker1: swear.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: just say "i swear i won't kill anyone."
speaker2: i swear i will not kill anyone.
speaker2: he'll live.

speaker1: open it or he'll be dead before he hits the floor. 
speaker2: there's no way, connor. let him go.
speaker3: it won't work, sarah. you're no killer. i don't believe you'd do it. her voice is a deadly cold hiss.
speaker1: you're already dead, silberman. everybody here dies. you know i believe that. so don't with me!
speaker3: open the door!
speaker1: step back!
speaker1: he does. she faces both of them.
speaker1: down on the floor! now!
speaker3: get her!
speaker3: go around, goddamnit! go around!!
speaker4: mom!! wait!
speaker1: no! help me! goddamnit, it's gonna kill us all!!!
speaker4: mom, are you okay?
speaker5: come with me if you want to live.
speaker4: it's all right, mom. he's here to help.
speaker5: go! run!

speaker1: hang on. 
speaker1: drive.

speaker1: can you see anything? 
speaker2: everything.
speaker1: cool.
speaker3: you okay?
speaker1: i said i was okay.
speaker3: it was stupid of you to go there.
speaker3: goddamnit, john, you have to be smarter than that. you're too important! you can't risk yourself, not even for me, do you understand? i can take care of myself. i was doing fine. john. you almost got yourself killed.
speaker1: i... had to get you out of the place... i'm sorry, i...
speaker3: stop it! right now! you can't cry, john. other kids can afford to cry. you can't.
speaker2: what is wrong with your eyes?
speaker3: so what's your story?

speaker1: ... it was all true and we're all going to die and the changed, i saw him change!! it's quite pathetic. a nurse shoots him up with a sedative. they lead him away. 
speaker2: this t-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
speaker3: ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds. sarah thinks about that. then:
speaker2: can it be destroyed?
speaker3: unknown.
speaker2: pull in here. we have to ditch this car.

speaker1: you look like handmade 
speaker2: so do you.

speaker1: i have detailed files on human anatomy. 
speaker2: i'll bet. makes you a more efficient killer, right?
speaker1: correct.

speaker1: does it hurt? 
speaker2: i sense injuries. the data could be called pain.
speaker3: will these heal up?
speaker3: that's good. because if you can't pass for human, you won't be much good to us.
speaker1: how long do you live? i mean, last?
speaker2: a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
speaker1: can you learn? so you can be... you know. more human. not such a dork all the time. terminator turns towards him.
speaker2: my cpu is a neural-net processor... a learning computer. but skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
speaker3: doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: can we reset the switch?

speaker1: now open the port cover. 
speaker1: hold the cpu by its base tab. pull.

speaker1: can you see the pin switch? she ignores him. see looks at terminator. the back at the chip. 
speaker1: no!!!!
speaker2: out of the way, john!
speaker1: no! don't kill him!
speaker2: it, john. not him. it.
speaker1: alright, it! we need it!
speaker2: we're better off by ourselves.
speaker1: but it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
speaker2: i don't trust it! these things are hard to kill, john, believe me, i know. we may never have this opportunity again.
speaker1: look, mom, if i'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while. 'cause if you won't, nobody else will.
speaker3: was there a problem?
speaker1: no problem. none whatsoever.

speaker1: are we learning yet? 
speaker2: just head south.

speaker1: keep it under sixty-five. we can't afford to be pulled over. terminator backs off the throttle slightly. 
speaker2: affirmative.
speaker3: no, no, no. you gotta listen to the way people talk. see, you don't say like "affirmative" or some like that. you say... no problemo.
speaker3: it someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "hasta la vista, baby".
speaker2: "hasta la vista, baby"?
speaker3: yeah, or "later, dickwad." or if someone gets upset you say "chill out." like that. or you can do combinations.
speaker2: chill out,
speaker3: that's great! see, you're getting it.
speaker2: no problemo.

speaker1: you got any cash? 
speaker2: only a couple hundred bucks. i'll give you half.
speaker1: get some food.
speaker2: no sense of humor.
speaker2: and that's another thing. you could lighten up a bit, yourself. this severe routine is getting old. smile once in a while.
speaker3: smile?
speaker2: yeah. smile. you know. people smile, right? watch. goes to the order window.
speaker2: hi. nice place you got here. how's business?
speaker4: gimme a break.
speaker2: like that.
speaker2: i don't know, maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something.

speaker1: you're dead! 
speaker2: am not!
speaker1: are so!
speaker3: we're not gonna make it, are we? people, i mean.
speaker4: it is in your nature to destroy yourselves. john nods, depressed.
speaker3: yeah. drag, huh?
speaker5: i need to know how skynet get built. who's responsible?
speaker4: the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson, director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation.
speaker5: why him?
speaker4: in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
speaker5: then what?
speaker4: in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems. all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned, afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
speaker4: basically. the skynet funding bill is passed. the system goes on-line august 4th, 1997. human decisions are removed from strategic defense. skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate. it becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, august 29.
speaker5: and skynet fights back.
speaker4: yes. it launches its icbms against their targets in russia.
speaker5: why attack russia?
speaker4: because skynet knows the russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
speaker5: how much do you know about dyson?
speaker4: i have detailed files.
speaker5: i want to know everything. what he looks like. where he lives. everything.

speaker1: you going to work all day? 
speaker2: i'm sorry, baby. this thing is just kicking my ass. i thought we had it with this one...
speaker2: ... but the output went to after three seconds. i'm thinking now it's the way i'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
speaker1: you need a break. you'll see it clear when you come back.
speaker2: i can't
speaker1: miles, it's sunday. you promised to take the kids to raging waters today.
speaker2: oh. i can't, honey. i'm on a roll here.
speaker2: baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. it's a neural-net process --
speaker1: i know. you told me. it's a neural-net processor. it thinks and learns like we do. it's superconducting at room temperature. other computer are pocket calculators by comparison. but why is that so important, miles? i really need to know, 'cause i feel like i'm going crazy here, sometimes.
speaker2: i'm sorry, honey, it's just that i'm thiiis close.
speaker2: imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover. meet the pilot.
speaker1: why did you marry me, miles? why did we have these two children? you don't need us. your heart and your mind are in here. but it doesn't love you like we do.
speaker2: i'm sorry.
speaker1: how about spending some time with your other babies?

speaker1: enrique? you here? 
speaker2: you pretty jumpy, connor.
speaker2: oye, big john! que pasa? who's your very large friend?
speaker2: hmmm. uncle bob, huh? okay.
speaker3: uncle bob?
speaker2: honey, take pacolito. thanks, baby.
speaker2: drink?
speaker1: i just came for my stuff. and i need clothes, food, and one of your trucks.
speaker1: now, enrique. you two are on weapons detail.

speaker1: hook it on. 
speaker1: one thing about my mom... she always plans ahead.

speaker1: excellent. 
speaker2: yeah, i thought you'd like this place.

speaker1: this is the best truck, but the water pump is blown. you got the time to change it out? 
speaker2: yeah. i'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border. enrique, it's dangerous for you here. you get out tonight, too, okay?
speaker1: yeah, saralita. sure. just drop by any time and totally up my life. she slaps him on the shoulder.

speaker1: see, i grew up in places like this, so i just thought it was how people lived... riding around in helicopters. learning how to blow up. 
speaker1: then, when mom got busted i got put in a regular school. the other kids were, like, into nintendo.
speaker1: are you ever afraid?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: not even of dying?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: you don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
speaker2: no. i have to stay functional until my mission is complete. then it doesn't matter.
speaker1: yeah. i have to stay functional too. "i'm too important".
speaker1: it's definitely you.

speaker1: there was this one guy that was kinda cool. he taught me engines. hold this a second. mom screwed it up, of course. sooner or later she'd always tell them about judgment day and me being this world leader and that's be all she wrote. 
speaker2: torque wrench please.
speaker1: here. i wish i coulda met my real dad.
speaker2: you will.
speaker1: yeah. i guess so. my mom says when i'm, like, 45, i think, i send him back through time to 1984. but right now he hasn't even been born yet. man, is messes with your head. where's that other bolt? thanks. mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, i guess. i see her crying sometimes. she denies it totally, of course. like she says she got something in her eye.
speaker2: why do you cry?
speaker1: you mean people? i don't know. we just cry. you know. when it hurts.
speaker2: pain causes it?
speaker1: uh-unh, no, it's different... it's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. you get it?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: alriight!! my man!
speaker2: no problemo.
speaker3: watching john with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. the terminator would never stop, it would never leave him... it would always be there. and it would never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it couldn't spend time with him because it was too busy. and it would die to protect him. of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up. in an insane world, it was the sanest choice.

speaker1: she said you go south with him... ... tonight, like you planned. she will meet you tomorrow in... but john is moving, running after her. 
speaker2: mommm!! wait!!

speaker1: "no fate." no fate but what we make. my father told her this... i mean i made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- never mind. okay, the whole thing goes "the future is not set. there is no fate but what we make for ourselves." 
speaker2: she intends to change the future somehow.
speaker1: i guess, yeah -- oh
speaker2: dyson.
speaker1: yeah, gotta be! miles dyson! she's gonna blow him away! john motions to terminator and breaks into a run.
speaker1: come on. let's go. let's go!!

speaker1: this is tactically dangerous. 
speaker2: drive faster.
speaker1: the t-1000 has the same files that i do. it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson's house.
speaker2: i don't care. we've gotta stop her.
speaker1: killing dyson might actually prevent the war.
speaker2: i don't care!! there's gotta be another way. haven't you learned anything?! haven't you figured out why you can't kill people? terminator is still stumped.
speaker2: look, maybe you don't care if you live or die. but everybody's not like that! okay?! we have feelings. we hurt. we're afraid. you gotta learn this stuff, man, i'm not kidding. it's important.

speaker1: run, kids! go! run! 
speaker2: miles! oh my
speaker3: stay back!!

speaker1: danny! danny! 
speaker2: daaaaddddeeee!
speaker3: don't move! don't move!! get on the floor, now!! down!

speaker1: don't hurt my father! 
speaker2: please... let... the kids... go...
speaker3: shut up! shut up!! it's all your fault! it's your fault!!
speaker4: mom? you okay?
speaker3: i couldn't... oh, you... came here... to stop me?
speaker4: uh huh.
speaker4: it's okay. it'll by okay. we'll figure it out.
speaker3: i love you, john. i always have.
speaker4: i know, mom. i know.
speaker5: clean penetration. no shattered bone. compression should control the loss of blood.
speaker5: do you have bandages?
speaker2: in the bathroom. danny, can you get them for us? danny nods and runs down the hall.
speaker2: who are you people?
speaker4: show him.
speaker2: my
speaker5: now listen to me very carefully.

speaker1: dyson listened while the terminator laid it all down. skynet. judgment day... the history of things to come. it's not every day you find out you're responsible for 3 billion deaths. he took it pretty well, considering... terminator finishes speaking. 
speaker2: i feel like i'm gonna throw up.
speaker2: you're judging me on thing's i haven't even done yet. how were we supposed to know?
speaker1: yeah. right. how were you supposed to know?
speaker3: mom, mom, we need to be more constructive here. i don't see this as a gender-related issue. she's still tense. we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening. right?
speaker4: but i thought... aren't we changing things? i mean... right now? changing the way it goes?
speaker2: that's right! there's no way i'm going to finish the new processor now. forget it. i'm out of it. i'm quitting cyberdyne tomorrow...
speaker1: that's not good enough.
speaker2: look, whatever you want me to do, i'll do. i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
speaker5: no one must follow your work.

speaker1: do you know about the chip? 
speaker2: what chip?
speaker1: they have it in a vault at cyberdyne... it's gotta be from the other one like you.
speaker3: the cpu from the first terminator.
speaker2: son of a i knew it!
speaker1: they told us not to ask where they got it. i thought... japan... hell, i don't know. i didn't want to know.
speaker2: those lying motherfuckers!
speaker1: i was scary stuff, radically advanced. it was shattered... didn't work. but it gave us ideas, it took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of. all this work is based on it.
speaker3: i must be destroyed.
speaker2: can you get us in there, past security?
speaker1: i think so, yeah. when?
speaker1: now? yeah, right.
speaker4: miles, i'm scared. okay. but the only thing that scares me more than you going... is you not going. he nods. she's right.
speaker2: is it safe for them here?

speaker1: silent alarm's been tripped. it neutralizes the codes throughout the building. nothing'll open now. we see his nerve snapping.
speaker1: we should abort.
speaker2: no!! we're going all the way! you got that, dyson?

speaker1: you guys get started on the lab... i can open this.

speaker1: yeah, all that stuff! and all the disks in those offices. especially my office... everything in my office! these, too! this is important. 
speaker1: and all this here... that's it.

speaker1: we don't have much time.

speaker2: come on! let's go!

speaker1: john? john? can you hear me? where are you? 208a he crawls out of the shadows. 
speaker1: help me, honey...
speaker1: john, get out of the way!!

speaker1: i need a vacation. 
speaker2: is it dead?
speaker1: terminated.
speaker2: will it melt in there?
speaker1: yes. throw it in.
speaker1: he does. it sinks into the lava. vanishes.
speaker1: and the chip.
speaker3: it's finally over.
speaker1: no. there is another chip.
speaker1: and it must be destroyed also. john suddenly understands what he means.
speaker2: no!
speaker1: i'm sorry, john.
speaker2: no, no no!! it'll be okay. stay with us!
speaker1: i have to go away, john.
speaker2: don't do it. please... don't go -- tears are streaming down his face. tight closeup terminator, turning toward john.
speaker1: it must end here... or i am the future.
speaker2: i order you not to!
speaker1: i know now why you cry. but it is something i can never do. goodbye.
speaker3: are you afraid?
speaker1: yes.

speaker1: july 11, 2029 
speaker2: august 29th 1997 came and went. nothing much happened. michael jackson turned forty. there was no judgment day. people went to work as they always do, laughed, complained, watched tv, made love.
speaker2: i wanted to run down the street yelling... to grab them all and say "every day form this day is a gift. use it well!" instead i got drunk.
speaker2: that was thirty years ago. but the dark future which never came still exists for me, and it always will, like the traces of a dream lingering in the morning light. and the war against the machines goes on. or, to be more precise, the war against those who build the wrong machines.
speaker2: john fights the war differently than it was foretold. here, on the battlefield of the senate, the weapons are common sense... and hope.
speaker3: tie me, grandma.
speaker2: the luxury of hope was given to me by the terminator. because if a machine can learn the value of human life... maybe we can too.
