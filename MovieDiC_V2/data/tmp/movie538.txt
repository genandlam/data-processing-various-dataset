speaker1: working script for

speaker1: read 
speaker2: "they eyes of broadway"

speaker1: aw lady, if i looked like you, i'd-- 
speaker2: c'mon...c'mon...
speaker1: keep ya sweatshirt on, sidney.
speaker1: hey, fresh, the globe just came in -- hey, sidney, want an item for hunsecker's column? two rolls get fresh with a baker! hey, hot, hot, hot -- etc.

speaker1: publicity 
speaker2: just a minute, mr. weldon. i think...
speaker2: i'm sorry. i thought that was mr. falco returning. yes, i'll tell him when he comes in. i know he's been trying to reach you.
speaker2: that's the third time he's called today.
speaker3: he wants me to break a leg?
speaker2: no, an arm, he said. i told him you were sure the item would be in mr. hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
speaker3: it isn't. i've just seen the early edition.
speaker2: but...
speaker3: but what?
speaker2: that makes five days in a row that mr. hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
speaker3: may i rent you out as an adding machine.
speaker3: get me joe robard.
speaker3: who else phoned?
speaker2: the renting agent and the tailor.
speaker3: pay the rent. let the tailor wait.
speaker2: it won't leave much of a balance in the bank... mr. robard? could you locate him?
speaker3: sidney, joe. how do you like it? i'm running out of alibis! no, i asked hunsecker to withhold the item, until he could give it a fine, fat paragraph. the column was running over and i didn't want you kissed off with just a line...

speaker1: of course. what is this, sidney, a kissing game? you're a liar - that's a publicity man's nature. i wouldn't hire you if you wasn't a liar. i pay you a c-and-a-half a week wherein you plant big lies about me and the club all over the map. yeah, i mean in that sense. but also in the sense that you are a personal liar, too, because you don't do the work i pay you for. oh, stop it, sidney. you're from the country, not me. 
speaker2: sally is watching him, unhappy on his behalf.
speaker3: now, wait a minute, joe. when i saw j.j. last night he said... but robard has cut off. sidney hangs up. a silence. sally tries to be comforting.
speaker4: i wish i could help in some way, sidney.
speaker3: help me with two minutes of silence!
speaker3: go home, sally. it's late...
speaker4: i hate to see you like this --
speaker3: yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books. and if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
speaker4: sidney, i know you by now. don't do a dance with me...
speaker3: you mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
speaker4: sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
speaker3: so what'll you do if i feel nervous? you'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
speaker4: sid...you got me so...i don't know what... she is crying. sidney feels uncomfortable. not too generously, he relents:
speaker3: you ought to be used to me by now.
speaker4: i'm used to you...
speaker3: no. you think i'm a hero. i'm no hero. i'm nice to people where it pays me to be. i gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office. i'm in a bind right now with hunsecker so -- every dog has his day! lock up and leave the key.
speaker3: if that's for me, tear it up!
speaker4: take a top coat.
speaker3: and leave a tip in every hat-check room in town? he is already gone as she picks up the phone.
speaker4: sidney falco office... oh, miss kay, he tried to reach you. no, he's at the barbers now. no, that's held over till the tuesday column...

speaker1: don't you ever get messages, eyelashes? i called you twice. 
speaker2: i've been up to here. listen, honey, tell me something. you know susan hunsecker...? has she been in? i mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
speaker1: i don't think so.
speaker2: you're sure. find out for me.
speaker2: is frank d'angelo around?
speaker1: at the bar - sidney...

speaker1: that's a lollipop that, boy. the kid is only great. 
speaker2: and with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, frank.
speaker1: went over to philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
speaker2: see my mother?
speaker1: i only had a few hours.
speaker1: thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
speaker2: robard's my client. i did it for him and his club, not your boys. frank again notes sidney's resentful manner. sidney looks towards the musicians.
speaker2: frank, i think maybe you lied to me.
speaker1: looka, sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
speaker2: you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker, didn't you?
speaker1: yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge. and, frankly, i'm glad. for steve's sake, i'm glad, not yours. i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart. steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
speaker2: you told him that?
speaker1: not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
speaker2: when do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
speaker1: coupla weeks. for eight weeks.
speaker2: that's a nice tour. all booked? when was susie around here last?
speaker1: four five nights ago. that's how i know the romance is off. also steve's in a very bad mood.
speaker2: listen, frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
speaker1: i don't like this threatening attitude. when it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...

speaker1: if you knew hunsecker as well as i did, you might understand why it's my business. maybe you're walking around blind, frank, without a cane. 
speaker1: ...and in case you didn't know it, susie hunsecker's out there on the back step right now.
speaker2: he looks disturbed.

speaker1: hi! susie... 
speaker2: hello, chico. paul.
speaker2: full house...?
speaker3: packin' 'em in.

speaker1: well, we just sort of got together. maybe if you ask mr. katz...he writes the stuff, you know. 
speaker2: huh?

speaker1: chico, smiling, explains: 
speaker2: don't waste your time there, man. you've got something better waiting outside... susie's out there.
speaker3: his reaction betrays some emotion. steve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard, then hesitates - almost as if he was afraid to go out. he meets chico's eye again.
speaker3: what did she say...?
speaker2: he is amused, but sympathetic.
speaker2: you proposed to her, not me. go get your answer...

speaker1: hi, fellows. where's the chief? 
speaker2: who?
speaker1: dallas. is he around?
speaker3: yeah, he's around somewhere.
speaker1: thanks.

speaker1: this is big, you know. very big! let's go out later, drink some firewater. with the boys. fred can call millie and - 
speaker2: steve, i'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until i tell my brother...

speaker1: he isn't going to like it. 
speaker1: you sure you don't want me to be with you...?
speaker2: steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted. he isn't perfect, but -
speaker1: but he isn't going to like this, susie. and he makes you nervous, not me. no, i take that back - he makes me nervous, too. but i wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
speaker2: let's forget him and -
speaker1: his stooge, falco, is around - i saw him walk in. he's been spying on me for weeks, susie.
speaker2: darling, i don't care - really i don't. sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
speaker1: but he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
speaker2: steve, dear, please forget all of this. what can it matter after tomorrow?
speaker1: i have a message for you; i love you. may i dedicate the next number to you?...and the next, and the next. every sunday i'll buy you a new bonnet -
speaker2: if the stores are open -
speaker1: and on monday, i'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
speaker2: and on tuesday - hasenpfeffer.
speaker1: how do you think i realized i love you?
speaker2: i made you write a beautiful song...
speaker1: no, you had me eating that chinese food!...
speaker3: can more than two enjoy this joke... hello, susie, i didn't expect to find you here.
speaker3: where's those glossy prints you promised? tonight's the latest i can place them -
speaker1: well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it. it's cold out here, susie. steve makes a move to lead susan back inside. it is a gesture which appears to dismiss sidney. sidney chooses to take umbrage:
speaker3: let me apologize for getting you that press spread. it's been an honor to serve you gratis.
speaker1: i get the feeling, falco, that you're always snooping around...
speaker2: steve, stop it please...

speaker1: what are you boys fighting about? 
speaker2: kill me! find me a door somewhere - i walked in without knocking! sidney is trying to needle steve; steve's temper would normally have exploded; but now he controls it.
speaker3: i'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what i said - i said you snoop. for instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
speaker2: begging your pardon, i haven't been down the bowery in years!
speaker1: come on boys, break it up...
speaker3: the next time you want information, falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!

speaker1: if you're going home, susie, i'll drop you off... 
speaker2: time for the next set, chief...
speaker3: just a minute, chico.

speaker1: don't tell me you started a polka with leo bartha? 
speaker2: he came in last week on a very dull rainy night. i know who he was, but i didn't let on. he didn't take his eyes off me all night. listening...? rita has mistaken sidney's shrewdly calculating expression for inattention.
speaker1: avidly. he was staring.
speaker2: staring. consequently, when he approached me on his way out i wasn't surprised, but i didn't let on.
speaker1: he was writing a special sunday piece on...?
speaker2: ...cigarette girls... and naturally -
speaker1: you were thrilled to be interviewed. were you "interviewed"?
speaker2: in his apartment -
speaker1: and where was his wife?
speaker2: i don't know - it's a big apartment. but i wasn't interviewed. in fact, i was totally unprepared for what happened.
speaker1: we're old friends, chickie - quit it! a big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter! what did you think would happen in his house?
speaker2: but, sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
speaker2: for a moment i was so taken aback that i said anything that popped into my sleepy head. if i'm not mistaken, i even ordered the man out of his own house.

speaker1: he was furious and, by the time i could have put on a tropical island mood, i was out on the street!... that night mr. van cleve calls me into his office here. he's got nothing against me, he says but he can't afford to antagonize columnists. i told him i still have sonny at military academy, but van cleve's made of ice... aware that sidney is moving to leave her so that he can catch susan, rita detains him with an appeal: 
speaker1: do you think you could do something, sidney?
speaker2: that's what i'm thinking, rita. maybe...
speaker1: do you still keep your key under the mat?

speaker1: frank, i don't want any secrets from you. i proposed to susie tonight. 
speaker2: did she accept?
speaker1: you don't like it, do you. i think she will accept, but i'm not sure. she may be too dependent on her brother.

speaker1: you're touchy, sidney - don't be so touchy... 
speaker2: i wasn't looking for a brawl. i came to bring him a present. wanna bite to eat? susan shakes her head. she looks up as she hears the doorman's whistle off screen. sidney moves forward to her to the taxi.

speaker1: feels like a monday night, don't it...? 
speaker2: not to me. sometimes, the world feels like a cage. then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never monday night again... i wish you and steve could like each other.
speaker1: we stick in each others craw.
speaker2: yes, but why?
speaker1: well, for one thing, he thinks j.j.
speaker2: quizzically, she studies sidney.
speaker2: don't you?

speaker1: i know. but someday i'd like to look into your clever mind and see what you really think of him - 
speaker2: sidney makes a show of indignation.
speaker3: where do you come off to make a remark like that?
speaker1: do you think j.j. likes steve...?
speaker3: frankly, yes, to my surprise. he thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks. susan says nothing. sidney, watching her closely, probes further:
speaker3: wedding bells, you mean?
speaker1: he wants me to go on the road with them. it's an eight month tour, all the way to oregon...

speaker1: well, congratulations. but don't go just for the ride! or didn't you accept the proposal? 
speaker2: susan continues.
speaker3: i'm going to discuss it with j.j. in the morning.
speaker3: it's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because i'm my brother's sister.
speaker1: chickie, i'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
speaker3: i hope that j.j. really likes steve, that it isn't an act.
speaker1: why should he put on an act? your brother has told presidents where to go and what to do!
speaker3: the act would be for my sake, not steve's...

speaker1: wait for me. i'll be right back. 
speaker2: sidney moves after the girl, calling: "susie!"

speaker1: it's not my nature, susie, but i'll talk to you like an uncle... 
speaker2: but i don't need an uncle, sidney.

speaker1: no, i mean because i admire you - in fact, more than admire you - although that's neither here nor there. susie, don't sell your brother short. talk this over with him, i mean - you'll find him a real friend. 
speaker2: susan looks thoughtful, making no comment.
speaker3: carefully he prompts her:
speaker1: any message, in case i see j.j. later?
speaker2: she looks back at sidney, quietly firm.
speaker2: yes. tell him for me that steve dallas is the first real man i've ever been in love with...

speaker1: jimmy! this is a coincidence. i am just going - 
speaker2: yeah. a coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week! this is my press agent, joan. weldon, jibing at sidney, plays his remarks off the girl, who is amused; sidney, of course, is not.
speaker1: i tried to reach you twice -
speaker2: what do you do for that hundred a week. fall out of bed?
speaker1: jimmy, i'm on my way inside right now to talk to hunsecker. i can promise you -
speaker2: joan, call a cop! we'll arrest this kid for larceny!
speaker1: listen, when your band was playing at roseland -
speaker3: take it easy, jimmy dear...
speaker2: why? it's a dirty job, but i pay clean money for it, don't i?
speaker1: no more you don't! what is this - you're showing off for her? they're supposed to hear you in korea?
speaker2: he's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
speaker1: if you're funny, james, i'm a pretzel! drop dead!
speaker2: it was nice knowing you, sidney. not cheap - but nice. happy unemployment insurance.

speaker1: how are you tonight, mr. falco? 
speaker2: is "he" inside?
speaker1: but of course...
speaker2: alone or surrounded?
speaker1: a senator, an agent and something - with - long - red - hair.

speaker1: honey, get me mr. hunsecker. 
speaker2: he's right inside, mr. falco.
speaker1: so it isn't long distance.
speaker1: j.j.? it's me --
speaker1: j.j., it's sidney. can you come outside for one minute?
speaker3: can i come out? no.
speaker1: i have to talk to you, alone, j.j., that's why.
speaker3: you had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
speaker1: can i come in for a minute?
speaker3: no. you're dead, son - get yourself buried!

speaker1: mac! i don't want this man at my table... 
speaker2: i have a message from your sister.
speaker1: forgive me, harvey. we were interrupted before -
speaker3: err...the supreme court story, i was telling you - justice black.
speaker1: yes, the justice, that's right.
speaker2: last july, the lead item...
speaker3: and i believe that's precisely where i read it, too. you see, j.j., where i get my reputation for being the best-informed man in washington.
speaker1: now don't kid a kidder.

speaker1: sidney falco, sir. and, of course, everyone knows and admires you, senator walker. 
speaker2: every four years i get less convinced of that. this young lady is miss linda james. she's managed by manny davis.
speaker3: sidney nods pleasantly to the girl and the agent.
speaker1: i know manny davis.
speaker4: everyone knows manny davis... ...except mrs. manny davis.
speaker4: yes? go ahead, billy - shoot...

speaker1: uh huh. sports cars in california are getting smaller and smaller...the other day you were crossing hollywood boulevard and you were hit by one...you had to go to the hospital and have it removed... you're not following the column: i had it last week. 
speaker2: do you believe in capital punishment, senator?
speaker3: the senator, amused, asks:
speaker4: why?
speaker5: sidney glances sidelong at hunsecker.
speaker2: a man has just been sentenced to death...
speaker1: manny, what exactly are the unseen gifts of this lovely young thing that you manage...?

speaker1: well, she sings a little...you know, sings... 
speaker2: manny's faith in me is simply awe- inspiring, mr. hunsecker. actually, i'm still studying, but -
speaker3: he studies the girl intently.
speaker4: what subject?

speaker1: why "of course"? it might, for instance, be politics... 
speaker2: me? i mean "i"? are you kidding, mr. hunsecker? with my jersey city brains?
speaker3: again his glance links the girl and the senator.
speaker1: the brains may be jersey city, but the clothes are trainor-norell.

speaker1: are you an actor, mr. falco? 
speaker2: that's what i was thinking. are you, mr. falco?

speaker1: how did you guess it, miss james? 
speaker2: he's so pretty, that's how.

speaker1: mr. falco, let it be said at once, is a man of forty faces, not one, none too pretty and all deceptive. see that grin? it's the charming street urchin's face. it's part of his "helpless" act - he throws himself on your mercy. i skip the pleading nervous bit that sometimes blends over into bluster. the moist grateful eye is a favorite face with him - it frequently ties in with the act of boyish candor: he's talking straight from the heart, get it? he's got about half-a-dozen faces for the ladies, but the real cut one to me is the quick dependable chap - nothing he won't do for you in a pinch. at least, so he says! tonight mr. falco, whom i did not invite to sit at this table, is about to show in his last and most pitiful role: pale face with tongue hanging out. in brief, gentlemen and jersey lilly, the boy sitting with us is a hungry press agent and fully up to all the tricks of his very slimy trade! 
speaker1: match me, sidney...
speaker1: a single close up, to intercut with the above.

speaker1: i know - that loafer of yours opens at the latin quarter next week. say goodbye, lester! 
speaker2: may i ask a naive question, mr. falco? exactly how does a press agent work...?
speaker3: sidney doesn't answer.
speaker1: why don't you answer the man, sidalee? he's trying to take you off the hook.
speaker4: you just had a good example of it. a press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.

speaker1: what's manna? 
speaker2: hunsecker glances spitefully at the girl.
speaker3: heaven dust.
speaker4: but don't you help columnists by furnishing them with items?

speaker1: sure, columnists can't get along without us. only our good and great friend, j.j., forgets to mention that. we furnish him with items - 
speaker2: what, some cheap, gruesome gags?
speaker1: you print them, don't you?
speaker2: yes, with your clients' names attached. that's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world! now, as i make it out, you're doing me a favor!
speaker1: i didn't say that, j.j.
speaker2: the day that i can't get along without press agents' handouts, i'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to alaska.

speaker1: look, manny, you rode in here on the senator's shirt tails, so shut your mouth! the senator doesn't like this treatment of others and his manner and face show it. 
speaker2: now, come, j.j., that's a little too harsh. anyone seems fair game for you tonight.
speaker1: this man is not for you, harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public. because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.

speaker1: ...is toting that one... 
speaker1: ...around for you...
speaker2: he smiles disarmingly.
speaker1: ...are we kids or what?...

speaker1: next time you come up, you might join me at my tv show. 
speaker2: thank you, j.j., for what i consider sound advice.

speaker1: mac, don't let the senator pay that check... 
speaker2: i'll take care of it, mr. hunsecker.
speaker1: president! my big toe would make a better president!
speaker3: mr. hunsecker's coat, joe.
speaker1: find me a good one, joe.

speaker1: dan, anyone calls, tell 'em i'll be at the morocco, maybe the embers. 
speaker2: very good, mr. hunsecker.
speaker1: where's your coat, sidalee? saving tips?
speaker1: my curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight? sidney again does not answer; this time he points across the street...
speaker3: there's your fat friend.

speaker1: hello, harry. 
speaker1: you see, sidalee, that shows that lt. kello likes your people.
speaker2: kello offers his hand to hunsecker.
speaker3: it's my brooklyn background, j.j. i'm good on yiddish, too.
speaker1: harry, am i supposed to say "uncle"?
speaker1: anything fit to print, tonight? hello, phil. how're the kids.
speaker4: fine, mr. hunsecker.
speaker1: any news fit to print tonight?
speaker3: i just checked "downtown". quiet everywhere tonight.
speaker1: incidentally, what happened to that doll? - you gave me the item last night. still alive?
speaker3: yeah. at bellevue. still hanging on. but they still don't know if she was pushed.
speaker1: she mighta jumped. love suicide? check it for me, phil...it's a real heart throb.
speaker1: say hello to sidney falco. tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight.
speaker3: i don't believe it.
speaker5: i know...i know you're the strongest cop in town.
speaker3: i call him the boy with the ice cream face!
speaker1: say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's apt, harry!
speaker3: yeah, i got eyes. i put things together.
speaker1: i remember once when you didn't quite "put things together". boy! was the mayor mad!
speaker3: citizens committees! i didn't mean to hit the boy that hard. yeah, that's when a feller needed a friend and i won't forget his initials, j.j.
speaker4: she died twenty minutes ago, mr. hunsecker. they're still investigating.
speaker1: that's show business. thanks, phil. see you.
speaker3: hasta la vista, j.j. hasta luego.

speaker1: spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too. 
speaker2: i like harry, but i can't deny he sweats a little.
speaker2: i love this dirty town.

speaker1: conjugate me a verb, sidney. for instance, to promise! camera tracks with them in a close two shot. sidney is alert now. 
speaker1: you told me you'd break up that romance - when?
speaker2: you want something done, j.j., but i doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
speaker1: i'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
speaker2: why not break it up yourself? you could do it in two minutes flat.
speaker1: at this late date you need explanations...? susie's all i got - now that she's growing up, i want my relationship with her to stay at least at par! i don't intend to antagonize her if i don't have to. now, be warned, son - i'll have to blitz you...
speaker2: frankly, j.j., i don't think you got the cards to blitz me.
speaker1: i don't?
speaker2: correct me if i'm wrong, but i don't think so...
speaker1: i'll listen one more minute.
speaker2: about a year ago, you asked me to do a favor. it was a thing - well, i never did a thing that dirty in all my life. hunsecker, totally disinterested in sidney's problems of conscience, signals to his car again, walks past sidney, who continues rapidly:
speaker2: awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "sidney, i got a nasty little problem here." did i say no? i'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... but all of a sudden i can't get you on the phone no more! why?... and why, as of this date, am i frozen out of the column...
speaker1: are you finished?
speaker2: no, lemme finish. i don't like this job! that boy is only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head. and susan, like you said, she's growing up. two heads. what i mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
speaker1: not "we", sidney, you!
speaker2: correct me if i'm wrong - we! because when i'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
speaker1: ha! my right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
speaker2: i'll do it, j.j. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound. i'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head.
speaker1: what you promised - do it! don't finagle around. it's later than you think.
speaker2: excuse it, but it's later than you think. that boy proposed tonight.

speaker1: no wonder you've been so 'feisty' tonight. 
speaker1: can you deliver?
speaker2: uh huh.
speaker1: when?
speaker2: tonight. before you go to bed. the cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.

speaker1: don't be a two time loser, sidalee. 
speaker2: he is satisfied.

speaker1: reverse angle. a captain approaches sidney. 
speaker2: hello, sidney. wanna table?
speaker3: just hopping tonight. leo bartha been in?
speaker2: yeah, having supper with the mrs. she's over there.
speaker2: he's somewhere...
speaker3: thanks, i see him...

speaker1: who told you about it? 
speaker2: sidney smiles at bartha, but the threat is clear.
speaker2: the cigarettes girl...rita. and she took out all her hairpins, too.

speaker1: i never had the pleasure of meeting your wife. you know what i wonder, leo? could you use a hot little item for tomorrow's column? 
speaker2: what is this, blackmail? beat it!

speaker1: leo, i've never had the pleasure of meeting your wife... 
speaker2: loretta...sidney falco...
speaker3: how do you do, mr. falco. if you know anything about horses, sit a minute. help yourself to a glass of this n.y. state champagne - that's what my husband buys me. mrs. bartha pushes the champagne bottle in sidney's direction as sidney sits pleasantly; bartha concentrates on his sandwich.
speaker1: all the imported wines aren't what they're cracked up to be.
speaker3: whose side are you on, mr. falco, his or mine?
speaker1: frankly, mrs. bartha, i'm a neutral observer for the united nations.
speaker3: mrs. bartha laughs, enjoying his deftness; then:
speaker3: what's your first name?
speaker1: sidney.
speaker3: no horse running tomorrow by that name...

speaker1: you ought to stop this nonsense, loretta, these two dollar bets. 
speaker2: it's compensation, leo, for the marginal life we lead. sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
speaker1: that's right! tell him, so i can read it in hunsecker's column first!
speaker2: oh, are you a spy for the other side?
speaker3: no, i actually sat down to give leo an item.
speaker2: leo, he wants to give you an item - don't be sullen.
speaker1: will you mind your own business!
speaker2: hitler!
speaker3: just in case you'd like to print it, leo. it's a blind - no names mentioned. but for your private information, the guy's name is dallas.
speaker2: there isn't a single name here that gives off vibrations...
speaker3: anything there with a name like "cigarette girl"?
speaker2: mmmmmm..."cigarette girl"... no, no horse with a name like that...

speaker1: i don't print blind items. 
speaker2: she looks from sidney to her husband and back.
speaker3: what is this, chess or checkers...?

speaker1: neither does hunsecker. he likes to use the real names... 
speaker2: where are we running? what am i missing here?
speaker3: waiter, the check. this man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
speaker4: bartha turns challengingly to sidney.
speaker3: what do you want to tell my wife, sidney...?
speaker2: she is brushing her lap with her napkin.
speaker2: he wants to tell me that you poured champagne all over my lap.
speaker5: bartha ignores her, again challenges sidney.
speaker3: go on, tell her, i'm waiting!

speaker1: he glances unhappily at his wife. 
speaker1: lorry, i can't let this man blackmail me...

speaker1: blackmail...? 
speaker2: he wants me to print a dirty smear item for keeping his mouth shut a momentarily pause. then:
speaker1: about what?
speaker3: he is uneasy, ashamed of himself.
speaker2: foolishly, lorry, and i hope you'll understand... this cigarette girl...i was kidding around with her...this girl, i mean...i was kidding around and she took it seriously. it was a case of bad judgment, lorry, bad taste...and i'm just sorry, lorry, that's all...
speaker4: she says nothing.

speaker1: your friend hunsecker - you can tell him for me - he's a disgrace to his profession. never mind my bilious private life - i print a decent, responsible column - that's the way it stays! your man - there's nothing he won't print if it satisfies his vanity or his spite! he'll use any spice to pepper up his daily garbage! tell him i said so and that, like yourself, he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster! 
speaker2: what do i do now? whistle "the stars and stripes forever?"

speaker1: a waiter approaches sidney. he has a message. 
speaker1: otis elwell wants to see you, sidney.
speaker2: from sidney's viewpoint. elwell beckons.

speaker1: i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper. hey, wait a minute! 
speaker2: otis, if you're trying to blow this brawl into an item for your column - forget it!

speaker1: how is dear old j.j. by the way? 
speaker2: call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
speaker1: if it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...

speaker1: ...talk of a wake! - they'd club each other to cater the affair for free! 
speaker2: elwell looks up at sidney as he continues.
speaker1: by the way, did i hear something about j.j. giving you the flit gun treatment - he shut you out of the column. why?

speaker1: you don't know that lunatic yet? whims - egotistic whims! like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy! that's what the fight with bartha was about. "leo", i says, "hunsecker froze me out. so i'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item." 
speaker2: and, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
speaker1: i see you're full of human feelings...
speaker2: he has lost interest in sidney.
speaker2: like most of the human race, sidney, i'm bored. i'd go a mile for a chuckle...

speaker1: three...even four... 
speaker1: then you're really washed up with hunsecker...?

speaker1: look, otis, i make no brief for my bilious private life, but he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster. 
speaker2: a fine, fat dirty item. who's it about?
speaker1: a kid named dallas, who runs a dinky jazz quintet. he keeps company with j.j.'s screwball sister...

speaker1: watching elwell read, sidney encourages: 
speaker2: it's a real goody if, like me, you wanna clobber j.j.!
speaker2: he's got his tv tomorrow. he'd read it just before rehearsals.
speaker3: mmm. trouble is i can't think of any good reason why i should print anything you give me. i can't even think of a bad reason.

speaker1: rita, say hello to otis elwell. 
speaker2: hello.

speaker1: friends call me otis - sometimes tricky otis. 
speaker2: otis was outraged when i told him van cleve was going to fire you. tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what. right, otis?
speaker1: right!
speaker2: i thought you two could talk the whole thing over till i got back.
speaker3: back?
speaker2: one of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
speaker3: hold on. you can drop me off on your way... emphasizing the asperity in her voice, she closes the door behind her.

speaker1: consternation reigns... 
speaker2: now, otis...
speaker1: i hate j.j. -- but not that much at this moment...
speaker2: give me a chance --

speaker1: don't you know who that man is? 
speaker2: yeah. otis elwell. the columnist.
speaker1: yeah!
speaker2: and he's a perfect stranger to me.
speaker1: so take five minutes! get acquainted! he's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
speaker2: what do you want all of a sudden - lady godiva...? where's my other shoe?
speaker1: what kind of an act is this?
speaker2: don't you think i have any feelings? what am i? a bowl of fruit? a tangerine that peels in a minute?
speaker1: i beg your pardon! i turn myself inside out to help you and now i'm a heavy. here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door! contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her arms. the positive force of his manner gives the girl pause. there is a silence. rita searches for words to explain the offense to her sensibilities.
speaker2: sidney...i...i don't do this sort of thing...
speaker1: what sort of thing?
speaker2: this sort of thing!
speaker1: listen, you need him for a favor, don't you! and so do i! i need his column--tonight. didn't you ask me to do something about your job? don't you have a kid in military school?
speaker2: you're a snake, falco. you're a louse, a real louse.
speaker1: honey - he's going to help you! you want to lose your job?
speaker2: a girl needs a little romancing before she -
speaker1: next time i'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!
speaker2: what would you think of me if -
speaker1: nothing i didn't think of you before.
speaker2: - that's what i mean!
speaker1: how many snorts does it take to put you in that tropical island mood?

speaker1: havana! that's where we met! 
speaker2: here's mud in your column!
speaker3: blessings on thee, the both...well... gotta run now. see you two kids later!
speaker1: hurry back.
speaker3: don't do anything i wouldn't do.

speaker1: palm springs. two years ago. 
speaker2: that's right!
speaker1: don't tell sidney.

speaker1: the globe? 
speaker2: gimme the record.

speaker1: i have no power to retract, mr. cummings... i'm only mr. hunsecker's secretary. no. nor can i agree that can retraction is necessary. thank you for calling. sidney has come through the newsroom in background. he pauses tactfully, seeing mary occupied with the lawyer. 
speaker2: i fail to see what's amusing about these papers.
speaker1: i'll get the boss to sign them.
speaker2: they're important.
speaker1: you've said that six times - that's why i'm smiling.
speaker3: hello, mary, me darlin' and phwat are ye up to today?
speaker1: that's a question i usually like to ask you. your secretary phoned.
speaker3: what about?
speaker1: have you seen this? in otis elwell's column. "the dreamy marijuana smoke of a lad who heads a highbrow jazz quintet is giving an inelegant odor to that elegant east side club where he works. that's no way for a card-holding party member to act. moscow won't like, you naughty boy!"
speaker3: sally? i got the message. if d'angelo calls again, tell him i'll be at the office around noon.
speaker1: could this be that boy?
speaker3: dallas? could be. he doesn't look like a reefer smoker... he discards the paper with a show of disinterest. mary picks it up again.
speaker1: if this is true, j.j.'s going to hit the ceiling...
speaker3: can it be news to you that j.j.'s ceiling needs a plaster job every six weeks?

speaker1: sidney, you know that j.j. doesn't like people to look at the column proof in advance... 
speaker2: mary, i'm not "people" - there's falco blood, sweat and tears in that column.
speaker2: how about dinner tonight?
speaker1: bribing me again?
speaker2: and why should i bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
speaker1: you're a real rascal, sidney. i'd certainly dislike you if i didn't like you. you're an amusing boy, but there isn't a drop of respect in you for anything alive - you're too immersed in the theology of making a fast buck. not that i don't sometimes feel that you yearn for something better...
speaker1: i don't mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance, as long as j.j. doesn't know. but don't do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine. sidney doesn't like this; but, on the other hand, he does want to look at the column. after only a momentary struggle, he picks the column off the spike and reads.
speaker2: who put this item in about the comic? "if there's a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name. we were too busy screaming." does this temple have a press agent?
speaker1: no. it's one of j.j.'s occasional beau gestes. evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
speaker2: what's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
speaker1: let's wait till christmas - it's more legitimate then.

speaker1: herbit temple here yet? 
speaker2: yeah, but you can't come in now!
speaker1: i'm in, sonny boy!

speaker1: i didn't waste words, herbie, take my word. i says, "look, figo, i'm not selling you a dozen eggs, i'm selling you herbie temple", i says, so don't gimme your lip! 
speaker2: hiya, al!
speaker1: since when did you two get acquainted?
speaker2: how do you do, mr. temple...
speaker1: delighted.
speaker2: i'm sidney falco.
speaker3: yeah, delighted...
speaker1: watch this guy, herbie, he's a press agent.
speaker3: you watch him, al, i s...s...stutter!
speaker2: temple, i caught your act the other night and -
speaker3: did you now? on which bounce?
speaker2: - and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were.
speaker3: cheers. what time is it, al?
speaker1: you got ten minutes. hope you don't mind, falco: we're busy and if - sidney stands up.
speaker2: no, i don't mind. i'm busy too.
speaker3: good! we're all off to utica, so excuse me, mr. frannis-on-the- portisan. sidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor. the chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth.
speaker2: but can i ask one impertinent question here? with no criticism intended, because i know, al, you earn your ten percent, how come you let a sock act like herbie temple tip-toe through town without a publicity build...?
speaker1: we're not buying it, falco - no fish today.
speaker2: i'm not selling. i'm just curious, that's all.
speaker3: answer the man, al, if he asks you a question. quick, before he thinks up another!
speaker1: mr. temple doesn't believe in press agents - does that answer you something?

speaker1: take your hand off, lump! no one believes in press agents, temple, when they make claims they can't perform. i got nothing to sell - i didn't come here to peddle - but if i tell a client that hunsecker will give him space, it's not just talk! 
speaker2: listen, you bull artist - !
speaker3: let him go, al...

speaker1: sure, i'll wait... 
speaker1: relax, lump! i told you i'm not selling fish... j.j...sidney!...how are you, sweetheart? yeah... listen, i know it's late, j.j., but is it too late to add something important to the column? no, not a relative, but important...

speaker1: yeah, if you got a pencil there i'll suggest a word or two. uh...uh... 
speaker1: if there's a funnier man in the world than herbie temple at the palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing. no, make that 'screaming'. it's sweet of you, j.j., thanks. probably see you at twenty one tonight. no, for supper, late.
speaker2: speak to this lad, al, ... to mr.
speaker1: see me in my office.

speaker1: wait a minute. speak to him, al. al makes all my deals. 
speaker2: i don't like a guy that's quick with the hands. temple, you've been three passes behind for twenty years. this could start you off big - t.v. and anywhere.
speaker1: and it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
speaker2: you tell him, i stutter!
speaker3: uh...why don't we wait till tomorrow?

speaker1: you read as you run, don't you? 
speaker2: it's a habit with me. so now i'm briefed. so what?
speaker1: frank thinks i shouldn't have come here -
speaker3: excuse me, steve. i said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
speaker1: i thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
speaker4: favoring sidney. he pauses.
speaker2: why me...?
speaker1: why not you?
speaker2: that's your idea of logic? i tell the judge i didn't murder the man - the judge says, "why not you?"
speaker1: only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or hunsecker or both.
speaker2: dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife. so how do you get him doing j.j. a favor?
speaker1: it is a favor, isn't it?
speaker2: according to you, yeah. dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty! i don't like you, comma, but neither do i go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the reds. also, since we're talking repulsive, j.j. won't like this for two cents! don't give me that look, dallas - j.j. believes in fair play. and secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!

speaker1: you're talking very fast. 
speaker2: well, i'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya? how do you like it? he comes to my office and -

speaker1: boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, steve and - 
speaker2: don't apologize for me, frank!
speaker1: ...excited with good reason, i wanted to say. because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
speaker3: should i cry...?
speaker1: ...people catch on quick to such an item. van cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
speaker3: then what are you doing here? go over there and fight! if van cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
speaker2: i want to speak to miss hunsecker, please.
speaker1: we're on our way there now...
speaker3: what are you calling her for...?

speaker1: we're on our way to the elysian room to dicker with van cleve - he's fired us already. i'll call you later, dear... 'bye!... 
speaker1: come on, frank.

speaker1: the ugly world, sidney... if i told steve what i really think, he'd tear your head off... 
speaker2: he brazens it out.
speaker3: tell him.
speaker4: d'angelo shakes his head.
speaker1: no. i'm interested in his future.

speaker1: what's the matter? 
speaker2: nothing...
speaker1: you know, sally, sometimes i get the impression you think you live in star-bright park. this is life, kid - get used to it!

speaker1: did you send my folks in philly the check...? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: i put a lotta trust in you, chickie...
speaker2: i know you do, sidney.
speaker1: don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
speaker2: i'm not judging...
speaker2: i swear, sidney, i can't help it - sometimes i wonder what i see in you...
speaker1: that's no way to talk...
speaker2: or what you see in me, for that matter...
speaker1: stay down town tonight. maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
speaker2: if you want me to -
speaker1: hello, j.j....i presume you saw the elwell smear. no, no medals - not yet. oh, it's worse than that - aunty van cleve is firing them...from the horse's mouth... they were just here - in a panic...

speaker1: who was just there? you'll be the death of me. sidalee! why? didn't you just tell me that they've already traced this smear to you? all they have to do now is to put two and two together and i'm a chicken in a pot! 
speaker2: sidney smiles confidently, answers calmly:
speaker3: j.j., peace on earth, good will to men - it's working out just the way i planned. yeah, i guarantee this bomb will pop right on schedule, but you have to play your part - you be a saint and let me be the devil. but i wanna talk to you first...
speaker4: hunsecker pauses, eyes full of cold voltage.
speaker1: don't come here. susie is up and about. he called her? you'd better see me at the tv - three o'clock.

speaker1: what are you going to do? 
speaker2: chickie, a lotta people think they're smart. you watch. they're dumb: they'll do the work for me! just watch.

speaker1: the table can wait. no calls. i have to think about my tv show. 
speaker2: pleased to do. i will come back later.
speaker1: did you put the bread out on the terrace for the birds?
speaker2: yes, but they don't come no more this time of year.
speaker1: susie! come in a minute, dear...
speaker1: susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
speaker3: why?
speaker1: what a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
speaker3: did sidney tell you about it?
speaker1: yes, he phoned. i don't know this boy too well. anything in these charges?
speaker1: not being partial, are you?
speaker3: no, i'm not. i'm not!
speaker1: susie, take it easy. i'll trust your judgment - you don't have to protest with me.
speaker1: why are you trembling, dear...?
speaker3: history repeats itself. everything that happened to alan leslie...began with a smear like this...
speaker1: yes...
speaker3: it's just as if i've seen a ghost today...
speaker1: but that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to leslie. i've told you that a million times... he goes to her gently; she appraises both him and her wrenched life with brooding, frightened eyes.
speaker3: then whose fault was it, j.j.? it was someone's fault, wasn't it?
speaker1: i wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
speaker3: alan was not...unbalanced when i married him. and he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said!
speaker1: i'm not fighting with you, puss... she gets up and walks around in considerable agitation.
speaker3: he never would have killed himself if i hadn't gone through with the annulment. don't you see that made all the rumors seem true? i should have stood up for him...not run out.
speaker4: j.j., i want you to get them back their job, steve and the quintet.
speaker1: you mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
speaker1: susie, you're sure there isn't some fire where there's this much smoke?
speaker4: i know steve. no.
speaker1: then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
speaker3: sidney is a liar!
speaker1: who said sidney?
speaker3: i said sidney!...
speaker1: you know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and i, and i don't like that.
speaker3: i thought we were talking about sidney?
speaker1: let me finish, dear. you had your say, now let me have mine...
speaker1: i started to say we're drifting apart. a year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me? today i had to call you in!
speaker3: i'm taking up the situation with you now...
speaker1: susie, i want to help you--, there's nothing i won't do for you. you're all i've got in the whole, wide world. hunsecker strides about, elaborately playing on a note of disillusion and pain.
speaker1: well, what have i got? alimony to a pair of tramps? they're of no concern to me. it's you who count, but don't get me wrong - i don't intend to let you break your neck again!
speaker4: j.j., you said you want to help me - prove it!
speaker1: how?
speaker4: get steve back his job...please...
speaker1: he means that much to you...?
speaker4: yes. with your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of american tel and tel.
speaker1: you're picking up my lingo, hon.
speaker1: susie, i like this new attitude of yours. you're growing up and i like it! i don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward. this gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world. because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
speaker4: no, i won't...
speaker1: this dallas boy must be good for you. why not bring him around today, before the show? this time i'll clean my glasses for a better look.
speaker4: i'm not sure i can reach him in time.
speaker1: sure you can if you want to, and i know you'll want to... by the way, what's your beef against little sidney?
speaker3: when i'm certain, i'll let you know...
speaker1: a man couldn't ask for a squarer shake. let me have billy van cleve... don't ever tell anyone, susie, how i'm tied to your apron strings... billy! j.j.! what's this about that boy? what boy? where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? you're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, dallas!... no, don't explain your point of view, but...

speaker1: "i was reminded of it this morning, when i noticed that the birds had gone south. we want the same kind of freedom for ourselves - that's what the man said! a man has the right to face his accusers! that's the american way! who said? the man said! from..." he turns in exasperation to burton. 
speaker1: burton, don't stand around. if i go over i'll cut some items off the tail...

speaker1: "from washington through to jefferson, from lincoln and f.d.r. right up to today - the democratic way of life! that's what the man said! nowadays it doesn't export to well... but you know...and i know...that our best secret weapon is d-e-m-o- 
speaker2: let's never forget it, ladies and gentlemen."

speaker1: that's grand, just grand, j.j.! is my makeup all right? you know, despite the scads of movies i've made, i've never appeared on tv yet... 
speaker2: of course, mildred. of course. you look fine. mary, help miss tam - anything she wants; she's our star today.

speaker1: i got that boy coming over here. what's so funny? 
speaker2: with a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
speaker1: i think you loused this up but good. if i can trust my eyes, and i think i can, susie knows all about your dirty work.
speaker2: can't hurt...
speaker1: can't hurt? i had to get him back his job.
speaker2: i like that, too. look, j.j., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion. we're going great, but please play it my way. i cased this kid. know his ins and outs...he's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze. do little sidney a favor: squeeze! - you know, j.j. - the porcupine bit - needles.
speaker1: but it's too late. i got him back the job...
speaker2: no, that's the point - he won't accept your favor! the manager yes, but not the boy.
speaker1: well he's got her in a tizzy, i'll tell you that!
speaker2: sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
speaker1: and who's feet is she on now?
speaker2: presumably yours... that's according to st. dallas.
speaker1: what's this boy got that susie likes?
speaker2: integrity - acute, like indigestion.
speaker1: what does that mean - integrity?
speaker2: a pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match! it's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... i never thought i'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
speaker1: full of beans, ain't you? but you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
speaker2: calculated risk. only we happen to know, j.j., that you like me. i'm your star pupil -- i reflect back to you your own talent. hunsecker permits himself a faint smile. burton is approaching with script in hand.
speaker1: i wouldn't like to take a bite of you; you're a cookie full of arsenic.

speaker1: i still think he's responsible for the smear. 
speaker2: not that i'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years. steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
speaker1: i guess you're right, but -

speaker1: he studies them, then calls out: 
speaker2: looks like a wedding.

speaker1: steve, you remember my brother... 
speaker2: of course.
speaker3: well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
speaker4: you've been very kind about it, mr.
speaker3: give susie credit for that. i took her word that there was nothing to the smear. matter of fact, i'll have my say about smears on the show today. that's why i'd like your personal assurance, too.
speaker4: mr. hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear. you have my sincere word...
speaker3: i'll by that, son. now, you owe me a favor. be good to my kid sister...
speaker3: susie likes to keep her girlish secrets. but in her heart of hearts i imagine, dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. now, what about you, son? not just tom-catting around...i hope?
speaker1: j.j., steve isn't... hunsecker cuts her off with lazy good nature:
speaker3: take it easy, susie. he wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern. would you, son?
speaker4: no, i wouldn't...
speaker3: serious as a deacon...i like it. i like your style, son! in a world of old rags and bones, i like it! for instance, take sidney.
speaker3: if sidney got anywhere near susie i'd break a bat over sidney's head! sidney lives so much in a moral twilight that, when i said you were coming here, he predicted disaster. you wouldn't take my favor -- you'd chew up the job, he said, and spit it right back in my face! any truth in that...?

speaker1: frank, you don't listen! j.j. just told you to shut your mouth! 
speaker2: don't you think it's about time you shut yours? who are you to tell a man like frank d'angelo to shut up?!
speaker3: steve, that isn't important --
speaker2: does he have to be here in our hair?

speaker1: just exactly what are you so hot about? i mean, i know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but -- 
speaker2: nuts! i'm not here as an artist! i'm here as an average joe, who happens to love your sister susie!
speaker1: frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill. just give us the punch line...
speaker2: no punch line. maybe i was just admiring your know-how---yours and falco's.

speaker1: wild? take a look at them and see who's wild... 
speaker2: what about that...?
speaker3: steve was excited...he didn't mean it exactly the way it's stated here...
speaker2: how did you mean it...?
speaker4: hunsecker enters from behind camera.
speaker2: both of you keep quiet! you've made more damage here in one minute than a plague of locusts! if you're tired, susie, sit down--- this needs investigation! how did you mean it...? come on, let's go! let's go!...
speaker5: i don't take kindly to you and falco selling me ethics. who's the injured party here, you?
speaker2: right now you're in no position to ask questions! and your snide remarks---
speaker5: wait a minute, i haven't handed over punishing privileges to you yet! put the whip down and i might respect what you're saying... switching his leonine tail, hunsecker looks broodingly at susie. frank says one beseeching word, "steve...", but no one hears him.
speaker2: susie, did you know about this accusation...?

speaker1: mr. hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels. 
speaker2: you hear that, susie... continue please...
speaker1: i'm afraid i can't cope with them.

speaker1: you're too shrewd for me so i'll just be honest. susie and i love each other, if i'm not mistaken, and we want to get married. 
speaker2: give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
speaker1: why don't we hear what susie has to say?
speaker3: that's stout of you, dallas, but susie may not care to air her dismal views in public...
speaker1: susie...?
speaker4: she stares at the floor.

speaker1: susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks. go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear. 
speaker2: those "dears" sound like daggers. may i suggest that you stop daring her to speak?
speaker1: may i lift my eyebrows? what is this? what are you trying to do?
speaker2: i'm trying to get susie to stand up to you. but your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
speaker1: son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!

speaker1: steve, if only for my sake, i want this stopped! and the same goes for you, too, j.j.! 
speaker2: he interjects.
speaker2: susie, i'm sorry if---

speaker1: you see, dallas, a plague on both our houses... we may have to call this game on account of darkness... 
speaker1: if looks could kill, i'm dead...
speaker2: no, i don't care about you -- you're fantastic. my whole interest, if it's not too late, is in susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
speaker1: and what have i done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately? sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
speaker2: why? because i don't like the way you toy with human lives? - your contempt and malice? because i won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled susie...? you think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, mr. hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
speaker1: son, i don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns. so suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
speaker2: but my day with susie isn't over yet and--
speaker1: ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!

speaker1: you in a mood, susie, to run over to milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks? 
speaker2: no. i'm going home.
speaker1: want sidney to drive you over?
speaker1: drive susie home.

speaker1: i'll get you a cab... 
speaker2: get away from me.
speaker1: j.j. asked me to drive you over and -

speaker1: so that's what "integrity" looks like. well, i'm always willing to learn... how is that slob, d'angelo, your uncle? 
speaker2: my mother's side--her brother. that reminds me, j.j., susie looks run down. she can stand a vacation and so can you. people say, "oh, the great j.j., he's made of iron!", but you can use a rest, guy.
speaker1: what are you so chipper about? if i put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
speaker2: but not for anything i did today...
speaker1: sidney, i know human nature. susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
speaker2: you're right, j.j. - she won't give him up, but it doesn't matter. because the real "money ball" is the boy, not susan. and if --

speaker1: these drinks are warm. 
speaker2: you said you like to have them on your table.
speaker1: what are you a critic?
speaker2: i'll change --
speaker1: forget it. the real money ball is the boy...
speaker3: yeah, the boy...we're on the verge of a farce, a real farce. as i see it, if susie had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat. but since primarily he's wedded to his work, he's not going to be able to take it.
speaker1: stop tinkering, pal - that horse radish won't jump a fence!
speaker3: in brief, j.j., it's all over because any hour now the boy will give her up. is it a farce or not?
speaker1: this syrup you're giving out, sidney, you pour over waffles, not j.j. hunsecker! what do you mean that lousy kid will give up my sister?
speaker4: hunsecker continues:
speaker1: are you listening?
speaker3: how does it matter who's sister? the main thing, they're through and -

speaker1: brief epitaph: "the boy was talking when he should have been listening." bite on this. 
speaker2: steamship tickets?
speaker1: for the next sailing of the mary. susan's run down - she's never been abroad and as you so cogently put it, i'm not made of iron. sidney slowly pushes the envelope back to hunsecker, who leaves it lying on the table before him.
speaker2: that's good. now that louse is outa susie's hair for good.

speaker1: why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms? not to mention that this time susie would know who shot the arrow... 
speaker2: she knows now.
speaker1: why give her real proof? you nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, j.j., - but she almost followed him out the window. what do you want - a chronic invalid?

speaker1: why, what's tomorrow - a holiday? 
speaker1: i think i'll go home - maybe i left my sense of humor in another suit.

speaker1: i'm leaving, j.j.... 
speaker2: shooting across sidney onto hunsecker.
speaker3: don't remove the gangplank, sidney; you may wanna get back on board.
speaker1: sidney feels the chill of despair upon him.
speaker3: this crab gumbo - terrific!

speaker1: j.j., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...i'd rather have my freedom. 
speaker2: the man in jail is always for freedom.
speaker1: except, if you'll excuse me, i'm not in jail.
speaker2: from sidney's viewpoint.
speaker2: sure you're in jail, sidney. you're a prisoner of your own fears, of your own greed and ambition; you're in jail.
speaker1: from hunsecker's viewpoint.
speaker1: j.j. if you're trying to -
speaker2: you, little boy, don't know who you are! talking around corners with the big shots, ten dollar dinners - fourteen suits and cashmere coats - you tell yourself that's who you are! later you won't know who you are without a penthouse on upper park! but underneath it all, ratting around from day to day, you do know who you are! you're a fearful, ignorant nobody - a poor wop kid from the slums of philly - hoping nobody else finds it out!

speaker1: i told you what i want you to do tonight! 
speaker2: he looks down on hunsecker, leans over the table.
speaker2: you're blind, mr. magoo. this is a crossroads for me. i won't get kello. not for a life-time pass to the polo grounds. not if you serve me ingrid bergman on a plate.
speaker1: sidney, i told you -
speaker2: j.j., i swear to you on my mother's life, i won't do it. if you gave me your column i wouldn't do a thing like that... but as he speaks the last words, sidney's voice falters because he has glanced down at the table...

speaker1: thank you, sidney. 
speaker1: and, sidney, i'll have that piece of paper back...

speaker1: she'll be down in a minute. 
speaker2: what does she wanna see you about?
speaker1: she didn't say.
speaker2: i could think of better places to meet her, instead of here. he lives on the whole top floor.
speaker1: i doubt that it matters any more.
speaker2: he addresses steve soberly.
speaker2: steve. you made a very dangerous enemy of him today. matter of fact, i'm very glad we got the tour ahead. if i'm any judge, you hurt him today where he lives... he won't forget it and he won't forgive...

speaker1: hello, steve. i'm glad you could come. 
speaker2: why did you call me?
speaker1: would you buy me a cup of coffee?

speaker1: sure. 
speaker1: we're on our way to robard's for a benefit. i've only got five minutes...

speaker1: too late for service. 
speaker2: just two cups of java.
speaker1: we serve here only moka coffee.
speaker2: make it moke.

speaker1: steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...i couldn't go all the way...i failed you... will you forgive me? have i lost you, steve? have i...? 
speaker2: well, maybe i was wrong, too... but there's no doubt, susie, that we have to face some serious things...
speaker1: no one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
speaker2: but you didn't do much about it, susie. you walked out, and there i was...solo...and not too good at that.
speaker1: i just didn't think that i could antagonize him, steve -- for our sake, i mean.

speaker1: steve, i... 
speaker2: but i don't care about that now. he knew what he was doing today. he was laying down the conditions under which he might consent to our marriage - if i would bend to every whim of his, like sidney! i couldn't do that, susie...
speaker1: after a pause, she says:
speaker1: you're saying goodbye, aren't you?
speaker3: steve flares up.
speaker2: no! i'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
speaker1: but, please, steve, please - one step at a time! i was born only yesterday!...
speaker2: i told your brother i couldn't be his accomplice. i can't be yours either, susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you. i know what type - he's my old man all over again! susan, pathetically despairing, fingers the handle of her coffee cup, which she has not touched. the coat slips from her shoulders...

speaker1: this beautiful coat is more than just a coat... i hate it! it's a mink straight-jacket! 
speaker2: steve, i feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
speaker1: not what you're doing now. at least don't ask me - don't ask him. you're fighting for your life!
speaker2: you are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
speaker1: he reacts vigorously, protesting:
speaker1: that's fish four days old...! i can't buy it, susie! right out of that mouth i love, like you're a ventriloquist's dummy, your brother is saying goodbye! gee!...you want me to be honest, don't you?!
speaker2: a despairing cry:
speaker2: no, steve, i don't. i don't. not if it kills me i don't!...

speaker1: goodbye, mr. d'angelo. take care of steve. 
speaker2: i will, miss hunsecker.

speaker1: d'angelo turns back to steve. 
speaker2: still there...

speaker1: not that i don't like her - she's a very lovely person, but who can tell? a year from now you might thank your stars that it turned out this way. by the way, robard said that... 
speaker2: frank, i don't want to make the benefit. they'll be jammin' all night, and the way i feel -- i'd like to be alone -- i'd like just to walk and walk and never come back.
speaker1: no. i don't leave you alone on a night like this. and, anyway, you promised...

speaker1: lew, steve don't feel too good... 
speaker2: i'm sorry to hear it.

speaker1: ...so, if you don't mind, he'll leave after this set. in b.g., sidney sets down his drink, reacting to this information. robard clamps d'angelo on the shoulder, reassuring him with warm emphasis: 
speaker2: i like that boy, frank. anything he does is okay with me...
speaker3: sidney, thinking rapidly, leaves the bar, moving

speaker1: what's this deal tonight? 
speaker1: one of these days i'd like to turn in my badge and tangle with "popsie" myself - he's no good.

speaker1: can't you wait up the block? it's not going to look so good, right in front of the club... 
speaker2: it's nice, sidney, that you give me this tip...
speaker1: - he's got them on him.
speaker2: ...and he's got them on him. i appreciate a thing like that - i appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
speaker2: what's your hurry, snooks?
speaker2: murph, how do you like this face? why, i'll be -- it's melting! something got you scared, sidney...? listen, rectify me a certain thing. wasn't you kidding, snooks, when you told j.j. i was fat...?
speaker1: sleep in peace, kello -- you're skinny -- but j.j. says you sweat!

speaker1: is that a fact? he's a dilly, ain't he? by the by, what did he have against this boy? 
speaker2: he goes out with girls.
speaker1: well, i'll be darned. and what does j.j. think he should do?
speaker2: go out with different girls!
speaker1: he moves forward a little.
speaker1: i get the peculiar impression, snooks, that you don't like me.

speaker1: press this in your friendship book...love is a crooked thing, friendship not... you see, it comes out in the wash of a few drinks -- i'm a very sentimental guy. 
speaker2: steve is touched.
speaker3: i like it that way, frank...don't change.

speaker1: a bunch of nickels, mister! 
speaker1: a double johnny walker black. or whatever you got. scotch.

speaker1: hey, robard, somebody just picked up one of your boys. 
speaker2: what sa -- wha --

speaker1: whatsa matter, lou? 
speaker2: i'm trying to find out myself.
speaker3: some fat guy...
speaker4: a cop, a couple of cops.
speaker3: they smeared him all over the lot.

speaker1: i'm looking for your brother. is he home? 
speaker2: no. mr. d'angelo - is something wrong?
speaker1: when does he usually gets in, your night-owl brother?
speaker2: seldom before five. what's the matter? would you care to come in a minute?
speaker1: no...no. thanks.
speaker1: he's in the hospital...he's under arrest, too... they planted reefer cigarettes on him...in his overcoat pocket.
speaker1: miss hunsecker, if you see him again they might...might kill him.
speaker2: who is "they"?
speaker1: don't ask foolish questions. tell your brother i'm a sensible man. he understands only two things - power-politics and homage - tell him i came tonight to pay homage!

speaker1: where's j.j.? 
speaker2: she walks forwards.
speaker3: he isn't here...
speaker1: but he called and said...
speaker3: no, i called...

speaker1: he's...unconscious... 
speaker1: i...i gave steve up... why did you and j.j. do it?

speaker1: listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day. feeling sorry for yourself won't help. 
speaker2: i'm sorry about steve, not myself. i'm even sorry for my brother. to be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
speaker1: come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
speaker2: and i'm sorry for you, too, sidney.
speaker1: what ship?
speaker2: this ship.
speaker2: don't you know how my brother will see you after tonight? you'll be the man who drove his little stainless sister to suicide...

speaker1: he strides back towards her. 
speaker2: susie, whatever problems you have with j.j. - i didn't invent them! what're you blaming me for? if you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
speaker3: like you?
speaker2: yeah! like me! i don't choke on my own gall - i fight back! let them choke, not me!
speaker3: i'm not a man, sidney, i'm -
speaker2: i know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! so what do you pick such weak sisters for? don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
speaker3: i could almost forgive you if what you did to steve came from jealousy and love...
speaker2: i didn't do anything!
speaker3: ...but you did it for greed, sidney - and that's pathetic.
speaker2: don't run away - i was always the man for you! i'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what i say! inside of six months -

speaker1: go to bed, susie. it's late... 
speaker1: what is he doing here?
speaker2: i called him.
speaker1: that subject it might be better not to start me on. he's made all the papers tonight.

speaker1: is there something you wanted to say...? i've put up with a lot of your guff, susie, because you were a child. but you're a woman now and i suspect, despite my best intentions, more than a bit of a slut... 
speaker2: her head comes up sharply at the insult.

speaker1: j.j., if you think - 
speaker2: don't explain, sidney... it doesn't matter now...
speaker3: whose arms will i have to pry you out of next? not that i don't think you didn't invite it! i know that look of yours, that pose of being wronged - and how it arouses the crusading instinct in even a sidney falco - hunsecker's rising tide of brutality is having some effect on susan, and sidney, fearing for her, tries to intervene.
speaker1: i was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
speaker3: is that why you were romancing her, you mutt! let's call it quits, my dear. i'd like it fine if you found another home. that means the front door is open! pack your things, rent a moving van and git! and as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage! you're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men! susan is staring sightlessly at the floor near hunsecker's feet. after a moment she turns and moves to the door of her bedroom; her walk is a little unsteady; she goes inside, closes the door in hunsecker's face.

speaker1: now we'll get to you, sidney. as far as the column is concerned - tonight you have forfeited every ethical consideration i ever felt for you... 
speaker2: look, j.j., i'll grant you anything you want. susie's off her rocker tonight! go in and see what she's doing! go in and talk to her quietly - unless you want a corpse! sidney's conviction is impressive. but hunsecker is unwilling to admit the danger, he continues.

speaker1: what a cornball you are, sidney... camera tracks to include sidney. he does not share hunsecker's confidence; he knocks again, calling: 
speaker2: susie!

speaker1: no! no! don't touch me! 
speaker2: susan!...
speaker1: go away!...go away!...
speaker2: talk to her, sidney...
speaker3: talk to her yourself...

speaker1: yes...yes...yes... 
speaker1: steve...is out of danger...
speaker2: hunsecker nods. he already knows this. then:
speaker2: that means a lot to you?

speaker1: but i have to warn you, susie - for your own sake - he'll still do time... 
speaker1: he's a hop-head - that's a felony in new york. i can try, of course, to...
speaker2: a close up. revolted, sidney breaks in:
speaker2: you're unholy, j.j.! you'd rather kill this girl than let her go!
speaker3: hunsecker wheels on sidney, bellowing:

speaker1: listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know i'm telling you the truth! 
speaker2: you're incapable of the truth...
speaker1: susie, there's nothing wrong with dallas! your brother and i arranged it all. and if the leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too! i don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: get out of here! leave this man!
speaker2: he is perfectly controlled, smiling.
speaker2: like most italians, sidney's got a big gift for dramatics. i, however, prefer the cool and stubborn facts. sidney has not appeared in my column in weeks - check that fact with mary. that leads right to another fact: sidney had nothing to lose tonight! to the contrary, dear - only his obvious greed to

speaker1: mind you, not that one true fact didn't come out of sidney's mouth tonight: self-admittedly, he committed a vicious crime of jealousy against steve dallas! now we have to clear dallas, don't we?...but i'll have to sacrifice him... ...to do it. am i doing right? 
speaker2: she is looking at hunsecker.
speaker1: yes or no, susie...?

speaker1: yes, he's sick and you're the only alive who didn't know it. 
speaker1: but what are you going to do?
speaker1: you don't owe your brother a cup of water!
speaker1: what are you going to do?
speaker2: go to steve.

speaker1: ...he's been trying to make my sister behind my back. 
speaker2: kello is in a phone booth.

speaker1: - but it's about time you had a new one. 
speaker2: she braces herself to tell him:
speaker3: i'm leaving, j.j.

speaker1: hi! i just been on the phone to j.j. kello's manner is almost affectionate. he shakes his head, admonishing sidney. 
speaker1: you been a bad boy, sidney. j.j.'s going to write about you in his column tomorrow.

speaker1: i thought he would. 
speaker2: yeah... and another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'... you know j.j....! sidney turns away to look back towards phil. then, taking kello totally by surprise, he wheels, striking the cop viciously across the mouth.

speaker1: susie? are you in bed...? 
speaker1: i don't have to tell you, of course, that i cleared your boyfriend's name; i didn't let you down...

speaker1: i'm getting the mayor to perform the ceremony and - no, i think i'll fly the governor down from albany... do you hear...? 
speaker1: are you listening?...
