ANTON: the secret service agent. offed himself.
SCOTT: ...he was off boffing his girl.

ANTON: he shot himself with a hide-out pistol. 
SCOTT: yeah?
ANTON: who frisked the sonofabitch? you ask them.

STODDARD: number one, the girl's dead. number two, the hide-out gun the agent shot with's registered in his 1020 for the past five years. the man who tossed him has been sacked. his name is none of your concern. now: what the are you doing here? 
SCOTT: sir, i am not here to question...
STODDARD: well, then, what the are you doing here...?
MILLER: sir, as he said, he is here to apprise you of a security leak...
SCOTT: ...and...
MILLER: to call your attention to what may be a problem in discipline with this...

STODDARD: granted. granted. granted. fine. thank you. 
SCOTT: and. sir...if i may...
STODDARD: what is it?
SCOTT: when the operation is staged in dubai...
STODDARD: what is this...?
MILLER: he...
STODDARD: ...what the are you talking about?
SCOTT: i am merely saying, when -
STODDARD: forget it. walk away.

STODDARD: yeah...you're a pit bull. i said forget it. how do we contact anton? 
MILLER: ...anton...
STODDARD: your partner...he's gone to ground...
MILLER: yes, sir...

STODDARD: and, wait, wait, wait, wait, what does this mean...? when and if, any operation is staged which may require your talents, i give you my word... you impertinent motherfucker. what the is with you, you've got on your "thinkingcap" all of a sudden...? 
SCOTT: i'd like to finish what i started.
STODDARD: and i'm telling you to stand down. where's the kid?
SCOTT: is there no operation in dubai...? stoddard shakes his head in exasperation.

DRIVER: ...sucker did the dutch. 
SCOTT: i heard it was a training accident.
DRIVER: nope, he ate the gun. didn't you know?
SCOTT: i've been out of town.
DRIVER: punched out early, off with the girlfriend, his principal wanders off, winds up dead: hari-kari...
DRIVER: ...rather you didn't smoke in here. scott gets out of the car.

BURCH: i put myself in your hands. 
SCOTT: i do not follow you, sir.
BURCH: i reached out to you. i put my life into your hands. i entered into a conspiracy with you. to commit murder. because it needed to be done. i trusted you with my life.
SCOTT: i would never betray you, sir.
BURCH: i trusted you with my life. and yet you cannot trust me. there are things you have not been told. that's right. and now you're all out-of-line, "play me or trade me..." angle, on the two.
BURCH: there is an arab world. to penetrate it makes trying to join the mafia look like a walk in the park. how would you do it, scott? we're dying. we're at war. and we have no intelligence. how would you do it? how would you infiltrate their clan structure? where is the interface? it's at the whorehouse. that's where they go to get frisky, and that's where we listen to them.

BURCH: for the few, priceless hints that we get from that sandpile. had the girl been there, we would have moved heaven and earth - you know we would, and, we would have got her out. she was not there. she got drugged up and fell off a boat, and drowned. she's dead. that man, that man a sworn office of the secret service, went to get laid, and she died. and you are risking the lives of men and women in the field, because you won't take orders. how are you better than him? yes. you had best look sheepish. what the have you got to say? 
SCOTT: no excuse, sir.
BURCH: you're goddam right. now: where's this new kid who got you all bothered. where's your partner?
SCOTT: ...i'll call him off.
BURCH: the you will. you've got nothing to say to him. he's gone to the ground. where is he...?

SCOTT: terrible thing. did you know him? 
MAN: did you know him...? where did you know him from?

SCOTT: ...you know. 
MAN: he wasn't in the accounting office. you knew that...
SCOTT: yes. i did.
MAN: i didn't think, he told anyone what he did. because...because...

SCOTT: a few of us knew. 
MAN: and all he cared about was doing his duty...that's all...that's all... he used to tell me...
SCOTT: i'm so sorry.
MAN: he was supposed to see me that night...after his "shift"...we...his wife...
SCOTT: did she know? his wife. did she know?
MAN: how could she? how could she...she didn't know him... oh, the poor children...

MAN: ...he was going to come to me that night...after... 
SCOTT: ...after his shift.
MAN: ...his shift - yes...
BURLY MAN: ...excuse me...
MAN: ...after, after he'd finished driving him...
SCOTT: ...him...?
BURLY MAN: i said...
SCOTT: ...driving him..? did you say "him"?
BURLY MAN: yeah. it's a man's world, pal - but you're in the wrong bar.

SECOND MAN: ...what the did you do to my friend...? 
SCOTT: ...where are you...? no. tell me later. look: look: forget the boat house. look: yes, tell me in...tel...look: tell me when...get out of there.

SCOTT: what the are you doing? 
BELLBOY: i...i brought you...
SCOTT: why're you with the door...?

SCOTT: why're you with the door...? 
BELLBOY: i took the...i took the sign off... you had the sign on the door. f'they saw me...f'they saw me, knocking on a door, the sign on...they'd... an, i...i figured, you needed... you told me you wanted this at ten...
SCOTT: ...yeah. thanks.
BELLBOY: ...i don't know why you...
SCOTT: you're right, i'm wrong...i'm wrong.
SCOTT: there you go, pal. hold on...
BELLBOY: sure. i just...i just wanted to help.

SCOTT: it's been...quite a while since my last confession. that...that "transpired". on the rear face of a hill, in a mortar attack. and i confessed that i was frightened. and i have to confess, i'm frightened now. 'nother "irregular confession". 
SCOTT: ...i'm about as frightened as i'm comfortable being. and that's why...i involved you. which, i suppose, was shameful.

JACKIE BLACK: now: you did me the honor to call me. now: you tell me how i might help. there in't nobody here, but two people in green. 
SCOTT: ...this girl's alive...
JACKIE BLACK: then, you'd better go get her.

WOMAN: ...terrible thing, grief... 
WOMAN: ...you want to comfort them, but you don't know how. i always think it's better to leave them alone...
SCOTT: a relative?
WOMAN: a psychic.
SCOTT: well. can we blame her...?
WOMAN: that's right.

WOMAN: ...who are you...? 
SCOTT: united states secret service.
WOMAN: guess again, 'cause i'm the secret service, and you follow my directions or i will shoot you dead. spread your hands to your sides, please... open them...

DONNY: ...the pulled the detail off of her...he was in town. her father was in town, they pulled the secret service detail off her, to take him tomcatting. he's been doing it for years. that's what they do. they turn the secret service into a bunch of pimps. he took her protection, she got snatched... 
SCOTT: he'd let her die?
FEMALE AGENT: ...leaving the post...

DONNY: the start of a campaign: your daughter got kidnapped because you were out getting laid? 
SCOTT: her father would let her die...?
DONNY: who knows if he knows. his 'people' would let her die in a heartbeat.
SCOTT: ...her mother...?
DONNY: i'm her mother...
SCOTT: i need some money. i'm going to get the girl back.
DONNY: what can i do?
SCOTT: i need money. i need a lot of money.
DONNY: i've been signing her checks for years.

SCOTT: alright... can you go this high, that's what i need... 
DONNY: ...i...i don't...is there anywhere else you... angle. both look to the side.

AVI: didn't they tell you not to come? 
SCOTT: well, i guess i wasn't paying attention.
AVI: five years ago they told me you were dead.
SCOTT: you want to gossip, or you want to do business...?

AVI: bobby; this is an american girl...? 
SCOTT: if that were so?
AVI: if that were so, why don't your people go and fetch her...? what if i'm speaking for them...?
AVI: ...they send a hitter to negotiate...? my question is: have you forgot your catechism...?
SCOTT: and what's the answer?
AVI: the answer is go home.
SCOTT: yeah, that's a good one.
AVI: ...you're at the big table here.
SCOTT: i know where i am.
AVI: well, then, you better talk to me using the decimal system.
SCOTT: your intel. two men. infil, exfil, hardware, and com.
AVI: and com to what? i cannot give you.

SCOTT: well, you could, when you where in the boy scouts. 
AVI: yes, but i am not in the boy scouts anymore. you heard the private sector?
SCOTT: yeah.
AVI: well. that's where you found me. and here's what it costs.
SCOTT: ...you're out of your mind.
AVI: no, you're out of your mind, and you're out of your league, and my advice to you:...before some mercantile soul shops you. ...for this job, that's what it costs...
SCOTT: ...that's what it costs...?
AVI: that's what it costs you. go home, bobby.

SCOTT: remember me...? 
SCOTT: ...well, i guess you do have friends in high places...i mean here you are home, n'all... and now we're gonna see if you also got all that money that you spoke of. this here's a short subject, if you know what i mean. of you in carnal congress with an underage girl. a prostitue, a minor, and
SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER...: there's another...you know how cheap it is to make a copy...?
BUSINESSMAN: ...what do you want?
SCOTT: i want what you promised me...

BUSINESSMAN: ...i've, i've already made a deal with... 
SCOTT: yeah, but you haven't made a deal with me...so, today is your lucky day, cause you get to do, what most men only dream of: you get to make another human being happy.
SCOTT: you had your fun, now pay for it, jim. get your bank on the phone. we're going to transfer some money.
SCOTT: ..."how about that".
BUSINESSMAN: ...do you know how much trouble you're in...?
SCOTT: yes. and that's the difference between you and me.
