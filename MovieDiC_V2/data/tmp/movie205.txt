LINDA: listen, stace, you want to know about guys? i'll tell you. they're mostly chicken. before i met doug i chased after every guy i thought was cute. i thought if i gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. well, guess what? they don't call.
STACY: so what did you do?
LINDA: i called them. if i was sitting next to a guy and i wanted to sit closer, i'd sit closer. if i wanted to kiss him, i'd just do it. you want ron johnson? grab him.
STACY: i can't do that.
LINDA: face it. with some guys you have to make the first move. a lot of guys are just... wussies.
STACY: really?
LINDA: stacy, what are you waiting for? you're fifteen. i did it when i was thirteen. it's no huge thing. it's just sex. if you don't, one of the other girls will.

MR. HAND: we have a twenty-question quiz every friday. it will cover all the material we've dealt with during the week. there will be no make-up exams. it's important that you all have your land of truth and liberty textbooks by wednesday. at the latest.
MR. HAND: your grade is the average of all your quizzes, plus the midterm and final, which counts for one-third. got it?
MR. HAND: also. there will be no eating in this class. you get used to doing your own business on your own time. that's one demand i make. i don't like staying after class with you on detention. that's my time. i don't like wasting it. just like you wouldn't want me to come to your house some evening and discuss u.s. history on your time. pakalo?
STUDENT: that guy has been stoned since the third grade.
MR. HAND: yes?
SPICOLI: yeah. i'm registered for this class.

SPICOLI: can i come in?
MR. HAND: oh, please. i get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and i don't see all my kids here.
SPICOLI: sorry i'm late. this new schedule is totally confusing.
MR. HAND: mr. spicoli?
SPICOLI: that's the name they gave me.
SPICOLI: you just ripped my card in two!
MR. HAND: yes.
SPICOLI: hey, bud. what's your problem?

SPICOLI: you...
MR. HAND: i've taken the time to print up a complete schedule of class quizzes, and the chapters they cover. please pass them back to the desks behind you... hand begins passing out stacks of purple mimeographed sheets.

BRAD: you hear about the surfer in mr. hand's class? 
BRAD: told hand to off.
BRAD'S BUDDIES: whoa!_

GREGG AND CINDY: hi, stacy.
LINDA: if there's one thing that never changes... it's a cheerleader.
STACY: linda. that girl looks just like pat benatar.
LINDA: i know.
LINDA: actually, there are three girls at ridgemont who have cultivated the pat benatar look.

LINDA: none of them talk to each other. 
STACY: do you think guys find that attractive?
LINDA: oh, give me a break, stacy. you're much prettier than them.
STACY: yeah but they look more sophisticated. you'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
LINDA: what do you mean 'better in bed.' you either do it or you don't.
STACY: no there are variables that, like, i might not be good at.
LINDA: what variables?
STACY: like, you know, giving blow jobs.
LINDA: what's the big deal?
STACY: well i never did it.
LINDA: there's nothing to it.
LINDA: you just have to practice a little first. relax these muscles. think of your throat as an open tunnel.

STACY: what happens... don't laugh at me, but when a guy has an orgasm... you know, like, how much comes out. 
LINDA: just kidding. about 10cc.

GIRL STUDENT: i'll tell you right now. i'm not going. i'll get sick or something. i'm not going into a room with a bunch of dead guys.

BOY STUDENT: you mean he reaches in and pulls this stuff out?
GIRL STUDENT: yes.
BOY STUDENT: like a heart?
GIRL STUDENT: hearts, lungs, guts...
MR. VARGAS: good day, everyone! i just switched to sanka. i'm running a little slow today, so have a heart.

LINDA: hey! that's my line!

BRAD: mom says to clean up the pool. 
STACY: why can't you do it?
BRAD: your friends use the pool. your friends messed it up.
STACY: your friends use the pool too.
BRAD: i take out the garbage.
STACY: don't strain yourself.

STACY: brad! have mom or dad seen this? 
BRAD: they're not home yet.
STACY: brad, what would you say if i asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the cruising vessel and get rid of them at work?
BRAD: i'd say... who the is ron johnson?
STACY: i'll explain everything later.

DAMONE: see that moustache coming in, rat? 
DAMONE: see? you can almost press it out.
THE RAT: i am in love.
DAMONE: you... are a wuss. part wimp. part pussy.
THE RAT: what do you mean -- wuss? this girl is my exact type. it's her.
DAMONE: it's definitely your mama.
THE RAT: damone, you gotta listen to me.
DAMONE: all right... where did you see her?
THE RAT: she's in my biology class.
DAMONE: did you get her number?
THE RAT: no.
DAMONE: did you get her name?
THE RAT: no. it's too soon.
DAMONE: it's never too soon! girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
THE RAT: well, what do you want me to do? go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'hello! i'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
DAMONE: i would. yeah.
THE RAT: really?
DAMONE: i can see it all now. this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer. you bought forty bucks of film and you never even talked to her.
THE RAT: you tell me, mike. what do i do?
DAMONE: okay. okay. here's what you do.
DAMONE: you start from the second you walk into biology. don't just walk... move across the room.
DAMONE: don't talk to her. let her know. use your face. use your body. use everything. this is what i do. i just sent out the vibe and i have personally found that... girls do respond. something happens.
THE RAT: of course something happens. you put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
DAMONE: that's the idea, rat. that's the attitude.
THE RAT: the attitude? the attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. when you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have the attitude.

LISA: were those flowers really for me, brad? 
BRAD: of course.
LISA: how much did they cost?
BRAD: don't worry about it.
BRAD: let's go to the point tonight.
LISA: what's there to do at the point?
BRAD: what's there to do at the point? lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
LISA: brad. i don't want to have to use as a tool.
BRAD: tool? tool for what? we've been going together almost two years!
LISA: i don't want to talk about it here, brad.
TAYLOR: hamilton! you have fifteen double cheese to box!

BRAD: come on in. 
STACY: thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
BRAD: don't worry about it. who sent the flowers?
STACY: it's just some guy i met at swenson's. you don't know him.
BRAD: i don't care it you tell me or not. i got problems of my own.
STACY: is everything okay at work?
BRAD: are you kidding? work is great. i kill at work. i don't even mind mom and dad making me pay rent.
STACY: you're going to break up with lisa, aren't you?
BRAD: i've been doing some thinking. it's my last school year. i'm a single, successful guy. i think i want my freedom.
STACY: why? because she won't sleep with you?
BRAD: where did you hear that?
STACY: i'm just guessing.
BRAD: well... it's true.
STACY: maybe you just need to give her some time. she's so nice, brad.
BRAD: everybody loves lisa. everybody loves lisa. but everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
STACY: hey, brad. are you still a virgin?
BRAD: why?
STACY: i don't know. i was just curious.
BRAD: maybe yes. maybe no.
STACY: you are a virgin!
BRAD: i didn't say that.
STACY: but your face did!
BRAD: are you still a virgin?
STACY: maybe yes. maybe no.
BRAD: don't give me that i know you're still a virgin!

STACY: there... there's his car. i know he's at work tonight. he hasn't come into swenson's since he called my house. my mother told him i was still at high school, after i told him i was nineteen. i guess i should tell him i'm fifteen. 
LINDA: don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
STACY: does doug care that you're seventeen?
LINDA: doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. that's why i'm marrying him.
STACY: if he ever calls again i'll say i'm eighteen.
LINDA: boy i am so glad to be through with all these games.

MR. HAND: c... d... f... f... f... three weeks we've been talking about the platt amendment. what are you people? on dope? a piece of legislation was introduced into congress by senator john platt. it was passed in 1906. this amendment to our constitution has a profound impact upon all of our daily liv....

MR. HAND: how long ago?
DESMOND: just before class, sir...
MR. HAND: okay. bring him in.
MR. HAND: what is this fascination with truancy? what is it that gets inside your heads?
MR. HAND: there are other teachers in this school who look the other way at truants. it's a little game that you both play. they pretend they don't see you, you pretend you don't ditch. who pays the price later? you.
SPICOLI: hey! wait a minute! there's no birthday party for me here!
MR. HAND: thank you, desmond. what's the reason for your truancy?
SPICOLI: i couldn't make it in time.
MR. HAND: you mean, you couldn't? or you wouldn't?
SPICOLI: i don't know, mon. the food lines took forever.
MR. HAND: food will be eaten on your time! why are you continuously late for this class, mr. spicoli? why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
SPICOLI: i don't know.
MR. HAND: i like that.
MR. HAND: don't you like that, miss hamilton?
STACY: yes, sir.
MR. HAND: i really like that too. 'i don't know'... that's nice. 'mr. hand, will i pass this class?' 'gee, mr. spicoli, i don't know'. i like that. i think i'm going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy. giving you full credit, of course, mr. spicoli.
MR. HAND: you can go now.

LINDA: you've got to get used to working christmas. people are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all christmasy. 
STACY: i think christmas brings out the worst in people.
LINDA: i guess ron hasn't called yet.
STACY: not since november.
LINDA: stacy, it doesn't look good for the relationship.
STACY: don't you think it meant anything to him. even if i am fifteen?
LINDA: stacy. what does it matter? he's a stereo salesman. you want to marry him? you want to have kids with him? you want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little pacific stereo badge on? come on.

STACY: i should quit this job. i'm going to get so fat working here... 
LINDA: stacy. how many times do i have to tell you? you are really going to be beautiful... someday.
STACY: thanks a lot.
LINDA: hey -- ron johnson? it's his loss.

STACY: we keep them.
THE RAT: you keep them.
STACY: we keep them, in case the people come back.
STACY: here they are. you can look through it, if you want.
THE RAT: it's cool. it would take too much time to go through all that stuff. i'll just pick up a new one.
STACY: what's your other question?
THE RAT: my other question is... can-i-have your-phone-number-so-i-can-ask-you out-sometime?

BRAD: i can't do that. but if you wait a minute...
BUSINESSMAN: look. just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. okay? please, brad?
BRAD: i'm sorry, sir. just let me find the forms here.
BUSINESSMAN: i am so tired. i am so tired of dealing with morons. how hard is it to...

MERV GRIFFIN: will you please give a warm welcome to... jeff spicoli! 
SPICOLI: 'layin' ladies! drinkin' wine! you gotta dollar -- you're a friend of mine! gettin' loose! feelin' fine! you and me -- it's get down time! we're on the highway to hell! the highway to hell!' spicoli finishes up with a spectular pump. the audience goes wild as merv griffin greets him warmly, and guides spicoli to his seat. spicoli motions for the cheers to die down. griffin is obviously happy to see him. he touches spicoli's arm lightly.
GRIFFIN: how've you been?
SPICOLI: outrageous, merv. nice to be here.
GRIFFIN: i was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
SPICOLI: i've been swimming, merv.
SPICOLI: seriously, merv, everything is great. i was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
GRIFFIN: i wanted to talk a little bit about school, if i could...
SPICOLI: school. school is no problem. all you have to do is go to get the grades. and if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
GRIFFIN: how often do you go?
SPICOLI: i don't go at all. the audience is howling again. he is merv's favorite guest.
GRIFFIN: i hear you brought a film clip with you. do you want to set it up for us?
SPICOLI: well, it pretty much speaks for itself. peter, you want to run with it?

SPICOLI: merv, this is the action down at sunset cliffs at about six in the morning. 
GRIFFIN: fascinating.
GRIFFIN: who's that?
SPICOLI: that's me, merv.
GRIFFIN: are you going to ride that wave?
SPICOLI: totally.
GRIFFIN: what's going through your mind right here, jeff? the danger of it all?
SPICOLI: merv, i'm thinking... i've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.

CURTIS: dad says you have to get up! 
SPICOLI: ugh.

SPICOLI: leave me alone.
CURTIS: dad says!
CURTIS: daaaaaaaad! jeff threw a snorkel at me!!!!!!

CINDY: i just want to say that we are not 'spirit bunnies' anymore. we always hated that name. it bugged the heck out of dina and me... 
DINA: it's just such a put down.
CINDY: they don't call the chess club 'checker champs' or anything like that. we're going to go to everything this year, you guys. we're going to go to soccer, wrestling, basketball... everything. we know you've got a lot of spirit! everybody -- riiiiiight? and we're gonna destroy lincoln next week? riiiiiiight?

BRAD: man, i don't even want to see those guys from carl's again. 
LISA: if you'd apologize i think dennis would take you back.
BRAD: apologize to that wimp? no way. dennis taylor.
BRAD: i'm just glad we're still together, lisa, because i need you this year.
LISA: look, brad, i've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. we're almost out of high school, this is our last year. i think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
LISA: but i still want to be friends.

STACY: you really ought to look at this, linda. there's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. it's like school.
LINDA: why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
STACY: listen to this... 'what are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
LINDA: okay, penis, that's one, balls...
STACY: wouldn't and be the same category?
LINDA: you're right. probably penis, mouth and neck.
STACY: all right! here's another one. 'the most satisfactory occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
LINDA: climax together.
STACY: does that ever happen?
LINDA: no. but it's a nice idea.
STACY: listen to this ... it says 'most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.' linda stops applying lotion, considers that thought.
LINDA: well... they obviously don't know about doug.
STACY: how long does doug take?
LINDA: i don't know. thirty to forty minutes.
STACY: what's doug do in chicago?
LINDA: he works for the airline. he'll be out here. you'll meet him.

LINDA: i think they're both virgins.
STACY: i didn't ask for any help. did you, linda?
LINDA: no.
DAMONE: well, that's exactly why i brought some wisk for the jacuzzi.
STACY: o-kay, you guys can come swimming. but you have to leave as soon as my mom gets home. okay?

DAMONE: hey, linda! i'll judge your dive. i'm a champion diver myself.

BRAD: hi, linda.
LINDA: hi, brad.
BRAD: well, you guys, keep it down. i've got some work to do upstairs.
LINDA: he hardly even talks anymore.

DAMONE: poor guy.
THE RAT: really.

THE RAT: why don't you get up and do a dive, mike? 
LINDA: go ahead.
DAMONE: no. i don't think so. not right now.
THE RAT: chicken!

HAROLD: come on, hamilton. you're going over there to represent captain kidd fish and chips. we have stores all over southern california. part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. you know that!
BRAD: you really want me to put all this stuff back on?
HAROLD: yes. i think so. show some pride, hamilton.
BRAD: i don't believe you're asking me to do this, but okay.

STACY: i can't wait until i can drive next year. i walk every day. it's such a drag. 
DAMONE: get a ride with somebody.
STACY: sometimes i get a ride with my brother. but he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
DAMONE: what a guy.
DAMONE: you know mark ratner really likes you. you like him?
STACY: mark is a really nice boy...
STACY: but i think i like you.

STACY: do you want to come in for a second? 
DAMONE: do you have any ice tea?
STACY: sure. come on in. stacy unlocks her front door, they go inside.

STACY: i guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. are you going to get one? 
DAMONE: i don't know.
STACY: aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
DAMONE: i know what i look like.
STACY: do you want to take a quick swim?
DAMONE: well...
STACY: brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... i'm going to my room to change!
DAMONE: this is great ice tea!

STACY: you don't have to shout! you can come back here to my room! damone doesn't move. he pretends he doesn't hear. a moment later, stacy comes bounding back down the hall in her green bikini. she grabs damone by the arm. 
STACY: come with me! i know there's a suit in the changing room!

STACY: pick a suit. 
DAMONE: i don't know. it's getting pretty late...
STACY: are you really a virgin?
DAMONE: come on... he could feel his leg starting to shake the slightest bit.
STACY: it's okay if it's your first time.
DAMONE: listen. i feel pretty strange here. because mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
STACY: he's my friend, too.
DAMONE: you're a really good kisser.
STACY: so are you. are you shaking?
DAMONE: no. are you crazy?
STACY: why don't you take off your clothes, mike?
DAMONE: you first.
STACY: how about both of us at the same time?

STACY: i want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not. 
DAMONE: let's continue.

STACY: i think we're making a lot of noise.
DAMONE: i'm sorry. i'm really sorry.

STACY: oh. i see.

MRS. O'ROURKE: have a seat, brad... brad have you got your list of college applications? 
BRAD: well, to tell you the truth mrs. o'rourke, i've kind of been putting it off. i'm not sure what i want to do yet.
MRS. O'ROURKE: all right brad. let me ask you like this. if i were queen of the world, and i could make you whatever you wanted to be, what would it be?
BRAD: i don't know... burt reynolds.
MRS. O'ROURKE: i realize it's important to have fun in your senior year, with your friends, but there comes a time when you have to get serious about your future, think about college, and put aside all this fun.
BRAD: you know what, mrs. o'rourke? i broke up with my girlfriend this year. i lost my job at carl's, and two other places. i wake up at 5:30 to work at 7-11, then i go to school, then i go back to 7-11. i have to pay rent, you know. my grades haven't been that bad, and now you're telling me that the fun is over. well, i'm still waiting for the fun to start.

DAMONE: hello.
MR. VARGAS: today we're going to explore how this hospital works to preserve human life. we'll be visiting every floor, every level where these fine doctors and nurses take care of us, in life... and in death.

MR. VARGAS: over thirty children are delivered here each day... 
MR. VARGAS: this is part of your third quarter exam, and i'd advise you to take careful notes on what we're about to see.

MR. VARGAS: may i just ask you one last time to conduct yourselves with the utmost maturity... 
MR. VARGAS: as you know, all the bodies in this room are recently deceased human bio-structures.
MR. VARGAS: yes, randy?
RANDY: who are these guys?
MR. VARGAS: most of them were derelicts, randy. they sold the right for medical examination of their bodies for money. something like thirty dollars, i believe. isn't that right, doctor miller?
DR. MILLER: twenty-five dollars.
SPICOLI: twenty-five bucks is pretty good.
MR. VARGAS: now this gentleman here is named arthur. arthur died from heart failure last week and we are fortunate enough to view his body in its pristine state.
MR. VARGAS: this incision allows us to pull aside the skin covering of the chest cavity and really observe the human organs as they exist in their natural state.

MR. VARGAS: i want all of you to take a look at the chest cavity for just a moment. 
MR. VARGAS: here we have the human lungs and heart, which you can see is actually located in the center of your chest.
SPICOLI: bitchin'.

STACY: i made a fool of myself. 
THE RAT: nobody noticed. don't worry about it. we'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
STACY: what about the notes?
THE RAT: i'll get you the notes.

MONTALBAN: you see, tatoo, what this man doesn't realize is that he must one day leave fantasy island. and he must continue his life as an incurable leper. 
LINDA: hello.

LINDA: i'll bet he forgets to call again.
LINDA: stacy, it's not that sad. it's just david soul and ricardo montalban.
STACY: i don't know, i'm just so depressed. everything is just so... depressing.
LINDA: you have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
STACY: i don't know... i just don't feel right.
LINDA: what do you think it is?
STACY: what do you think it is?
LINDA: it couldn't be.
STACY: it could be. i had a pregnancy test at the clinic. i'll find out monday. i guess it was damone.
LINDA: of course it was damone. if it was ron johnson, you'd be out to here!
STACY: i'm not going to tell him. he's an i hate him.
LINDA: but it costs money to have an abortion. even at the free clinic. you tell damone to pay for it. it's the least he can do. it's the guy's responsibility too.
STACY: you know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
LINDA: what?
STACY: you didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
LINDA: you're right. i didn't tell you that.

DAMONE: what's going on? 
STACY: mike, there's something that's been on my mind and i have to tell you about it.
DAMONE: what? now?
DAMONE: why don't you call me up tonight?
STACY: mike. i want you to know that i'm pregnant.

DAMONE: how do you know it's mine? we only did it once. 
STACY: i know it's yours.

DAMONE: you made me do it! you locked the door. you made me do it! you wanted it more than me! 
STACY: take that back.
DAMONE: all right, i take it back.

DAMONE: there's only one thing we can do. we've got to get rid of it. we've got to get an abortion. 
STACY: we've got to get an abortion?
DAMONE: yeah. my brother art got his girlfriend one once.
STACY: it's already planned, mike. it's going to cost $150 at the free clinic.
DAMONE: doesn't sound free to me. so you want me to pay for it?
STACY: half. okay? seventy-five dollars. and a ride to the clinic.
DAMONE: seventy-five dollars, and a ride. okay.

LINDA: that little prick.
STACY: i paid for it and everything.
LINDA: there goes your stereo for another year. mike damone is a no-brain little prick. i'm not letting him get away with this.

HAND: fine. you sit right here on your bed. i'll use the chair here. as i explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- i don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. i'd rather be preparing the lesson.
MR. HAND: according to my calculations, mr. spicoli, you wasted a total of eight hours of my time this year. and rest assured that is a kind estimate.
MR. HAND: now, mr. spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. now i have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. tonight, you and i are going to talk in great detail about the davis agreement, all the associated treaties, and the american revolution in particular. now if you can just turn to chapter 47 of lord of truth and liberty.
SPICOLI: hey, it's in my locker, mr. hand.
MR. HAND: well, then, i'm glad i remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.

SPICOLI: ... so, like, when jefferson went before the people what he was saying was 'hey, we left this place in england because it was bogus, and if we don't come up with some cool rules ourself, we'll be bogus, too!' right? 
MR. HAND: very close, jeff.
MR. HAND: i think i've made my point with you tonight.
SPICOLI: hey, mr. hand, can i ask you a question?
MR. HAND: what's that?
SPICOLI: do you have a guy like me every year? a guy to... i don't know, make a show of. teach other kids lessons and stuff?
MR. HAND: well, you'll find out next year.
SPICOLI: no way, mon. when i graduate u.s. history i ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
MR. HAND: if you graduate.
SPICOLI: you're gonna flunk me?! mr. hand pauses a moment, then breaks into the nearest approximation of a grin we have seen all year. it isn't much, but it's noticeable. his lips crinkle at the ends.
MR. HAND: don't worry, spicoli. you'll probably squeak by.
SPICOLI: all right! oh, yeah!
SPICOLI: aloha, mr. hand!
MR. HAND: aloha, spicoli.

STACY: where's doug? 
LINDA: he's not coming.
STACY: not coming? what happened?
LINDA: he says he's got to stay in chicago. he says i should visit him sometimes.
STACY: sometime?
LINDA: yeah, like maybe never.
STACY: but what are you going to do?
LINDA: well i might go to dartmouth.
STACY: dartmouth?!
LINDA: i didn't tell anyone i applied cause i never thought i'd make it.
STACY: i can't believe it! but what about doug?
LINDA: there's a world of guys out there. i just wish i didn't have to date any of them.
STACY: hey -- doug stallworth? it's his loss.

STACY: hi, mark.
THE RAT: hi, stacy. how are you?
STACY: i'm fine. mark, i'm so glad you came over here because i want you to know something. i just thought i would tell you that i really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
THE RAT: yeah? about fifty people i didn't know wrote that in my annual.
STACY: i know everybody says it, but i really mean it.
THE RAT: really?
STACY: yeah. i want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what i look like. and so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
THE RAT: well, i don't know, i may be doing some traveling this summer. i don't know how much i'll be around... but i'll give you a call sometime.
STACY: i'd like that.

DAMONE: she wants it, rat. 
DAMONE: i saw you. you had pure attitude.
THE RAT: the attitude, damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
DAMONE: whatever you say, rat.
THE RAT: and... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
DAMONE: sensitive -- what is that?
THE RAT: sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
DAMONE: so what makes you so sensitive?
THE RAT: well, for one, i read. i don't watch as much television as you. i'm trying to feel things more. i'm learning a lot about people.
DAMONE: what do you read? what's the last book you read?
THE RAT: for life. it's the story of vincent van gough.
DAMONE: yeah, well, i saw the movie. that must mean i'm sensitive too.
THE RAT: it's a way, damone. it's a vibe. i put it out, and i have personally found that girls do respond.
