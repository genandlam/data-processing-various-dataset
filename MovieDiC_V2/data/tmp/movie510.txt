speaker1: when you hear thunder... 
speaker1: ...god is bowling.

speaker1: a slow motion low tracking shot of a bowling ball hitting a polished lane. 
speaker2: close-up of the milky white surface of two bowling pins on opposite sides of the lane - a seven-ten split. the rumbling ball is heard in the distance like a furious hulking steamroller of doom. the pins begin to tremble, and then transform into a bridal ken and barbie. the dolls burst into flame.
speaker3: the ball blasts past the camera and metamorphoses into theo's car.

speaker1: i'm an addict. i can't go through a day without the stuff. theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand. 
speaker1: you're not from around here, are you?
speaker2: i'm from akron.
speaker1: you a bowler?
speaker2: i'm looking for a man.
speaker1: what kind of man?
speaker2: a bowler.

speaker1: lane's closed big fellah, league night. 
speaker2: i'm not here to bowl.
speaker1: you drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
speaker2: i'm looking for somebody.
speaker3: hey, ain't i seen you on the tour?
speaker1: no, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
speaker2: i'm looking for buzz fazeli.
speaker3: fazeli...i don't know no buzz fazeli.
speaker1: what do you want with old man faz?
speaker2: some unfinished business.
speaker1: if you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old faz.
speaker4: evening sid, evening breeze.
speaker1: evening tina.
speaker3: good luck tonight tina.
speaker2: you guys got something going on downstairs?
speaker1: we provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
speaker2: basement bingo?
speaker1: yeah, basement bingo.
speaker3: lemme see your ball.
speaker2: let go of my bag.
speaker3: ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
speaker1: you afraid we're gonna steal it?
speaker2: i said, let go of my bag.
speaker1: aagh! stop! those are my bowling fingers!
speaker2: tell your little pal to let go.
speaker1: breeze, give him his ball back!
speaker2: where can i find buzz fazeli?
speaker3: whoa, cool your maples. over the bridge, past the peter pan, last house on the dead end. theo releases sid's hand. sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
speaker3: haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
speaker2: it belonged to my dad.

speaker1: is mr. fazeli in please? 
speaker2: who wants to know? zeus!
speaker1: i'm a bowler.
speaker2: i'm sick of you people. why don't you leave him be?
speaker3: let him in, millie. and don't frisk him.

speaker1: oh sure. let everyone in. from now on i leave the door wide open. let the parade begin! 
speaker2: clam it!
speaker2: hey, rat. c'mere.
speaker1: jerk.
speaker2: sit down.
speaker2: buzz fazeli.
speaker3: theo.
speaker2: i know your face, you're an up-and-comer. you bowl on the tour.
speaker3: i'm not on the tour this year.
speaker2: need some advice, huh.
speaker3: well, mr. fazeli, the bowling congress says i'm a thorn in their side.
speaker2: don't worry about the congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.

speaker1: they suspended me. 
speaker2: why'd they suspend you?

speaker1: it wasn't really my fault. 
speaker2: the american bowling congress hereby suspends theo maynard skinner from all professional bowling activities within the jurisdiction of the american bowling congress and its international co- signers... the ball mashes into the smirking mans head, causing it to snap forward. the judge's gavel bangs and the crowd roars.

speaker1: i got suspended when i was young, too. i was pretty cocky in my day. 
speaker2: they suspended me for 100 years.
speaker1: 100 years!
speaker2: i can appeal in five. i was hoping you could help me mr. fazeli.
speaker1: what do you think i can do?
speaker2: i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. where i come from, you're the king.
speaker1: sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. i'm nothing. it wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the congress. hey, you thirsty? you like orange whips?
speaker2: i've never had orange whips, i'm from akron.

speaker1: he's the guy buzz. 
speaker2: he's not the guy, millie. just whip the whips.
speaker1: i looked in his car. he's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.
speaker2: bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. he's only a fan, millie. i'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
speaker1: you're in trouble, aren't you buzz? you're doing something dangerous in that alley.
speaker2: millie, i know what i'm doing.
speaker1: we should leave this town. i can't take this anymore. i'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
speaker3: remember the finals in akron in '59? you had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
speaker2: yeah, against that vandemark.
speaker3: ten thousand to one, but you pegged it.
speaker2: that game was before you was born.
speaker3: my mom was there. she told me about it.

speaker1: and the irony is, thirty years later, that is bowling in the seniors on tv all over the world, and look at me. ah well. the docs made me stop, on account of my ticker. i don't really miss it, but then... ...i miss it. 
speaker1: orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. thanks sweetie. millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip. theo takes the other glass.
speaker2: thanks.

speaker1: theo brings the drink to his lips. the ball rolls across the room. 
speaker2: the ball rolls into buzz's feet.
speaker2: this your lucky bullet?
speaker2: where'd you get this ball?
speaker3: it's mine.
speaker2: who gave it to you?
speaker3: grace skinner.
speaker2: grace skinner. who's grace skinner to you?
speaker3: she's my mom.
speaker2: who are you? who sent you here?
speaker3: i'm your son. you're a hard father to find.
speaker4: son?
speaker2: millie, please. i don't have a son. i think you better leave now young man.
speaker2: i don't know no grace skinner.
speaker3: you knew her. you married her in 1963.
speaker4: married?
speaker2: you're a artist, that's what you are. you got no right to be here! theo yanks the trophy away from buzz.
speaker3: i got a right. you're my father.
speaker2: i ain't nobody's father!

speaker1: my poor baby! 
speaker2: you see what you did? take your ball and get out.

speaker1: 99 years, 241 days, 15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down. 
speaker2: find your bowler?
speaker1: yeah, but it didn't go so good. he wasn't the man i thought he'd be. theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
speaker2: my father used to say to me "never..." no, hmmm. "always..." no, no... ah! love and hate are blood relations.
speaker1: maybe i should have left the ball in the car.

speaker1: he's not here. 
speaker2: i'm sorry about zeus, millie.
speaker1: this is a sign! someone's coming to take buzz away from me. i don't know if you're the guy or what, but i'm not letting it happen. i'm leaving him first.
speaker2: i couldn't kill buzz. i need his help. theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
speaker1: buzz fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
speaker2: he's my father, millie.
speaker1: he's no father to you.
speaker1: careful with that one. he won't tell me anything, but i know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. if you ask me, i'd say the old fart wants to die.
speaker2: where can i find him?
speaker1: the peter pan.
speaker1: you tell buzz i went to my sister's in ronkonkoma. oh, i'm sorry about trying to kill you last night, theo. it was nothing personal. millie puts on a pair of sunglasses and patches out in a cloud of gravel and dust.

speaker1: hey sheila, how's that orange whip comin'? 
speaker2: how's that orange whip comin'?
speaker1: so, i heard junior busted out again?
speaker1: hey sheila, you can whip my oranges anytime. sheila puts a barbie head earring on her left ear. buzz comes into the diner and slides into a booth. sheila walks over with a pot of coffee.
speaker2: cup of joe mr. fazeli?
speaker3: yeah, and make it extra muddy, i didn't sleep a zee last night. sheila fills a cup. buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
speaker2: you don't need coffee, mr. fazeli; you need a vacation. sheila catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot. she puts a ken head earring in her right ear.
speaker3: some people will do anything for an autograph. theo enters the diner and walks over to buzz.
speaker4: millie left to stay with her sister in ronkonkoma.
speaker3: you know what a mixer ball is? it's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
speaker4: what are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, buzz?
speaker3: you shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old nellie.
speaker4: she thinks someone's trying to kill you.
speaker3: i couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. sheila comes over to take their orders.
speaker3: i'll have my usual please, sheila.
speaker2: buzz burger, side of 'cues. you haven't introduced me to your fan.
speaker3: sheila, meet...uh... i forget the name.
speaker4: theo.
speaker3: theo! this is sheila kastle, my partner's daughter.
speaker2: you look like you're something on the lanes.
speaker3: theo's bowled on the tour.
speaker2: oh, a professional man. what'll you have?
speaker4: what's your specialty?
speaker2: whips...orange whips.
speaker4: then i'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
speaker2: how do you want it? the eggs.
speaker4: uh...over easy.
speaker2: coming right up.
speaker3: watch out for that one. she's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. and, believe me, she's
speaker3: kissed a lotta tadpoles. listen, i been thinking about your problem. i'm not the guy to sponsor you. it would be unethical. but, there is something i could do for you. putt-putt golf.
speaker4: putt-putt golf?
speaker3: it's the next level, the next dimension... ...the small ball.
speaker4: the small ball.
speaker3: it's gonna be bigger than big. think europe. think asia. they don't have room for real golf courses in japan.
speaker4: not for me. miniature golf's for pansies.
speaker3: if the japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. sheila steps over to the booth with their food. the buzz burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
speaker4: maybe i could bowl in japan.
speaker3: i gotta wash up.
speaker5: three whips. to go.
speaker6: when you get a chance.
speaker6: hey, you still here?
speaker5: we're looking for buzz fazeli, seen him?
speaker4: i don't know no buzz fazeli.
speaker6: look sid, a buzz burger. the faz's favorite lunch. sid reaches for the plate. buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from sid.
speaker3: get away from that burger.
speaker6: sorry faz, we didn't know you was here.
speaker5: buzz, mr. kastle wants to talk to you.
speaker6: are you guys bruddas?
speaker3: no, we ain't brothers.
speaker5: you know why we call him breeze?
speaker6: hey, cut it out sid, that tickles. i'm serious! you guys are related, right?
speaker4: he's my dad.
speaker3: get your own.
speaker6: see that, toldja sid. i knew i seen a resemblance.
speaker3: why don't you clowns get your whips and get lost.
speaker5: look, faz, mr. kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you... what was that he said...?
speaker6: i remember, sid! mr. kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
speaker6: your pop said to put these on his tab. sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
speaker5: so buzz, let's skedaddle. mr. kastle is waiting. as buzz gets up, theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
speaker4: i'm coming with you.
speaker3: easy. i got business to do, theo. i'll come back and haunt you later. don't say i never gave you nothing.
speaker4: do those two work for your dad or mine?
speaker2: mine, and they never tip.
speaker4: do you know where they're taking him?
speaker2: yeah, babylon. buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. theo splits.

speaker1: buzz. 
speaker1: you got my whip?
speaker1: lose yourselves.
speaker2: what's on your mind, miles?
speaker1: we've been partners a long time now, haven't we buzz?
speaker2: seven years.
speaker1: this scam we got going here was your
speaker1: brainstorm, buzz. i admit, i thought it was a rotten idea, but i put up the scratch. and now we got a beautiful thing.
speaker2: it's a beautiful thing.
speaker1: a beautiful thing. and you know why buzz? you know what we got? buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
speaker3: we got balance.
speaker1: a partnership is a very delicate balance. but let's say something tips the scales, maybe one partner takes more than his share, then... kastle tips the wire man off his perch. the little motor squeals pathetically.
speaker1: ... oops. we got no more balance.
speaker1: and look at that; both partners go down together. kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. he goes over and puts his arm around buzz.
speaker1: simple math, buzz. two plus two does not equal three.
speaker2: miles, i've always been on the square with you.
speaker1: i'm sure you have buzz.
speaker2: wish me luck.
speaker1: break a leg... ...partner.

speaker1: greetings, ladies, gentlemen. my dentist told me this one the other day: how many bowlers does it take to screw in a lightbulb? 
speaker2: how many?
speaker1: it takes three bowlers to screw in a lightbulb. one to hold the bulb, one to turn the ladder, and one to hold their balls. thank you, thank you. just throw money.

speaker1: welcome to buzz fazeli's dwarf bowling, folks, where we bring you the finest in specialized bowling entertainment. 
speaker2: through a crack in a door theo can see buzz standing in the spotlight.
speaker1: i would like to draw your attention to the top of the lane. weighing in at sixty-nine pounds and standing exactly three feet - the diminutive teeny weenie tina the terrible! the crowd cheers as the spotlight moves to tina, a masked lady dwarf duded up in a combination black leather and cowhide western style sandm outfit. she cracks a whip and leers at the bowlers. they howl with excitement.
speaker1: don't be shy, folks!
speaker1: and - bowl 'er!

speaker1: seems to me like you ain't got much choice buzz. 
speaker2: you're between miles kastle and a hard place.
speaker3: aaay, hands off the tux!
speaker1: the busyboy!
speaker4: get your hands off me, you moron.
speaker4: what the is this?
speaker3: what's it look like to you?
speaker4: it looks like dwarf bowling.
speaker1: very good, busyboy.
speaker4: dwarf bowling's illegal.
speaker1: what are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
speaker2: heh, heh, heh.
speaker4: you said it would be unethical to help me. you call dwarf bowling ethical!
speaker3: i do what i gotta do to survive.
speaker4: you have no right to call yourself a bowler. buzz slaps theo in the face.
speaker3: i'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. i deal with my own i ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
speaker4: i'm your blood.
speaker3: you wish!
speaker4: you knew she was pregnant.
speaker3: what makes you so sure it was me? she coulda had lotsa bowlers! theo rushes buzz and grabs his arm. the two men struggle for the pin.
speaker4: don't say that about my mom!
speaker3: i had a career. she wanted a little bowler of her own. sid and breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. they wrestle theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
speaker4: you and bowling.
speaker3: that's a laugh. you're all strung out.
speaker4: i don't need the stinking pro-tour.
speaker3: you're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. get him away from me. sid and breeze punch theo in the face.

speaker1: hello. 
speaker2: waaaaaaaaah!

speaker1: luna, that's the guy. i saw him do this spooky bowling rain dance on the bridge. 
speaker2: typical.
speaker1: here theo, it's the fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
speaker3: i'm not here to - i can't...
speaker1: bowling block.

speaker1: think he'll bowl it? 
speaker2: nah, he won't do it.
speaker3: weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
speaker2: it's not an "alley". i hate when people call it a "bowling alley", it's so common! i prefer "bowling center".
speaker1: what's this guy here for, anyway?
speaker2: maybe he's here to pay his last respects.
speaker3: someone gonna get kacked, boss?
speaker2: if i find out buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. sid and breeze look sideways at each other.
speaker2: i hired you rent-a-thugs to keep tabs on the faz. i want you all over him like a tent. find out how that little weasel's ripping me off. buzz fazeli's gonna blow the lid off dwarf bowling!
speaker4: i came here to have a word with your dad.
speaker5: what do you want with my dad?
speaker4: business.
speaker5: won't your father help you with that?
speaker4: having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
speaker5: your dad's one of the only nice people in this town. my dad is slime. kastle walks over. theo stands up and shakes kastle's proffered hand.
speaker2: so you're buzz's boy. i've been expecting you. you hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
speaker4: you know who i am?
speaker2: nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without miles kastle knowing about it. you don't mind if i have a word with theo, do you bunny? kastle takes theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
speaker2: i heard you've been having a little trouble with the congress. theo pulls his eyes off sheila. kastle walks theo past pairs of bowlers.
speaker4: you might say i'm at the top of their list.
speaker2: maybe i can help you. try a lighter ball, penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey. i've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. you got fazeli blood running through you. your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
speaker4: what's with the bad air between you two, mr. kastle?
speaker2: it's nothing, just a slight business imbalance. how's gloria's thumb?
speaker6: the blister's worse than last week.
speaker2: no pain, no gain! keep trying the ice. chin up, sweetie. this place is a bowling oasis.
speaker4: it's very...clean.
speaker7: hello, mr.kastle.
speaker2: hello, violet. how's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?

speaker1: you keep that up carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like mr. skinner here. what do you think, theo? 
speaker2: that's some pinfall. almost a 133 average. her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
speaker1: that's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ? now go take out your "big four", darling. come on, we're making her nervous.
speaker1: i get them while they're young. builds loyalty.
speaker3: she hit it, mr. kastle!
speaker1: four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for team kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
speaker2: and the dwarf bowling?
speaker1: think of this business like a big aquarium. you gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.
speaker1: profits down there, philanthropy up here. besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
speaker2: nice set-up.
speaker1: if it springs a leak, it'll be because buzz is making waves.
speaker2: what if he wants to get out?
speaker1: he's earned an early retirement. but enough about losers; buzz fazeli is history. lets talk about your future. i wanna show you something.

speaker1: rac. r-a-c. renovate, automate, computerize. that, my boy, is the future. one of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. the little girl jumps with joy. 
speaker2: what ever happened to just bowling?
speaker1: there's a lot of competition for amusement out there. you gotta adapt to survive.
speaker2: i like the sport the way it is.
speaker1: a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. you got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - pssshht! - shish kebabs. maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good. i think i could help you, theo.
speaker2: how mr. kastle?
speaker1: you need a sponsor; i have influence. i could sponsor you.
speaker2: why would you help me?
speaker1: i like you, theo. you bowl with soul.
speaker1: but, now that you mention it, you could afford me one minor dispensation. theo follows his gaze to the screen.
speaker1: while you're in town, i need you to keep an eye on my daughter for a couple of days. her big brother broke out of the mental hospital... theo's eyes glaze over, the lights in the office dim, and kastle seems to recede into the far distance.

speaker1: ...and i want someone watching out for sheila while he's, uh, loose. 
speaker1: junior's a problem child. he has a thing about -

speaker1: i could do that. 
speaker2: one thing, keep the meat in the freezer.

speaker1: this is a vicious cycle. 
speaker2: i think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
speaker1: isn't this technically a scooter?
speaker2: when i'm on my bike i feel like a wild person. better than any i've ever had.
speaker1: kinda tough on the
speaker2: everything has it's drawbacks.
speaker1: where did your brother escape from?
speaker2: the mental hospital.
speaker1: what does he do?
speaker2: he follows me, he tries to have with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
speaker1: whoa.
speaker2: it's a vicious cycle.

speaker1: hookah? 
speaker2: no thanks, i don't hookah.
speaker1: theo, you ever do the 'swing'?
speaker3: these guys all work at the alley, too. this is john, susan, jon, suzanne, jonathan, and sue. everyone welcomes theo and sheila.
speaker1: dance break!

speaker1: hey man, howyadoin'? 
speaker2: don't tell me, john.
speaker3: cool!
speaker2: theo. howzitgoin.
speaker3: hey man, welcome to our parking lot. lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. somebody blew out junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
speaker2: how's that?
speaker3: i was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. i swear man, the guy thought i was a piâ–ata. if nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. he woulda killed me. guy man, just snapped. how do you like your burger?
speaker2: uh...over easy.
speaker3: i'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. stay away from his - and don't play any of his knock-knock jokes.
speaker4: sheila wants me to show you a few steps before you two swing-a-delic.
speaker2: so, you're the pinman around here?
speaker4: ...and one, and two, and yes, i am. but no one gets them working like junior used to...and two, and one.. - they call him the 'quasimodo of the lanes.' he's the best pinman there is.. and one and two...people used to say he got the machines working so well 'cause he lubricated them with blood...and two, and one...but people just love saying things about junior.
speaker5: mind if i cut in?
speaker2: no, not at all.

speaker1: you and your sideburns are the talk of the party, theo. 
speaker2: the ladies in akron call them thigh- ticklers.
speaker1: can i ask you something personal?
speaker2: i'd rather you didn't.
speaker1: do you have a girlfriend?
speaker2: not while i'm in training.
speaker1: do you have a boyfriend?
speaker2: no. do you?
speaker1: no. not at the present.

speaker1: so this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates? 
speaker2: nobody in this town really understands junior. when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family. actually, he's the only one in this whole town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
speaker1: unfortunately what he wants is you.
speaker2: so, what about you?
speaker1: do i want you?
speaker2: we'll get into that later.

speaker1: theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl? 
speaker2: i don't know. it's all i ever wanted to do.
speaker1: i wanted to be a motocross champion. my folks didn't really care what i did. then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope. most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, i got bowling. i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. i hope i'm not insulting you.
speaker2: no, i'm fascinated.
speaker1: why were you suspended?
speaker2: i used to be kind of wild. they used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
speaker1: so you're hoping buzz can get you re- instated?
speaker2: well, that was plan a.
speaker1: what's plan b?
speaker2: plan b is your dad.
speaker1: what do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
speaker2: he said he'd sponsor me.
speaker1: ha! and what do you have to do for him?
speaker2: nothing.
speaker1: oh really? nothing? my dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
speaker2: he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
speaker1: what? be my body guard? here's my body, theo. guard it. for my dad's sake. for your career. sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
speaker2: sheila, please.
speaker1: come on theo, what about plan c?
speaker2: what's plan c?
speaker1: plan c... ...is me.
speaker2: look, sheila, i really like you but... sheila rolls on top of him, and plants a hickey on his neck.
speaker2: forget it, sheila.

speaker1: come on, junior. everyone's waiting for you, son. the beam of light catches junior's face. he is crouched inside the machine at lane six. jr. his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy. 
speaker2: needs lubrication. lubrication.
speaker1: we're having a party for you, boy. cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love.
speaker2: you made me hurt him!
speaker1: look what i got for you.
speaker1: happy birthday junior!
speaker2: ooooooohhh.
speaker1: i have someone for you to play with junior.
speaker2: someone wants to play with me?
speaker1: i have someone for you to play blueface with junior.
speaker2: blueface! blueface is my favorite.

speaker1: bowling used to be so pure, so...all- american. breeze sings along with caruso and pretends to conduct. 
speaker2: la da da dalala...
speaker1: i hate opera.
speaker2: how could you hate opera, sid? opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
speaker1: how do you know, you don't even speak latin?
speaker2: you listen to the feelings, not the words.
speaker1: you got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was opera.
speaker2: it was a clearance.
speaker1: you know, elvis bowled.
speaker2: no kiddin'.
speaker1: bowling was the most incorruptible sport. no megalomillionaires, no
speaker1: gambling. and it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
speaker2: sure, sid.
speaker1: but not no more. now people take advantage. bowling ain't what it used to be. there's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
speaker2: - canker sore.
speaker1: right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. it makes me sick!
speaker1: how do you turn this thing off?
speaker2: wait! that's an aria!
speaker1: gimme that!

speaker1: theo, i want you to get out of this town. 
speaker2: i'm getting to like it here.
speaker1: did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
speaker2: i gotta survive.
speaker1: he'll be a barnacle on your the rest of your life.
speaker2: you got a better offer?
speaker1: no...
speaker2: i didn't think so.
speaker1: not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
speaker2: that's right, buzz, and you know when i did it? last match, last frame. all i needed was one spare for the crown - and i get stuck with the seven-ten, the fazeli split.
speaker1: you never even took the shot. you couldn't do it. theo moves towards buzz in a threatening manner.
speaker2: i was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. the moment passes. theo turns and climbs into his car. he looks up at buzz.
speaker1: look, kid, gimme a break. i'm an old man. i'm runnin' on a delrin aorta. i'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
speaker2: i couldn't care less.
speaker1: you know what i think? you didn't

speaker1: i don't think your new outfit suits you, theo. 
speaker2: really? i kinda like it.
speaker1: do you talk with your mom?
speaker2: it's been awhile. she didn't want me looking for my dad.
speaker1: my mom told me not to stay in this town.
speaker2: so why do you stay?
speaker1: i'm a credit card junkie. i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. now i'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
speaker2: i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
speaker1: yeah, but they're all little wannabes.
speaker2: i may not be a pro bowler, but i'm no amateur man. sheila moves closer to theo.
speaker1: how much would you charge me for the lips?
speaker2: more than you could afford.
speaker1: come on, bargain with me.
speaker2: i could let them go for ten.
speaker1: you professional men drive a hard bargain. i'm afraid i only have five on me. sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
speaker2: if you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.

speaker1: what are you going to do about your brother? 
speaker2: you're here.
speaker1: what about the guy he put in the body cast?
speaker3: the road is empty
speaker2: momentary relapse. except for that, he's been making progress. sheila laughs. theo nervously pulls his collar up over the hickey on his neck.
speaker2: junior is like a faithful doggy. he loves his birthday so much, that every year, before we can go pick him up...
speaker3: kastle's car appears, driving hell-for- leather towards the house.
speaker2: ...he breaks out of the hospital and comes home on his own. here they come. she hands the binoculars to theo, who immediately trains them on the road.
speaker2: my mom once had an affair. when my dad found out, he had junior kill the man. the body was never found, but i think junior took him to the alley. theo lowers the binoculars and looks at sheila.
speaker1: then it's true, isn't it? about...
speaker2: ...lane six. yes.

speaker1: ok, hats on everybody. 
speaker2: dad, this is ridiculous. just open it.
speaker3: surprise!
speaker1: steady boy, steady.

speaker1: i bet you didn't know that you and junior have something in common, theo: junior can't bowl anymore either. isn't that right junior? kastle slams the ketchup bottle down on junior's right hand. the table settings jump from the shock. junior sits impassively, his face a blank. 
speaker1: see! no feeling. tell theo what happened to your hand, junior.
speaker2: after we eat, dad.
speaker1: he stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. crushed all the nerve endings. junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
speaker3: it's not so bad. when i'm alone, it feels like someone else. sheila grabs the bottle from junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. she leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
speaker2: do you have to get your hooks into every guy i'm interested in?
speaker1: you're just like you mother! always jealous!
speaker2: that's why mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
speaker1: she ran away to be with that... that motocross champion.
speaker3: your turn, theo. why can't you bowl?
speaker4: i don't like to talk about it.
speaker3: you're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
speaker4: it depends.
speaker3: it feels good to let it out, doesn't it? sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
speaker2: you're using theo for your own deviant purposes!
speaker1: look who's talking!
speaker2: leave him alone!
speaker1: just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! i can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that. sheila and kastle sit up.
speaker1: junior, how 'bout a riddle?
speaker3: sheila. knock-knock.
speaker3: come on sheila, knock-knock.
speaker2: who's there?
speaker3: junior.
speaker2: junior who?
speaker3: j'you-and-your-friend do it yet?
speaker1: fantastic! what talent.
speaker2: you still got the touch junior.

speaker1: make a wish, son. 
speaker2: same wish as last year.
speaker3: it won't come true, junior.
speaker1: it's a bowling claw. you can bowl now, junior. with the whole family. junior beams at the group.
speaker1: pretty soon everybody can bowl!
speaker4: hello mr. kastle. junior, long time. i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
speaker5: is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
speaker2: knock, knock.
speaker5: who's...
speaker4: don't do it breeze! you ain't getting us into that.
speaker1: hey, enough fun and games. we have work to do. come on junior. kastle heads for his car. junior gets up and follows. the two sleazeballs tarry as theo stands.
speaker4: if junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.
speaker5: with cleats.

speaker1: buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. sid and breeze throw sideways glances at each other. 
speaker2: no!
speaker1: i want you two to pick up buzz and bring him to lane six. junior will take it from there.
speaker3: i'm gonna play blue face!

speaker1: champ, as soon as you get back on the tour, we should do an instructional videotape. 'rambowl' theo skinner teaches power bowling. you on the cover with a flame thrower. kastle lights theo's cigar and they puff away. 
speaker2: theo, how would you like to be my new partner?
speaker3: you already have a partner mr. kastle. sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
speaker2: i think buzz is retiring soon. in fact, i think he's retiring tonight. kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila.
speaker2: here, bunny. why don't you two go and do something fun tonight, on me. sheila is lured to the scent of the plastic like a junkie to a fix.
speaker2: one thing, stay away from the lanes. if junior sees you two together, he'll swallow his tongue. she reaches for the card and kastle snatches it away from her with a chortle.
speaker2: what did i say?
speaker4: don't go near the bowling alley.
speaker2: bowling "center"!
speaker4: it wouldn't bother you if buzz was in danger, would it?
speaker3: nope, i couldn't care less.
speaker4: i'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
speaker3: why should i help that old
speaker4: yeah, what did buzz fazeli ever do for you?
speaker3: zip.
speaker4: and besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
speaker3: way too late. buzz fazeli is history. too late for what?
speaker4: nothing.
speaker3: too late for what, sheila?
speaker4: you know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
speaker3: you got any broken bones?
speaker4: no, but something's gonna blow in this town. i can feel it.
speaker3: are you with me sheila? is something gonna happen to buzz? sheila seems to be trying to tell theo, but is unable.
speaker4: i can't tell you, theo.
speaker3: why not?
speaker4: i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv. thunder rumbles.
speaker3: tell me, sheila. what are you afraid of?
speaker4: i'm afraid you'll hurt him.
speaker3: it's junior, isn't it.
speaker4: i can't - i can't do it. he's my brother.
speaker3: he's my father.

speaker1: these open the back door. don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. i'll meet you at the bridge. theo takes the keys. sheila grabs his arm. 
speaker1: you don't have to do this. we could just cut out of here, go to akron, or anywhere else.
speaker2: i'll be at the bridge.

speaker1: knock-knock. 
speaker2: who's there?
speaker2: who's there!
speaker1: buzz fazeli.
speaker2: no. i say knock-knock! you say who's there. i say who's there and then you say who who. you're not playing right. knock-knock.
speaker1: who's there?
speaker2: junior.

speaker1: you shouldn't touch her. 
speaker2: no, junior, you shouldn't touch her.
speaker1: nobody touches her. except me. i touch her. sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
speaker2: what did your dad tell you to do to buzz? theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
speaker1: he told me to play blue-face with buzz. i like games.
speaker2: what did you do to buzz?
speaker1: you played bouncy-bouncy with sheila, so i'm gonna play blue-face with you.
speaker2: i don't want to play.
speaker1: to play, i press my fingers on a throat like this... ...and then the mans face would go blue and i should keep pressing... ...and i did and then he stopped moving and he didn't play anymore after that. theo bends back a finger on junior's hand. junior lets out a howl of pain and releases theo's neck. theo gasps for air.
speaker1: you didn't play fair. you were almost blue.
speaker1: go ahead theo, i saw you on tv. i'm your biggest fan. junior offers theo his unprotected head.
speaker1: thank you, mr. skinner! thank you!
speaker1: i can have her,you know. she's not my real sister. theo's pov a ball pops up at the far end of the return and trundles rapidly towards theo. the ball hits theo's face with a pow. black out we hear "raindrops keep falling on my head." theo's bowling shoe attired feet being dragged down the lane. theo comes to and looks down his body to see the empty lane. he looks up to see junior pulling him towards the pin reset machine. the cut on theo's forehead bleeds down the side of his face.
speaker1: lubrication.

speaker1: sheila! where are you? 
speaker1: you told junior that we did it.
speaker2: it?
speaker1: it. bouncy-bouncy. he tried to squeeze my head off. what did you say to him? when they reach each other, they stop.
speaker2: i told him you were my boyfriend.
speaker1: what the did you go doing that for sheila? we haven't even gotten naked yet!
speaker2: we would have sooner or later.
speaker1: oh great! he tried to kill me! you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you.
speaker2: did you - kill him?
speaker1: how do you get this thing down?
speaker2: tell me what happened theo.
speaker1: you wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
speaker2: if he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
speaker1: he's dead sheila.
speaker2: i feel sick.
speaker1: you should.
speaker2: are you sure he's dead?
speaker1: i didn't stop to take his pulse.
speaker2: where are you going?
speaker1: i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz. he gets into his car.
speaker2: can i come with you?
speaker1: i did your dirty work for you sheila, now off. theo drives away leaving sheila standing alone. she watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.

speaker1: buzz? you alright? 
speaker2: don't you knock?

speaker1: hello? 
speaker2: hello, mom?
speaker1: theodore? where are you? are you alright?
speaker2: i found dad.
speaker1: he's dead, isn't he. buzz fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
speaker2: mom, you know i had to do it. i just did it a little too late.
speaker1: you sure you're ok teddy? you're not bowling are you?
speaker2: i gotta go. love ya mom. theo hangs up the phone. alfie shuffles over.
speaker3: did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? i saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. i heard he was kacked but good. they had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
speaker2: the pin machine?
speaker3: just like junior did the last time; lane six. all's i know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. my advice to you is to lay low. he puts on a pair of dark 7-eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.

speaker1: there he is! 
speaker2: bowling police, step back, give him room.
speaker3: nothing going on here, everybody stand back. let him through, ladies. ladies, please. as they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
speaker1: mr. kastle, we know you wouldn't do anything bad.
speaker4: thank-you, sweetheart. see that you pinheads! character witness. they're all character witnesses! thanks to buzz fazeli, bowling is dead in this town! he killed it! the two officers hustle kastle towards the van. theo steps out in front of him.
speaker4: you fool, we could have done great things together!
speaker5: where's junior?
speaker4: he killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's murmur increases. kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
speaker4: lock your daughters up, ladies! junior's out there! mothers and daughters send out a cacophony of screams and scatter for their cars. the bp cops hoist kastle into the back of the van. sid slams the doors shut. the van screeches off, sirens wailing. sid and breeze walk up to theo.
speaker2: sorry about your loss.
speaker5: i should've pegged you guys for bowling from day one.
speaker3: you should probably hit the road. go home. this place could get hazardous for your health.
speaker5: so, buzz was stooling for you guys.
speaker3: you call it stooling, we call it cooperating. breeze looks under theo's car.
speaker2: did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
speaker3: kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
speaker3: she told us you went after junior to save your old man's hide. you got some goin' after that psycho.
speaker2: only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. then he took it out on poor faz, rest his soul. theo patches out.
speaker3: think he bought it?
speaker2: i'd buy it!

speaker1: once my father walked in on me while i was making barbie and ken do it. he freaked. i was seven. he took all my dolls away from me and cut them in half. he gave the top halves back to 
speaker1: me. then he made me watch him burn the bottom halves in the fireplace. theo kneels down nearby and throws a barbie onto the bonfire. it goes up with a

speaker1: i can see junior's face in the fire. 
speaker1: why did you come back?
speaker2: when i'm with you sheila, i don't even think about bowling. theo takes sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. she stops him and looks around nervously.
speaker1: if junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
speaker2: i killed him once, i'll just have to kill him again.
speaker1: you don't get two chances with junior.
speaker2: at least i'll die smiling.
speaker1: and you only get two chances with me.
speaker3: the shirt crackles and burns.
speaker1: what's it gonna be, theo?

speaker1: what's the plan, theo? 
speaker1: say something, theo. give me something. a doll's legs catch fire. theo stares into sheila's eyes.
speaker2: plan c. from now on it's gonna be plan c. both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
speaker2: it's gonna be you, sheila.

speaker1: bowling! bowling is a little like faith. every now and then, we are blessed with the ability and strength to send a full roller down.. ...and scatter those babies like nobody's business. and every now and then we end up in the gutter. buzz fazeli found himself in the gutter of life. trapped in hook alley, throwing nothing balls. but before he left us for that pie alley in the clouds, he pulled himself out of that gutter. buzz fazeli died cleaning up the sport of bowling. now he lies at peace alongside his lane brothers here in bowlers' field. he died so that we could bowl - with dignity. millie, decked out in mourning black, lets out a wail, steps up and throws a bouquet of flowers onto the coffin. 
speaker2: i forgive you buzz.
speaker3: the faz sure took care a her. breeze makes a nasal grunt as he tries to suppress a snigger. sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. sid and breeze approach the coffin. breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
speaker4: nectar of the bowling gods, faz.
speaker3: see ya 'round faz.
speaker5: these are all your perfect games. bowl with buzz.
speaker6: maybe you were right buzz. maybe i did just come here to take it out on somebody. but, i had to find my father... the muffled beeping of "raindrops keep falling on my head" begins playing from inside the coffin. theo's body jolts. he runs after sheila who is walking towards her scooter.
speaker6: buzz is alive, sheila.
speaker7: theo, buzz is dead.
speaker6: i didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. he owes me.
speaker7: back to plan a. the vicious cycle all over again. theo lets go of sheila.
speaker7: i've been trapped by miles kastle my whole life. she walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
speaker7: now he's the one who's locked up and i'm the one who's free. if i gotta do this alone, i might as well start now. she revs up and peals out.

speaker1: why is junior's watch in that coffin? 
speaker2: your time is up, busyboy.
speaker1: who identified the body?
speaker2: the body was identified along proper bowling congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
speaker1: i'm the next of kin. i should've seen him.
speaker3: after we id, we bury the body. case and casket closed.
speaker1: you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place. junior's underground in that coffin you put him in.
speaker3: it's splitsville for you.
speaker1: you faked my dad's murder. you used him! where is he! theo chases sid and breeze around their car. he catches sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. sid howls.
speaker2: ow! ooh! no, please! doc said i'd be back on the planks in a week! show him breeze! breeze pulls a copy of "new york bowler" from his pocket. the headline reads "rub
speaker4: kingpin" with a photo of buzz fazeli.
speaker2: it's official, you're an orphan.

speaker1: what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? huh? 
speaker2: who said anything about an ultimatum? you want to find your father? get a shovel and start digging. hurry up, he's probably in purgatory by now. sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo. he moves up beside her again.
speaker1: you're really me off.
speaker2: i'm you off? i'm doing what i said i'd do. what the are you doing?
speaker1: my word is good, and it'll always be good. when did i ever give my word to you?
speaker2: what about plan c?
speaker1: plan c!
speaker2: your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
speaker1: you think i'm dumping you to get back into bowling. well who's dumping who?
speaker2: i'm not dumping you, i'm suspending you.
speaker1: sez you!
speaker2: my

speaker1: paradise. 
speaker1: paradise. hmmmm

speaker1: you a mini-golfer? 
speaker2: nope.
speaker1: paradise, huh? might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. theo turns to leave.
speaker1: can i get you something for the road?
speaker2: you have orange whips?
speaker1: orange who? not from 'round here, are ya?
speaker2: no. i'm from akron.

speaker1: i just hold it loosely with both hands? 
speaker2: that's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. then grasp firmly. the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
speaker1: grasp firmly. then what?
speaker2: line up where you want it.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: now swing it out a little to the right...
speaker1: like this?
speaker2: no, no, that's too far. try a more gentle stroke. it's all in the stroke. go ahead, now, honey - stroke. as the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
speaker1: strokin'. here goes nothin'.
speaker2: hole in one! you're the queen of stroke!
speaker1: yippy!
speaker3: get away from me!
speaker1: who the are you?
speaker4: hi dad.
speaker1: dad? you said you was single.
speaker3: we ain't married no more.
speaker4: he says that to all his wives.
speaker1: geez maynard, is he telling the truth?
speaker3: don't pay him any mind, sweetheart.
speaker1: you're a nice guy, maynard, but if you got two wives - i ain't into no polybigamy. buzz is silent. he takes the club out of her hand. she steps away - startled - then turns and jogs away. buzz throws down his club in a fury.
speaker3: goddam it! i was just about to make a love connection. you sure got a way with women. you show up, women get away.
speaker4: the whole world thinks you're underground.
speaker3: i am underground.
speaker4: it could just as easily have been me in that box.
speaker3: i told you to get lost. you forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
speaker4: what about bowling?
speaker3: bowling died for me years ago. besides, i'm a living dead legend. i'm a hero.
speaker4: you're a scumbag.
speaker3: i'm a live scumbag.
speaker4: nice knowing you, dad.
speaker3: so, eh, you never saw me. right?
speaker4: i never saw you.
speaker3: thanks, kid. where are you goin' now?
speaker4: i'm goin' straight. no more short cuts. theo gets into the car. buzz leans in the open window.
speaker3: listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me. just make sure nobody's following you. buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
speaker3: i didn't mean that stuff i said. i was trying to keep you out of this muddle. i'm glad i didn't have my tubes tied. oh, and by the way, i made a call for you before i - uh - retired. buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
speaker3: you give ed klein of the american bowling congress a call. tell him your maynard's boy. he's expecting you, and he owes me. he'll getcha back in like flynn. don't say i never gave you nothing.
speaker4: see ya 'round maynard.

speaker1: theo! howya doin'? 
speaker2: theo! hey, theo's back!
speaker3: hello there, stranger.
speaker4: waaaaaaaaaaah!

speaker1: very professional. 
speaker2: i am a professional man.
speaker1: lips still for sale?
speaker2: you bet. for five bucks, i'll even throw in the tongue.
speaker1: can you change something this big?
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: you'll owe me.
