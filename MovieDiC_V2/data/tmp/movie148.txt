ERIN: why are there so many? 
RANDALL: just hold on to me.

ERIN: it's because they're doing this on his birthday. 
GONZALEZ: mr. randall. sir. do you think this execution will bring you a sense of closure?
GONZALEZ: erin. your sister...
RANDALL: leave us alone!
GONZALEZ: a difficult time for everyone involved. interesting fact. it will take about twenty-one cents of electricity to execute alex corvis tonight on this, his twenty-first birthday.

WALSH: he didn't order that. 
MERCER: we found the man with the scar.
MERCER: go ahead. make a wish.
WALSH: get it out of here.

OLD WOMAN: yes, i've come to a lot of these over the years, but this one has many unique aspects. youth of the condemned. that's unusual. fifty three stab wounds. kind of a record. 
GONZALEZ'S VOICE: and corvis still maintaining his innocence.
OLD WOMAN: oh, they all say that.

WALSH: you ok? 
ALEX: what's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. and i'll be seeing her again soon. only what will i say? that i was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? that he's down here laughing?
WALSH: tell her... we'll get him.
ALEX: we won't.
WALSH: someday he'll surface and i'll get him for both of you. i promise.

ERLICH: we couldn't find him. and, obviously, the jury didn't buy it. 
GONZALEZ: some people here seem to.
DUTTON: people here are protesting the execution of a kid just turning twenty-one. a kid who had a tough life. no parents, no dough. always had to fight for everything. it's a tragedy, it really is. but i don't see a single sign telling me alex corvis is innocent.

MERCER: i was facing the hot seat, i'd want my attorney banging down the door of the supreme court, not playing board games. but maybe that's just me. 
WALSH: your move.
MERCER: no. it's time.
ALEX: i don't want you to watch. i don't want to give them the pleasure.
MERCER: ok. c'mon now...

WARDEN: alexander frederick corvis. do you have any last words? 
ALEX: i loved lauren. i still do. i'm innocent.
ALEX: murderer!

GUARD ONE: look at this. helmet melted down. 
MERCER: that, my friend, is a deterrent.

MERCER: get me some backup. we got one loose on the row. now who the are you? alex looks up, sees mercer and flash... 
MERCER: and what have you done to your face there beauty queen?
ALEX: it's my birthday.

MERCER: yeah, well... here's a present for you. 
MERCER: it's ok. man. had me going there.
ALEX: go ahead. make a wish.
MERCER: taser!
ALEX: keys?

RADIO GUARD: unauthorized movement in b five, b six, c three, four, five... 
RADIO GUARD: escape in progress. heading for the roof.

BULLHORN VOICE: do not proceed. back slowly away from the fence. 
ALEX: 

RADIO GUARD VOICE: physical head count shows all inmates present. 
MERCER: then who was the houdini?

ALEX: police? evidence? 
ALEX: ok, ok... what?
ALEX: nothing under "crow."
ALEX: execution?

ALEX: lauren... 
ALEX: what are you, an angel?
LAUREN: i'm your angel. come here.

TOMMY: his knife. corvis. 
ALEX'S VOICE: you lie!

ALEX: you lie, you lie, you lie... 
ALEX: thomas leonard.
DUTTON: what the was that?

LAUREN: your shaolin style is no match for my kung fu. as alex wipes by... 
ALEX: i'm not dead. and i'm not alive. and i'm remembering. and it hurts.
LAUREN: your... flying crane style is no match for my... drunken tiger kick.
ALEX: i can't be alive. not without you.
LAUREN: your... mad monkey... love ... is no match for...

ALEX: i want to be with you forever. 
LAUREN: only forever?
ALEX: what happened to us?

ERIN: dad... 
ERIN: i want to take this to lauren.
RANDALL: honey. i just can't.
ERIN: stay in the car. i'll only take a second.
RANDALL: erin. i know you think she's been talking to you.
ERIN: it's not that. really. it's just... now that he's gone, i think it's time.

ERIN: don't come near me! 
ALEX: i was a friend of your sister's.
ERIN: i know her friends.
ALEX: that locket you're holding. you have one just like it.
ERIN: yeah, no kidding.
ALEX: your father gave them to both of you.
ERIN: and he's right over there by the way. what did you do to your face?
ALEX: someone else did it.
ERIN: you're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? you almost sound like him.
ALEX: he didn't kill her.
ERIN: how do you know?
ALEX: i know everything about your sister.
ERIN: stay away from me! dad! dad!
RANDALL: erin!
ERIN: watch out!

22.: she whips around, points at... alex is gone. 
RANDALL: what were you yelling about?
ERIN: this guy said he was a friend of lauren's. he had like paint all over his face.
RANDALL: are you ok?
ERIN: what's that supposed to mean? he was right here. he was!

ALEX: sssshhh. she's resting. 
TOMMY: where the did you come from?
ALEX: big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator? all possibilities. although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
ALEX: you lied at my trial.
TOMMY: i don't know you, man.
ALEX: capital case nine nine dash c one one five. alex corvis. exhibit a.
TOMMY: hey. i said what i saw. two kids arguing. a guy and a girl.
ALEX: you said you saw me with this. i never held it until today.
TOMMY: what's your damage, man? corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
ALEX: one chance to tell the truth, tommy. who is the man with the scar? he planted this in my car.
TOMMY: there's no scar. corvis made it up.

ALEX: wrong. answer. 
TOMMY: who are you?
TOMMY'S WIFE: tommy!
TOMMY'S WIFE: let him go! let him go!
TOMMY: honey. take the baby. get out of here now!
TOMMY'S WIFE: he's all i got. tommy and the baby. don't take him. the baby needs a father.
ALEX: your baby is crying. go.
ALEX: what did they give you?
TOMMY: they showed me pictures, what he did to her. evidence. said all i had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
ALEX: what did they give you?
TOMMY: a job. construction. twelve an hour.

ALEX: write down their names. all of them. 
TOMMY: you already got 'em. right here. these cops said the needed an eyewitness, or corvis would walk.

TRACY: oh no... 
TRACY: anything wrong?
DUTTON: let's hope not. license and registration please.
DUTTON: what's with your friend there?
TRACY: she's... sick. actually she never had mai tais before.
DUTTON: but you, you've had them.
TRACY: not tonight. honest.
DUTTON: if you had a license, i bet i'd have seen it by now. how old are you? fifteen?
TRACY: look, i'll tell you the truth. jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but i mean... look at her.
TRACY: get up, get up...!

DUTTON: why don't you get out. 
TRACY: you want me to walk a straight line?
DUTTON: i want you... to bend over.
TRACY: look, can i just call a cab?
DUTTON: what did i say?
DUTTON: maybe i'll ask your friend.
ALEX: i want you... to bend over. officer dutton.
DUTTON: where'd you come from? out of the car. now!
DUTTON: hands on the car.

ALEX: question. these hands? 
DUTTON: you're dead, ditch weed.
TRACY: omigod, omigod...
ALEX: you're up.
ALEX: ladies. drive carefully.
ALEX: you might want to call 911. report an officer down.
DUTTON: that was a hollow point!
ALEX: i guess it's true. guns don't kill people...
ALEX: think maybe knives do?
DUTTON: keep that thing away from me.
ALEX: this is not just some "thing." it's a c zero zero five.

DUTTON: you're the skel broke into the evidence room. 
DUTTON: what do you want?
ALEX: a scar. on the arm. of the man who planted this in alex corvis's car.
DUTTON: there's no scar, you freak. the corvis kid made it up.
ALEX: he was innocent. you framed him. you. and erlich. and larkin. and toomey. what do you think, officer dutton? an eye for an eye?
ALEX: you were there. all four of you.
ALEX: you killed her. i saw it.
DUTTON: killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. if she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened. so you're right, spooky. happy?

MADDEN: police! 
ERLICH: you don't do that.
MADDEN: how's the month end?
ERLICH: oh yes. never been better.
MADDEN: where's dutton?
ERLICH: probably parked near some high school with a hardon. never showed.
MADDEN: anyone at all curious why?
MADDEN: you leave the door open with two hundred strangers out there! what's it take for you guys to learn a lesson?
TOOMEY: no one saw anything, mad.

MADDEN: you know why dutton's not here? rigor mortis! he's dead. 
MADDEN: one shot to the head, then fifty three stab wounds with a six inch blade. any deja vu here? think corvus knife, missing from the evidence room.
TOOMEY: since when?
MADDEN: since last night. as usual, you're right on top of things.
LARKIN: it was supposed to end when corvis died. remember? the kid no one would miss?
ERLICH: don't look at me,
LARKIN: hey, i didn't kill anybody.
ERLICH: back off. i mean it.
MADDEN: shut up! erlich and larkin settle down.
MADDEN: crime scene's a clusterfuck. every reporter in town's trying to get a look at dutton's body. i suggest we get a line on this before someone else does.
LARKIN: who'd give a about corvis at this point? kid didn't have a friend in the world even when he was alive.
ERLICH: i can think of one.

GONZALEZ: ... rumors multiply as officials refuse to confirm or deny reports of multiple, multiple stab wounds... 
ERIN: dad! come in here!
RANDALL: what is it?
ERIN: the cop who found the knife in corvis's car.
GONZALEZ: they're moving him now, body
COP: out of here! now!

GONZALEZ: shocking even for these mean streets, the word "daisy" apparently cut into his head by the perpetrator, still at large. a name. perhaps a message... 
RANDALL: what? what is it?
ERIN: lauren called me that when we were little. daisy. no one knew but us.
RANDALL: honey. it's doesn't mean anything.
ERIN: that guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about lauren.
RANDALL: it still doesn't mean...
ERIN: he said he'd prove it.

WALSH: i don't know about any knife. i'm trying to forget that case. 
ERLICH: well someone isn't. they killed dutton.
WALSH: it wasn't me.
ERLICH: no you couldn't get close to him. but i'm betting you know who did. who's into corvis? huh?
ERLICH: not a lot of calls. business slow?

ERLICH'S VOICE: you're the only one gave a flying about him when he was alive. 
WALSH'S VOICE: lauren randall did.
ERLICH'S VOICE: hey. are crazy. richer they are, crazier they get.

WALSH: maybe if you hadn't fried an innocent kid... 
ERLICH: who is it?

WALSH: how about the real killer. you think of that? 
ERLICH: if you're covering for someone, that's jail time. i got my eye on you.
WALSH: alex?

ERLICH: no! 
ALEX: the germans really know how to make a car, don't they?

ALEX: i heard you were looking for this. 
ERLICH: you're the guy killed dutton.
ALEX: i want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
ERLICH: stop the car. alex floors it and... bam.

ALEX: ow. the wound closes. knife still in alex's hand. 
ERLICH: me.
ALEX: what happened to your leg there officer? hunting accident?
ALEX: lauren randall shot you trying to get free. the fifty three stab wounds she died of came from you. am i right? ballpark?

ALEX: in saudi arabia they cut off the hands of petty thieves. what price for a life? two lives? 
ERLICH: not my arm! what you want?
ALEX: i want lauren. i want my life back.
ERLICH: why? why's anything happen? it's all money, man. money. the girl just got in the way.

ALEX: the scar. which of you has it? 
ERLICH: nobody.
ERLICH: i swear. it's a story the loser boyfriend made up.

ERLICH: are you out of your mind? 
ALEX: how can you die if you're already dead?
ERLICH: you're him. corvis.
ALEX: i was talking about you.

ERIN: daisy. how did you know? 
ALEX: i told you, i knew your sister.
ERIN: you killed that cop dutton.
ALEX: and another one. there. erlich. took a wrong turn.
ERIN: i know who you are. that's why you paint your face. to hide.
ALEX: i'm not hiding. i'm right here.
ERIN: you killed lauren! you killed her!

ALEX: not me. dirty cops killed her. dutton, erlich... 
ALEX: i've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. but what you're doing now, does. i don't know why.
ERIN: my dad was right! he said you'd ruin her life.
ALEX: no. listen to me. lauren found out something they didn't want her to know. this.
ALEX: from the bonfire over there. look at it.
ERIN: no! why are you haunting me?
ALEX: because you need to understand. and you need... to be careful.
ALEX: i'm sorry. your father wasn't right. she turns back and...

SERGEANT#2: listen up! yo! we got a cop killer out there. 
SERGEANT#2: til we get an i.d. treat everyone like a suspect. patrol assignments are posted by the door. read them. no singles, it's the buddy system til we catch this sergeant 2 continues under as camera finds...
LARKIN: he knows. i saw him. zombie mask.
MADDEN: calm down.
LARKIN: you calm down.
LARKIN: whose name's next? not yours.
TOOMEY: you didn't testify. you're not on the list.
MADDEN: scary guy. not only survives that crash, but takes time out for art.

SERGEANT#2: madden! hey! 
SERGEANT#2: the old man's requested the pleasure of your company.

SECRETARY: glad i'm not you. 
MADDEN: right back at ya.

CAPTAIN: sit down. 
CAPTAIN: i thought we had an understanding. i thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
MADDEN: yeah, we do.
CAPTAIN: shut up.

CAPTAIN: erlich gimping around in his hot rod is not discreet. i've got reporters asking me how much he made. i've got the entire force looking at this case now. 
MADDEN: i know.
CAPTAIN: you know.
MADDEN: i know the guy leaves a sign.
CAPTAIN: no he leaves a sign. he's a picasso.
CAPTAIN: what else do you know? do you know this?
MADDEN: tommy leonard. the eyewitness in the corvis case.
CAPTAIN: some phoned it in. there was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
MADDEN: guy dressed for halloween?
CAPTAIN: good for you. you do know something.
CAPTAIN: don't say. just do. before it all comes tumbling down.

CAPTAIN: idiots. 
SECRETARY: sssshhhh.
CAPTAIN: you're the only one who makes it go away.

RANDALL: what are you doing there? 
ERIN: i think i dropped an earring.
RANDALL: looks like you have them both on.

ERIN: alex corvis didn't kill lauren. cops did. didn't they? 
ERIN: you're in with them.
RANDALL: it's not what you think.
ERIN: you killed her!
RANDALL: no.
ERIN: stay away from me! stay away!
RANDALL: erin. it wasn't supposed to happen.

RANDALL: they killed her because she found out. 
ERIN: about you.
RANDALL: about them. you've got to leave it alone.
RANDALL: sweetheart...
ERIN: don't call me that! don't call me anything!

RANDALL: i would never hurt you or lauren. 
ERIN: i don't believe you.
RANDALL: please. come inside.
ERIN: i'm never going back in that house again. get away.

TOMMY'S WIFE: please! leave him alone! 
TOMMY: i'm not making this up. he had a crow with him.
LARKIN: caw, caw, that's what you're telling me.
TOMMY: he said i lied at his trial. it's alex corvis.

LARKIN: so we're talking... a ghost. with a pet bird. 
LARKIN: turn down that baby!
LARKIN: get up, tommy. i want to show you something.
LARKIN: you see that? my name's next on his list. it's next.
LARKIN: so who is the guy, tommy?
TOMMY: corvis. it's...
LARKIN: take your time. think before you speak. cause at this point i got to hear something besides the you're been spewing.
TOMMY: he said the whole trial was a setup. that i caused an innocent kid to die. is that true?

WALSH: alex? 
WALSH: c'mon. i'm talking to my myself here. it's humiliating.
WALSH: check and mate.
ALEX: dream on.
WALSH: my it's really you under there.
WALSH: i'd like to say you're looking good, but...
ALEX: two down. two to go.
WALSH: "down?" wait, don't tell me.
ALEX: the cops from my trial. they killed lauren. the whole thing was fixed.

ALEX: you think i'm crazy. 
WALSH: i'm thinking... that explains a lot.
ALEX: lauren's father's involved. he bought the cops fancy cars, i don't know what else. it's a company called d-e-l-t. i think lauren found out.
WALSH: what do they do that they had to kill her?
ALEX: i was hoping you'd find out.
WALSH: yeah. i sure will.
WALSH: boo!
WALSH: what's the deal with this bird. it's been hanging around. alex?

ALEX: this is where it happened. right over here. 
ERIN: yeah, i know.
ALEX: are you ok?
ERIN: when lauren was missing the police came to our house. they said they were looking for her, right? but i know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
ALEX: no...
ERIN: ... is that i sent them here. i told them she came here sometimes. with her dirtball boyfriend. that's exactly what i said.
ALEX: erin. it's not your fault.
ERIN: it's all my fault. oh i wish i were dead.
ALEX: no. you don't.
ERIN: yes i do, i really do.
ALEX: there were four of them.

ERIN: no... 
ALEX'S VOICE: four large men. and still...
ALEX'S VOICE: she grabbed one of their guns. got off a shot, then ran, ran for her life.
ERIN: i don't want to know.
ALEX: she ran. them breathing down her neck...
ALEX'S VOICE: ... all the way from the road to this tree...

ALEX: this tree. here's where it happened. 
ERIN: i don't want to see!
ALEX'S VOICE: she turned and faced them and went down kicking and punching and fighting them, fighting death as they stabbed her and stabbed her. fifty three times.
ALEX: she fought for her life because life is worth living.
ALEX: think about that. and then tell me how much you wish you were dead.

CAPTAIN: why wasn't the incident reported? 
MERCER: nothing to report. all inmates were present and accounted for.
CAPTAIN: so you pretended nothing happened.

MERCER: hey, corvis fried. i don't really see how it could be him. 
CAPTAIN: no. i wouldn't expect you to.
MERCER: be forewarned. nature takes its toll. bon appetit.
CAPTAIN: you lost him! now lay off the doors!
MADDEN: they botched the execution.
CAPTAIN: could say that.
MADDEN: christ. it was corvis. tommy leonard was right.
SECRETARY: maybe you were a little harsh on him.
SECRETARY: babe? she's looking at... t
MADDEN: crow.
CAPTAIN: sign of the dead come back to life.

MADDEN: how about sign of a big black bird? 
CAPTAIN: the dead can return, given sufficient motivation. and corvis has that.
SECRETARY: this guy david jenkins came back as a ghost because my uncle owed him four dollars. followed him everywhere. ruined his life.
MADDEN: time out. you really saying he's back from beyond?
MADDEN: cause if you're losing your mind, i got a right to know.
CAPTAIN: he's looking for something. won't stop until he finds it. sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
SECRETARY: the man...
ALEX: ... with the scar...

ALEX: ... took everything i ever cared about. left me with nothing. 
ERIN: so you're going to kill him?
ALEX: have to find him first.

ALEX: you know what lauren and i were fighting about that night? she had a secret, wouldn't tell me... 
ERIN: my father.
ALEX: all i knew, she was pulling away.
ERIN: i used to be so proud of him. my big deal daddy. and now, he's just a crook. worse even. and the weird thing is...
ERIN: i wish i could hate him but i can't. he said he'd never hurt either of us, and i know it's true and...
ALEX: it's what lauren would do.
ERIN: i want to forget. forget what i know. forget myself. forget everything.
ERIN: keep it. because it connects you to lauren. and it connects you to me.
ERIN: no matter what happens i'll make sure everyone knows. that you're innocent. that you loved her. i promise.
ERIN: i don't want to be me anymore.

CAPTAIN: you know it doesn't work this way. 
NATHAN: i'm out of this.
CAPTAIN: partnerships don't end like that.
NATHAN: our friendship ended when lauren died.
CAPTAIN: do you believe in ghosts, nathan? because there's a ghost threatening us.
RANDALL: you mean alex.
CAPTAIN: i mean lauren.
CAPTAIN: because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
RANDALL: you killed my daughter.

CAPTAIN: an accident, nathan. 
RANDALL: she was eighteen years old! there were four of them. they stabbed her fifty three times! where's the accident?! huh?! where is it?!
CAPTAIN: i watched her grow up. just like you. i know how her mind worked. she kept snooping around because she was worried about you. what you'd gotten yourself into. so stop blaming me. and blame yourself.
RANDALL: i do. every day.
CAPTAIN: erin knows, doesn't she?
CAPTAIN: don't even bother. you never were a good liar.
CAPTAIN: look at this. everything we worked for. you tell me... what are we going to do?

WALSH: it's like a bowl of spaghetti. d-e- l-t is owned by westwind builders, nathan randall's company. but delt in turn owns a dozen other corporations. a big mess to wade through, so i checked out tommy leonard. 
ALEX: leonard, dutton, erlich. they don't matter. i want the king.
WALSH: we're getting there. because in his so-called construction job, tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "the hole."
ALEX: the strip joint?
WALSH: i believe they call it a connoisseur's club. owned by delt.

ERIN: alex! 
ERIN: they killed my dad.
ALEX: it's ok, it's ok...
ERIN: it's not. i can't take it.
ALEX: erin. who?
ERIN: i don't know. i found him lying there.
ALEX: where is it? this place?
WALSH: i think we should get some support?
ALEX: what? call the police?
ERIN: what is this? where are you going?

WALSH: 1315 berkeley street. 
ERIN: don't leave me. please.
ALEX: it will be over soon. watch out for each other.

ALEX: toomey and larkin. they're expecting me. 
BOUNCER: i need to see some i.d., pal. circus in town?

WALSH: we'll be safe in my car. nobody will recognize it. let's move yours in back, no, down the block. hope it's nothing fancy. there's a chop shop around the corner. 
ERIN: you followed me here.
CAPTAIN: no... erin, i put out a bulletin on your car because... there's bad news. and i thought you should hear it from me.
CAPTAIN: your father got involved with some bad cops. on my force, so i take responsibility. he killed himself.
ERIN: how?
CAPTAIN: how did he kill himself?

CAPTAIN: with a gun. is that what you mean? 
ERIN: no. i mean... how did he kill himself how do you figure he killed himself--with a gun, right--when it wasn't anywhere near where you found him?
ERIN: you killed him.
WALSH: erin. don't.
ERIN: back the off! now!
CAPTAIN: he left this. names, addresses, a note to you. these people he was involved with killed lauren. he couldn't bear it anymore.
WALSH: my he's right, it's all here.
ERIN: the note. show it to me.
ERIN: not you! show it to me.
CAPTAIN: it's right there, under that paper. here. look.

CAPTAIN: you were always the stupid one. 
MADDEN: you need help?
CAPTAIN: hurry. we don't have much time.

ALEX: how old are you? 
ALEX: you have one chance to value your life. take it.

ALEX: cheers. 
ALEX: toomey!

ALEX: spark, gas... bad combination. and it's not this leak here, that's the least of your worries. 
ALEX: we're going to play a little game called "who's got the scar."
TOOMEY: what scar? what scar?
TOOMEY: you're him! you're corvis! we fried your ass. you're dead, man!
ALEX: good thing in a situation like this.

TOOMEY: zombie. 
ALEX: the scar.
TOOMEY: there is no scar. i'm telling you.

LAUREN: your witness list is no match for my kung fu. 
ALEX: i'm losing you.

LAUREN: your zigzag love scar is no match for... 
GIRL: did you have to do that?
BOYFRIEND: how about "thank you."
GIRL: he's bleeding.
ALEX: i don't bleed.
BOYFRIEND: and delirious. better steer clear.

CAPTAIN: i hate that picture. 
ALEX: where are they?
CAPTAIN: can i get you something? a glass of water? a transfusion?
ALEX: where are they? last chance.
CAPTAIN: or what? you'll bleed all over my carpet?
CAPTAIN: you know crime was actually down until you showed up, or stuck

CAPTAIN: around, or whatever the you're doing here. what are you doing here? 
ALEX: i'm looking for my friends.
CAPTAIN: see, i heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. how's that going? you find him? yes? no? alex tenses as the captain starts toward him.
CAPTAIN: you are like the guest who would not leave, you know that? and judging from your condition, maybe you've overstayed your welcome. that's not a criticism. just an observation.
CAPTAIN: i don't think you're going to use it. that's lauren's knife.
CAPTAIN: you come in here al lfull of righteous indignation, but what have you got to be righteous about?
CAPTAIN: how many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
ALEX: you sent them. i had no choice.
CAPTAIN: you're a killer, that's all you are. a clown with a bird and a rising death toll. you think the world did you wrong?! you did the world wrong.

LAUREN: i can't say. 
ALEX: he grabs for her. she pulls violently away.
LAUREN: don't touch me!

CAPTAIN: it was one thing her dad rejected you. but when she did you lost it. 
ALEX: you're wrong.
CAPTAIN: yeah? i see doubt oozing out your arm. where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
CAPTAIN: screwed up kid stabs her fifty three times. where would he end up?

CAPTAIN'S VOICE: that's who you are! 
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: you sick look at it!
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: every loser name anyone ever called you was true!
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: are you looking? answer me!
ALEX: i loved lauren. i never meant to hurt her.
CAPTAIN: you see it? huh? did you see it?
CAPTAIN: yeah. i think you saw it.

MADDEN: you were right. picture's worth a thousand words. 
CAPTAIN: just don't believe everything you see.
MADDEN: doubt is a motherfucker.
CAPTAIN: give me a hand with this sack of

SECRETARY: he's cute. was cute. 
SECRETARY: but the face, well, makeup can work for you or against you. right?
SECRETARY: all done. very nice. you're a good listener. the secretary moves off revealing...

MADDEN: so was he dead? or alive? 
CAPTAIN: i've seen birds stuffed and mounted so lifelike you'd swear you saw them breathing.
CAPTAIN: maybe we had a case of that here. get me my kit.
MADDEN: you two are majorly demented. anyone ever tell you that?
SECRETARY: fifty three?
CAPTAIN: in all the excitement i kind of lost count. i think i'll mount him with his head up his ass.

CAPTAIN: grab it! 
ALEX: ... it connects you to me...

ERIN: no matter what happens... you're innocent... i promise... flash. alex painting her face. 
ALEX: all lies. everything you ever showed me.

CAPTAIN: you brought him back. good. he owes you. we'll stick together, you and i. 
CAPTAIN: seen but not heard. they ought to make it a law. erin winces, looks down...

SECRETARY: sitting on the floor, painting her own toenails blue, leaning up against the wall. 
ALEX: where'd they go?
SECRETARY: my nails.

82.: the captain's footsteps audible. 
CAPTAIN: i know you too well. you won't do it.
ERIN: you don't know me at all.

ALEX'S VOICE: the jolt, eight amps at two to three thousand volts. it lasts a few seconds. the current surges and is turned off. 
ALEX'S VOICE: they wait for the body to cool, then check to see if the heart is still beating.
ALEX'S VOICE: if it is... ba-boom, ba-boom... another jolt is applied.
ALEX'S VOICE: experts say unconsciousness occcurs before pain has time to register. they agree electrocution does not "hurt," could not hurt. but it does. unimaginably. believe me. we're in the death chamber. dark. claustrophobic.

ALEX: i don't expect a call from the governor. any last words? captain, my captain? 
CAPTAIN: yeah. you.
ALEX: was that it? well, ok.
CAPTAIN: i'm not dying for your illusions. you got that? you think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? she was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? you're nothing, corvis! less than nothing.
CAPTAIN: you can't do this to me you little fucks! i'll come back, just like you, a big spewing bird and three guesses what little i'm taking out first...
ERIN: you are so dead.

ERIN: you want to get some breakfast? what i mean is... i don't know how this works, but... 
ERIN: in the woods you said you had nothing. but you wouldn't, and i wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. please. at least not right away.
ALEX: erin. i'll always be with you. for a split second, she's...
ERIN: alex. look at this.
ERIN'S VOICE: in that moment when alex went... wherever he went... when he made that choice, i knew i was making a choice too. to be alive. in the world. and it made me cry.

ERIN'S VOICE: when i think of lauren fighting and dying, it tears me apart, but it also reassures me. that lauren and alex were meant for each other. 
ERIN'S VOICE: that they're together now. fighters. united by love. and anger. that they've given also to me. she's leaning up against a new headstone.
