KELLY: ...my dad was anorexic. 
CHARLOTTE: really?
KELLY: he was on the american side at the bay of pigs, in cuba, and he was taken prisoner, and they tortured them about their food the whole time.
BENZO: where?
KELLY: my dad fought on the american side at the bay of pigs. so, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up... and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. he has to have really clean food. and really simple. he can't just go have, say, chinese food.
JOHN: oh, that's too bad.
BENZO: how crazy is this
CHARLOTTE: yeah, it is.
KELLY: ...oh my you have to try it, this power cleanse is amazing- it's lemon juice and grade b maple syrup and cayenne pepper for seven days. just like a half a teaspoon of cayenne. the first few days you're a little scattered, but by day four - it's amazing... my eyes were so white... charlotte excuses herself.
CHARLOTTE: hi again, how's it going?
BOB: who do i have to to get off this planet?

CHARLOTTE: ok, bye.

CHARLOTTE: ouch. 
JOHN: at the fitting, they had all these rock n roll clothes, the label guys kept saying lock n loll, though, but the band doesn't look tough at all...they look better just skinny and nerdy, like how when they came in...they looked so uncomfortable in these keith richards clothes, they should just be like they are, don't you think?
CHARLOTTE: yeah.
JOHN: yeah, i think you're probably right... because when you try to...
CHARLOTTE: do you think it's done?
JOHN: i don't know. he goes to get all his stuff together.
JOHN: will you please stop smoking?
CHARLOTTE: but i like to... and i don't smoke that much.
JOHN: its bad for you.
CHARLOTTE: ok, i will... later.
JOHN: a soul's search: finding your true character and calling? is this yours?
CHARLOTTE: oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.

CHARLOTTE: charlie, this is bob. bob â— charlie brown. 
BOB: hi, charlie.
CHARLOTTE: his real name's hayashi, but someone started calling him charlie because they thought he looked like charlie brown. they've all got american nicknames because its easier for me to remember... they were just out in l.a. last month doing a shoot with john... that guy's mr.valentine, he's the art director of their magazine, i don't even know his real name, or why i call him that.
CHARLIE: this is bambi.
CHARLOTTE: hi.

BOB: i know. i don't either.

BOB: lydia? 
LYDIA: hello, darling.
BOB: lydia, i went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
LYDIA: oh, yeah? i wish i had seen it.
BOB: he was this fashion guy, and there were all these japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and i was talking to these japanese surfers... he was playing all this great music- i have to find out what it was...
LYDIA: that sounds great â— can you hold on... what zoe?
ZOE: i don't want it.
LYDIA: well, you have to have something for breakfast. do you want cereal?
ZOE: no.

CHARLOTTE: do you want to have some breakfast?
BOB: yeah, i'm going to take a shower and i'll meet you downstairs.
CHARLOTTE: ok, see you downstairs.

CHARLOTTE: hey look, it's sausalito. 
BOB: i see them every morning.

BOB: hans was very attentive to you. 
CHARLOTTE: i think he kind of liked me...is that so hard to imagine?
BOB: no, its easy.
CHARLOTTE: how'd a japanese guy get a name like hans?
BOB: i don't know.
CHARLOTTE: do you remember when we met at the bar? ...you were wearing a tuxedo.
BOB: but the first time i saw you was in the elevator.
CHARLOTTE: really?
BOB: yeah, you don't remember?
CHARLOTTE: did i scowl at you?
BOB: no, you smiled.
CHARLOTTE: i don't remember.
BOB: i know, i kind of blend in here.

CHARLOTTE: why do they switch the r's and l's here? 
BOB: i don't know. my fax said "have a good fright".
CHARLOTTE: let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
BOB: ok, whatever you want.
CHARLOTTE: did you see hiromix last night dancing with bambi?
BOB: no, i was looking at you.
CHARLOTTE: oh. well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird english guy who kept talking about hanging out with the pistols on kings road...
BOB: i got a fax today from your friend hiromix.
CHARLOTTE: oh, for her show?
BOB: no, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
CHARLOTTE: oh.
BOB: you're possessive.
CHARLOTTE: i know.

CHARLOTTE: i'm stuck. does it get easier. 
BOB: no, yes, it does...
CHARLOTTE: yeah? but look at you.
BOB: thanks. it does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
CHARLOTTE: i just don't know what i'm supposed to be. i thought maybe i wanted to be a writer... but i hate what i write, and i tried taking pictures, but john's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know pictures of your feet...
BOB: you'll figure it out. i'm not worried about you. keep writing.
CHARLOTTE: but, i'm mean.
BOB: that's ok.
CHARLOTTE: and marriage, does that get easier?
BOB: it's hard. we started going to a marriage counselor.
CHARLOTTE: did that help? did you learn anything?
BOB: we established that we have no communication.
CHARLOTTE: oh.
BOB: we used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. she never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, i feel like i'm in the way. it gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
CHARLOTTE: that's too scary.
BOB: when they're born its like vietnam. it's terrifying.
CHARLOTTE: no one ever tells you that...
BOB: but, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
CHARLOTTE: that's nice. my parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
BOB: where'd you grow up?
CHARLOTTE: in d.c., my dad was the ambassador to france in the eighties, so we went to school in paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in d.c., and they were never around... and then i moved to los angeles when john and i got married... it's so different there.
BOB: i know.
CHARLOTTE: john thinks i'm so snotty.
BOB: you are.
CHARLOTTE: i know, but that's what you like about me.
CHARLOTTE: why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
BOB: because that would be too easy.

BOB: hello? 
RECEPTION: mr. harris, we have fax for you!

BOB: what happened to your toe?
CHARLOTTE: i don't know, i think maybe i broke it? i knocked into something the other day...
BOB: that doesn't look good.
CHARLOTTE: it's bad isn't it?
BOB: we should get you to the doctor.
CHARLOTTE: you think so?
BOB: yeah, look at that thing.

CHARLOTTE: working.
BOB: do you ever see him?
CHARLOTTE: yeah.
BOB: do you know where we are?
CHARLOTTE: no.
CHARLOTTE: isn't it weird there are no street names in tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs...

TV HOST: we hear you're quite a golfer. 
TRANSLATOR: they now have the competition for you with the iron chef.

BOB: no, we'll find something around here.

CHARLOTTE: the jazz singer? the red-head? 
CHARLOTTE: well, i guess she's more around your age... you guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
BOB: you're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention? she scowls at him.
CHARLOTTE: i can't tell the difference?
BOB: we'll have two of these.
BOB: what do you want to drink?
CHARLOTTE: a coke.
BOB: so, where'd you go today.
CHARLOTTE: around.

BOB: i don't want to go back tomorrow.
CHARLOTTE: i know. but, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
BOB: why can't it last?
CHARLOTTE: i don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a jazz band.
SINGER: somethings that happen for the first time, seem to be happening again and so it seems we have met before, and laughed before, and loved before, but who knows where or when...
