speaker2: there's a killer on the road his brain is squirming like a toad take a long holiday let your children play if you give this man a ride sweet family will die there's a killer on the road the boy's eyes going back to the indian man looking at him... then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on the asphalt... the dying man's face, twisted, moaning, amazing eyes at the point of death -- they settle on jim
speaker1: it's just a dream jimmy, just a dream
speaker3: ...the reaction i get now looking back is the soul of the ghosts of those dead indians -- maybe one or two of them were just running around freaking out and just leaped into my soul -- and they're still there.

speaker2: have you ever seen god? -- a mandala. a symmetrical angel. felt? yes. the sun. heard? the music. voices. touched? an animal. your hand tasted? rare meat, corn, water and wine
speaker3: hey man it's great, don't listen to em, it's non-linear man, it's poetry man, everything godard stands for.
speaker4: this is pretty shocking stuff mr. morrison. and i might say indulgent. naziism and masturbation, when used for shock value, are not art. but to be constructive, let's start with your intention. what was it?
speaker5: it was a bore!! that's what!
speaker6: hey it was better'n a warhol picture.
speaker7: no it wasn't. it was worse!
speaker6: a guy sleeping for seven hours...
speaker8: ...is less pretentious! there was no political consciousness. naziism is...
speaker9: hey hold on man! you guys are the facists!
speaker10: it takes genitalism to absurdity man, just cause the squares here can't dig it cause the film school's still so square...
speaker11: oh c'mon man, give it a break. boo! beatniks go home! take another mushroom...
speaker4: hold it down!!... mr. morrison -- what are your feelings?
speaker12: i quit.

speaker1: hey man whatdya expect, an oscar? 
speaker2: you can't quit, you gotta voice. people can't dig cause they don't understand yet.
speaker3: if you're an individual, if you're too good, they wanna cut your off. look what happened to orson wells.
speaker1: you quit now, they'll yank your deferment in no time and they'll get you for vietnam man. three more months you graduate.
speaker2: be cool, you never learned patience morrison, you want everything at once.
speaker4: they didn't get it. so make your films and what they think.
speaker5: you know what i think?
speaker2: yeah whadday you think?
speaker5: you really want to know what i think?
speaker2: yeah yeah, whatddaya think?
speaker5: i think we gotta get really ripped!

speaker1: i tell you bout my baby 'bout five foot four from head to toe she came to my room just 'bout midnight she makes me feel so good she makes me feel alright 
speaker2: you know what i'd like to do to you?
speaker3: no what?
speaker2: you really want to know what i'd like to do to you?
speaker3: what!
speaker2: wanna hear the scream of the butterfly...
speaker4: hey morrison!
speaker2: she came to my room she came on my floor she came on my bed she came on my face ooooooh i want to wrap your legs around my head baby baby and her name was gloria

speaker1: awake! 
speaker1: come on, come out for a walk, it's a pretty night.
speaker2: you're crazy!

speaker1: can i stay with you tonight? we could talk 'till dawn. i just don't want to be alone. 
speaker2: okay... just talk though. no funny stuff.
speaker1: okay. i promise.
speaker2: i've been real upset. i lost my car on the freeway yesterday. i left it somewhere and i can't remember where and when i went back it was gone. my sister...
speaker1: i bet you never expected life could be this hard. and you're still so young.
speaker1: i wonder where we'll be ten years from now?
speaker2: i really don't want to know
speaker1: come on.
speaker1: choose now, they croon beneath the moon beside an ancient lake enter again the sweet forest enter the hot dream come with us everything is broken up and dances

speaker1: these are like beautiful! i never read much poetry in school. i hated it. what's a "shaman"? 
speaker2: he's the medicine man who starts in a peyote trance. and he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his vision and it heals them. it's the same in all cultures -- greeks, some indians say the first shaman invented sex. he's the one who makes you crazy.
speaker1: are you a "shaman"?
speaker2: uh no. i just write about it. what turns you on?
speaker1: i don't know. experience. freedom. love... now. peyote's like love. when it's given it's blessed. when it's sold it's i like peyote. i like acid, it's easier to get. i like the spiritual voyage. the first time i did acid i saw i did. i had a friend who was christ. and he was judas too. i suddenly knew the secret of everything -- that we're all one, the universe is one. and that everything is beautiful.
speaker2: is it? i don't know. i think you're alive by confronting death -- by experiencing pain.
speaker1: i think you're alive by recognizing beauty -- seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is... we're all saying the same thing. it's "love me and i'll love you."
speaker2: it's only thru death that you know life. medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life.
speaker1: do you love death?
speaker2: i think life hurts a lot more than death. when you die the pain is over.
speaker1: why do i look at you... and see my death? no, that's ridiculous.
speaker2: i bet your dad's a school teacher.
speaker1: how did you know!
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: what was your father?
speaker2: military
speaker1: i bet you moved around a lot.
speaker2: yeah, about 8 times.
speaker1: how many sisters and brothers?
speaker2: two.
speaker1: one... she's the pretty one... i love your neck.
speaker2: "...but one, the most beautiful one of all dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug"
speaker1: that's beautiful. who did you write it for?
speaker2: i wrote it for you.
speaker1: ...take your time, jim... there's no hurry, i'm all you have to do tonight...
speaker3: well the clock says it's time to close now i guess i'd better go now... as we depart the rooftop. your fingers weak with minarets speaking secret alphabets i light another cigarette

speaker1: om om... no bliss! no bliss! 
speaker2: hey ray, try acid man, it's guaranteed.
speaker1: morrison... aw last trip i thought i was going through hell's digestive system. something painted by hieronymus bosch.
speaker2: i never had a bummer on acid.
speaker1: i like naturally high man.
speaker2: whatever works. making movies at mgm yet?
speaker1: well i saw the head of production and i said godard doesn't use scripts, he improvises with his camera and he said, "great who's godard?"
speaker2: we gotta take the planet back, reinvent the gods, make new myths.
speaker1: right on. i thought you went to new york?
speaker2: never got there. went out to the desert and uh... got lost y'know. days. i been living on trick's rooftop. got stuck on this chick...
speaker1: whatcha been doing?
speaker2: writing. poems. songs.
speaker1: songs? lemme hear one.
speaker2: i can't sing.
speaker1: so neither can dylan. "johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine, i'm on the pavement thinking about the government". but he's got the words man. that's what they want.
speaker2: let's swim to the moon un hunh let's climb thru the tide penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide
speaker2: let's swim out tonight love it's our turn to try parked beside the ocean on our moonlight drive
speaker1: wow!... y'know man those are hot lyrics -- really hot!
speaker2: ...could you write the music for that down, if we went over to your place, could you write that on your organ?
speaker1: are you kidding! i could fly. you wrote that? you got others?
speaker2: a bunch. it's like i'm taking notes at a rock concert going on inside my head. i actually hear the music -- the spirit of the wine y'know, intoxication.
speaker1: man. you got a voice like chet baker -- haunted! what the happened to you in the desert? let's get a rock and roll band together man and make a million bucks.
speaker2: ...be great wouldn't it?
speaker1: it's the perfect time man! two of the guys outta my band are really into this. i meditate with them. you know them... robbie and john. we could have it in the can in three weeks.
speaker2: hey why not, i could write the songs with you guys.
speaker1: the stones did it outta the london school of economics for chrissake. things are about to explode man. you can feel it in the air. vietnam's right out there. sides are being chosen. people wanna fight or love or kill, everything's gonna flame. the planet's screaming for change, morrison. make the myths man!!
speaker2: there oughta be great orgies man. like when dionysus arrived in greece, he made all the women mad, leaving their homes and dancing off in the mountains. great golden copulations in the streets of la. hey, do you know her?
speaker1: what do we call ourselves. "dionysus"?
speaker2: i got a name.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: the doors.
speaker1: the doors? that's the most ridiculous... ...you mean the doors in your mind? like the huxley book.
speaker2: "the doors of perception"? acid...
speaker1: yeah sure mescaline experiments -- reducing the sugar flow to the brain. great book.
speaker2: it's from william blake actually, the line -- "when the doors of perception are cleansed -- things will appear as they truly are..."
speaker1: -- infinite". it's great, jim.
speaker2: so where do we start? how do we start? where are the girls?
speaker1: rehearsing. you're moving off the rooftop and in with me and dorothy.
speaker3: let's swim to the moon let's climb thru the tide penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide...

speaker1: the day destroys the night night divides the day tried to run tried to hide break on thru to the other side 
speaker2: that's really square. let's hip it up. jump on your cues.
speaker3: tighten it up. stay with the beat jim. you're dragging.
speaker4: let's try it again, come on. i'm just getting into it.
speaker5: i think it's hot!!
speaker6: i still think the lyrics are weird man.
speaker2: i still think it sounds like the bottom of a fishbowl man.
speaker6: i been working on something goes like this... a minor. "you know that it would be untrue you know that i would be a liar if i was to say to you girl, we couldn't get much higher" sharp... chorus "come on baby, light my fire try to set the night on fire..."
speaker3: okay man there's some good changes in there.
speaker4: got any more lyrics?
speaker6: some. i call it "light my fire". i figger if i'm gonna compete with your stuff it's gotta be about earth, fire or snakes.
speaker4: don't underestimate death.
speaker2: yeah but it sounds like the byrds man, we're not folk rock man. how 'bout trying it with a latin beat.
speaker6: i thought we could do the usual verse chorus verse chorus and
speaker2: we don't need a bridge.
speaker6: yeah, we could maybe improvise a couple piano and guitar solos over it "the time to hesitate is through" du du duh dud dada . . .
speaker4: "no time to wallow in the mire try now we can only lose and our love become a funeral pyre come on baby light my fire" john drumming it, different, more latin.
speaker4: pretty good! pretty neat!!
speaker3: nice groove, john. chaka chaka chaka, then bula burump bula ...you're right, it could take a coupla long solos, that's wild man, like butterfield did on "east-west" -- really hip.
speaker6: y'ever heard coltrane's "favorite things"?
speaker2: yeah -- maybe stretch it out and put it in 4/4 on bass, 3/4 on guitar and snare.
speaker3: why not! a minor to b minor. jazz! that then is jazz! but it needs a hook. something. give me some space. i need some space. leave the room guys. come on! go!

speaker1: guy's obnoxious, man always bossin' people around! i thought we were equals! 
speaker2: aren't we? that was great robbie. whaddaya thinking about when you play?
speaker3: don't know. mostly the fish in my fish tank.
speaker2: hey whadya say we take some of that tijuana acid and see what kinda trouble we can get into tonight?
speaker3: the chicks always go for you man. i get the dogs.
speaker2: then we'll start a religion or plan a murder or go to tijuana.
speaker1: whatsamatter with you man, what about pam, you got the morals of a coyote.
speaker2: why you wanna sleep with her john, just to bug me?
speaker1: no!
speaker2: ...means "hell yes". she likes you man, she really does and y'all should. what's a rock and roll band for man, if you can't party all night and do bad things?

speaker1: sieg heil! 
speaker2: okay here it is. bach and rock. count it off john

speaker1: you know that it would be untrue etc.

speaker1: so jerry... do we get paid for this? 
speaker2: what "day destroys the night", "crawl back in your brain", "go insane". what do people wanna pay money to hear that
speaker3: the greater the suffering, the more terrible the events, the greater the pleasure jerry. they want it, it's catharsis. like the ancient greeks.
speaker2: we're in los angeles punk, how would you know, they like your pants, they're not listenin' to you, what the they see in you i...
speaker3: but they understand jerry. all our real desires are unconscious and unseen. . .

speaker5: yeah right, but what about the music?
speaker4: hey the music? i love it man, that's why we're talking right? some of it's a little on the dark side though. ya know ya oughta get some tunes like herman's hermits stuff -- "mrs. brown you got a lovely daughter". that goes right to the radio man.
speaker5: uh huh. well, how 'bout gettin' us some real equipment?
speaker4: listen, i sign you guys to a five year management contract and you got it all. equipment. demo. a truck with roadies. three, maybe four percent record deal. wherever ya want to go babe, trust me, i'll get you there. whatd'ya say?

speaker1: ...make sure you get barb and sue anne to come. and tell them to ask for jim!
speaker4: jim, how old are you?
speaker3: ah, twenty one...
speaker4: you're a gold mine, i'll make it quick and to the point and if you repeat it i'll deny it -- drop these guys, i'll put you with some real musicians, your voice, your looks, that's what'll sell records, we'll make a million bucks. a year. goodbye. call me. i'm right. he gives jim a card and goes. pam disgusted with the type, jim laughs, likes the guy.
speaker3: i like a man wears his soul on his face.
speaker5: "whiskey's" next, i can feel it in my bones.

speaker1: we must kiss the snake on the tongue, if it senses our fear, it will eat us instantly. but if we kiss it without fear, the snake will take us through the garden and out the gate. to our freedom -we must ride this snake. to the end of time.
speaker2: i think i'm up. i'm not thinking right.

speaker10: it's only a word man. the stones changed...
speaker2: hey ray, why don't you change your name to sid or irving manzarek or something... it's only a word y'know.
speaker11: it's my words. i don't care, let's just jam.
speaker6: now here on our stage direct from los angeles, california, ladies and gentlemen, the doors!
speaker12: you know that it would be untrue you know that i would be a liar if i was to say to you girl, we couldn't get much higher come on baby light my fire
speaker5: he said it! he said it! on national tv you can't do that! you can't do that!!! you blew it you little you'll never play ed sullivan again. jim on the monitors, singing through to his freedom, falls on the floor flat, the camera missing him completely.
speaker2: come on baby, light my fire try to set the night on fiiiirrrrre!

speaker1: what can i do, what do you want me to do?... jim? 
speaker2: i don't know... i guess i should see a doctor or something... maybe i should go to someone of the straight jungian philosophy.
speaker1: it happens to other guys too...
speaker2: it's so scary up there. to be adored. isn't that irony? teenage death girls want my -- a mere clown -- not my words. i'll never wake up in a good mood again... lament for my cock, a tongue of knowledge deep in the feathered night, gives life, soar and crucify, i seek to know you...
speaker1: it's not so complicated jim, it's just sex, y'know.
speaker2: you should marry an insurance salesman.
speaker1: it's the hours man, the pressure, everything's like your last performance, you're setting yourself up.
speaker2: we weren't built to last.
speaker1: aren't you doing this for you, because you're a poet, not a rock star. ed sullivan's not a place for you.
speaker2: you really know what i am pam? you know what poetry is? where is the feast they promised us? where is the wine -- the new wine -- dying on the vine?
speaker1: what are you saying!
speaker2: y'see -- i lied to you. i really love fame.
speaker1: why are you doing this to me?
speaker2: 'cause you're in the room.
speaker1: and this is gonna help! it's probably the cause. 'least put some soul in your success asshole!
speaker2: maybe you're the cause!
speaker1: right.
speaker2: i mean i don't have this problem with anybody else.
speaker1: give it to me!!!
speaker2: no!!!!! mommy!!!
speaker1: you man i'm outta here.
speaker2: get mad! yeahhh! love my girl! yeah, go the other guys. how many white guys have you pam? 10, 20? black guys what? you like chinese dicks? mongolian penis? 30?
speaker1: ...how many dogs have you you don't say no to anybody! drugs, dogs, uglies, you'd a doorknob with butter on it!
speaker2: how could i do that
speaker1: you're the first one who couldn't make it with me anyway! you're the only limp in the lot!!!
speaker3: wild child full of grace savior of the human race your cool face natural child, terrible child not your mother or your father's child your own child, screaming wild

speaker1: you were saying? 
speaker1: ...will you die for me, pam, a clown, a despicable clown?... a mere despicable clown?
speaker2: yes yes yes.
speaker1: ...i need a home. a place to hide.
speaker2: ...with me. yes... yes...
speaker1: ...how could we make a home?... where there's sanctuary?
speaker2: ...yes, yes, yes.
speaker1: ...we're in africa, we're just animals... i wanna stay inside you all night baby... let's death away, now death away...
speaker2: ...yes...

speaker1: what are your songs about mr. morrison? 
speaker2: uh love death travel... revolt. we all write the songs, we're interested in anything about disorder, chaos, especially activity which seems to have no meaning... i think when you make peace with authority, you become authority.
speaker1: can you define that a little more?
speaker2: yeah you can call us politicians i guess.

speaker1: ...a scapegoat maybe -- i take on the audiences' fantasies, obeying their impulses. when the impulses are destructive, i'm destructive. it's kinda like sucking the puss out of a rattlesnake, something like that. 
speaker2: ...like a medicine man or witch doctor?
speaker3: jim said to me once, the history of rock and roll's like greek drama or caveman stories. the audience comes to see ancient rituals in ancient caves. their souls in jeopardy. they're not watching any longer, they're participating -- and everything's in play, your life, your death...

speaker1: mr. morrison, how do you feel about being called the "ultimate barbie doll". 
speaker2: i guess when you say something like that, it's a shortcut to thinking.
speaker1: then do you "think" about the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has gotten?
speaker2: i guess they didn't understand.
speaker1: and it's true you financed it's publication?
speaker3: have you bothered to read the poetry ma'm? you keep denying that anything good can come from l.a., i mean isn't that kind of a provincial attitude? that bob dylan's the only poet cause he's from the east coast, but you won't even look past jim's looks at the words man!
speaker2: hey c'mon ray, hate should be allowed.
speaker4: ...but what really are your songs about mr. morrison? you preach, "saving the planet", "making a new age" but how does drinking, taking drugs, this boozy sort of apocalyptic stance at the world influence young people in a positive way?
speaker2: i like that -- "boozy apocalyptic" -- you're a word man, but how does your newspaper influence young people to think about vietnam? who's sending the soldiers over there to die? the establishment -- right? your newspaper -- right? that seems to me a lot more dangerous than the stuff we do.

speaker1: do you believe in drugs mr. morrison? 
speaker2: did you know nietzsche said, "all good consciousness, all evidence of truth comes only from the senses"? hey you wanna arm wrestle? come on, you look pretty tough today. c'mon, i'll take you all on.
speaker1: and alcohol? is that considered part of the shaman's wisdom?
speaker2: part of the clown's wisdom -- it's kinda the american way. you know we spend more on alcohol and tobacco than on education.
speaker1: are you by any chance in a trance now mr. morrison?
speaker2: do you hurt?
speaker1: what?
speaker2: what hurts you the most?
speaker1: what are you doing?

speaker1: uh... got tired of the barbie doll look. it hurt. 
speaker2: are you serious?
speaker3: what do your parents think about what you are doing?
speaker3: but they must've expressed some feeling?
speaker1: well, to be honest they're not living anymore so i don't like to talk about that.
speaker3: could you at least tell us how they died?
speaker1: oh, it was a... horrible car crash... in the desert in the fifties, arizona... ran right into a truckload of indians... navajos, they were lying out on the road, all bleeding, and i was with my grandma and grandad, we were banged up and all... and i was looking at my dad and he was lying there... but his throat was severed and there was air coming out.
speaker3: i'm sorry.
speaker4: i have the feeling i'm being put on.
speaker1: y'all believe what you want to believe, you will anyway... but it does kinda show you what excites people? fear, pity, horror -- all those good things that count. it's sorta i guess like being on the edge of an orgasm, y'know... that mystery just before you come. when? if? should i? will you die for me, eat me, this way, the end...

speaker1: you want to do some more cocaine? it'll loosen you up. 
speaker2: great! a new thing.
speaker2: wow how old is this?
speaker1: 14th century. i practice the craft.
speaker2: the craft?
speaker1: i'm a witch a white one.
speaker1: the kennealy's were celtic cheiftains and pre-christian shamans when your druid ancestors the morrisons were a minor scottish clan founded by a son of the king of norway.
speaker1: it's a religion, witchcraft. witches are the protectors of the seasons, the harvests, goddesses of the grain. and when crossed, destroyers.
speaker1: you ever try drinking blood?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: it works you know. you drink blood the right time of the moon... they used to dance in the forests naked. i think that's what offended the puritans and led to the burnings. they were a sexual threat to their male order like the bacchae -- five days a year for dionysus, they used to wander the hills in ancient greece, the first witches, clans of wild women fucking, looting, eating animals raw, the wine in their blood running hot -- looking for dionysus... to tear him to pieces -- isn't that wild?
speaker2: where do you get the blood?

speaker1: blood is the rose of mysterious union, symbol of potency... now you. 
speaker2: no... i don't like... cutting myself.
speaker3: before you slip into unconsciousness i'd like to have another kiss another flashing chance at bliss another kiss, another kiss

speaker1: i'm gonna burn you down. 
speaker2: come on...
speaker2: cut me! cut me go on!
speaker1: nobody'd ever look at you again -- 'cept me. i'd scar you forever.
speaker2: yeah yeah!

speaker1: take off your shirt. 
speaker2: mooooooo!!!
speaker1: ...the camera is like a roulette wheel jim. it becomes whoever you want it to be -- a woman you want to seduce, a man you want to kill, a mother you want to upset, a wife you want to lie to or love, whatever you want it to be, it is...
speaker2: where are the doors.
speaker1: forget the doors. it's you they want, jim. you're the doors.
speaker2: we do everything together.
speaker1: you control the audience, like dogs, manipulate them jim, one picture can control a million people, be anything you want -- growl at them, be ugly, be frightened, be selfish. be man, woman, whild, animal. live, die, return again. anything you want. everything is permitted.
speaker1: go on look at yourself, fall in love with yourself. you're your own audience now jim. they want you. worship and love and adore you...
speaker1: ...jim morrison, the of rock and cock...
speaker2: i am the snake and you are the lute
speaker1: exactly...
speaker3: people are strange when you're a stranger faces look ugly when you're alone women seem wicked when you're unwanted streets are uneven when you're down

speaker1: oh jim this is tom... baker, he's an actor, he was in andy's movie and this is count ruspoli. he lives in paris, but he's italian. he's from a very famous family over there. they're seven hundred years old.

speaker4: nico!

speaker1: well, it was such a big opening, we just had to go to philadelphia, y'know, you were supposed to, mmm... 
speaker2: andy! andy!
speaker3: ...but so many people showed up, the paintings were getting crushed, so they took them all down... um, it really looked great y'know... maybe uhhh...
speaker4: ...the walls. the blank walls. andy was the art. should do a show. just walls. today it's really about people, not what they do. it's the astronaut that matters, not the voyage, the actor, not the movie -- how do i say, it's the trip, not arriving.
speaker4: ...you know what andy says, some day everybody's gonna be famous for 15 seconds, but it won't mean anything.
speaker5: that's too short. i need a coupla hours.
speaker3: we'd just love to have you in our movies jim, you're so beautiful, you'd be so good, you mmmm, here... this is for you jim.

speaker1: "lord byron"? really. you think? you like the poems? 
speaker2: like? i loved them! "mad bad and dangerous to know." that's what they said about him. your poems should be taken as seriously.
speaker1: these are the kindest words i've ever heard in my life. no one has ever understood. thank you. maybe i should always my critics.
speaker2: y'know i don't even like rockers. they're sleazy. i made up my list the other night -- out of 30 guys there were maybe three of them, y'know. i'm not a groupie.
speaker1: let's do it, here, now... with the sound of the crowd. like nuremberg, wild german

speaker1: about what!
speaker2: your father. why do you tell me like your father's dead?
speaker1: what's your problem with fathers! they're dead, both of them, i told you.
speaker2: if he's so dead, then who answered the phone when i called the house?
speaker2: you didn't really think you'd get away with that, morrison. an admiral in the united states navy. who's at the gulf of tonkin when vietnam starts. your dad's a deputy chief of operations.
speaker1: what'd he say? that was really stupid. why didn't you just ask me.
speaker2: well naturally he wasn't too happy when i called. your mom wanted to talk but he shut her off.
speaker1: you're a you could ruin his career if...
speaker2: what, i'm a "fuckin' cunt" because i called the house? like it's hard to trace your school records. university of florida, albuquerque, new mexico, arlington, virginia, washington, d.c. brother, sister, it's seven miles long baby -- it's all in the "the end", it's so easy.
speaker2: don't ever try to hide anything from me again. okay? go on... tell me. did he make you cut your hair? did he hit you, was he a bully? did he love you? how much?

speaker2: ...and then this little man came in there, this little man in a little blue suit and a little blue cap...
speaker2: and he started pushing me and i pushed back and he didn't like that so he reached back there and got out his little can of mace. and sprayed it right in my eyes. and blinded me. why? cause i was alone in a room with a lady doing what he would like to be doing if he could ever get it up without a gun.

speaker1: i drink so i can talk to assholes. this includes me. let's just say i was testing the bounds of reality -- that's-all -- i was curious... i kinda always preferred to be hated. like erich von stroheim in the movies... the man you loved to hate... it's meant to be ironic, courage wants to laugh. y'know it's essentially a stupid situation. i go out on a stage and i howl for people. in me they see what they want to see -- some say the lizard king, whatever that means, or some black-clad leather demon whatever that means... but really i think of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being but with the soul of a clown which always forces me to blow it at the most crucial moment... a fake hero... a joke the gods played on me... it's okay, i accept the joke... and smile. death old friend, death and my cock, i can forgive my injuries in the name of wisdom, luxury, romance. words got me the wound and will get me well. all join now in lament of my cock, a tongue of knowledge in the feathered night. boys get crazy in the head and suffer. i sacrifice my on the alter of silence. the engineer looking at him puzzled. has jim lost it? mike, 
speaker2: hey jim, how 'bout hitting a strip- joint? it's getting late and we can...

speaker1: a hot night in miami january '69 -- every space in the auditorium is consumed... unfortunately the doors have long since sold out. they've become an act. morrison "falls" off the stage at least every other performance. "the soft parade" album only confirms the plasticity of their approach. songs like "touch me" and "follow me down" are not the doors we once knew. so the question is: why am i here? are funerals entertainment? densmore looks on from the stage wings, withdraws -- to ray nearby. 
speaker2: he ain't gonna show! i know it man. we should go on without him.
speaker3: bill's with him. they're an hour away, he'll get him here.

speaker1: goddamit jim! we missed one already, we gotta get this one man!

speaker2: i can't fly sober.
speaker3: jim, you don't show for this one, we're dead, the whole group -- no more bookings.
speaker1: i care.
speaker4: come on jim, we'll get laid in miami.
speaker3: we need the work jim! they're making us post a $10,000 bond just to show up -- we're the only group in rock-n- roll with a clause! get him on the plane. that's what i pay you for.
speaker2: you're an awful little guy to be talking like that.
speaker1: chump change, we're working for chump change.
speaker3: look at you, you're a pathetic slob and so are all your friends!
speaker1: i got an idea bill, you're fired.

speaker1: listen to 'em! they're not coming for the music anymore. they're coming to see a freak show! 
speaker2: you think it's easy for him. he moves left he's got vice squad, on the right narcs -- and the audience just waiting for him to get busted.
speaker1: he wanted it! not us. i just don't get the point anymore. i never did i guess. y'ask me he's just become a drunken that's what. and he's gonna take us down with him.
speaker2: compassion was never your forte man.
speaker1: don't lecture me mr. philosopher, you never felt a thing in your life. i loved that man. i loved what he was.
speaker3: it ain't the old jim that's for sure. i think he's living for everybody else man and somewhere along the way he's lost his own self.
speaker2: the wine man, the ancient wine. the ancient wine.
speaker3: what?
speaker2: something he once told us. about dionysos. when the madness took over...

speaker5: come on guys, cool it!

speaker1: c'mon paul, you can get us some heroin man. 
speaker2: no i can't and i won't.

speaker1: oh and what is my goal paul? death?
speaker2: "death old friend".
speaker1: wrong. i just want the pure beauty of absolute zero and sing the blues man -- do nuthin, go nowhere, just be.
speaker3: with that waistline jimbo you got no choice.
speaker1: what's wrong with being a large mammal, a big beast like a tank. i feel great!
speaker4: yeah. what's wrong with being fat.
speaker3: you mean "crawling king flab"? rock is babe and your rock is dyin'.

speaker1: i never knew what you saw in that nightmare chick man.
speaker2: well she is kinda flakey -- like me. i mean she's just so vulnerable about everything. it makes me sad man. but she's always kinda believed in something about me y'know -- her little picture of me as the unsung poet -- and it's a fantasy i kinda dig y'know, 'stead of the one i live.
speaker1: i don't know man, i don't wanna sound like your old man but you're only 27, you're living like you gotta get it all in, you gotta slow down man, you did it, you broke thru to the other side.
speaker2: we didn't break thru ray, we just pushed things a little. when you really break thru, there's nothing left. no music, no doors, no nothing -- only a will to power.
speaker1: i don't believe that. you were an american prince, man -- with overbred genes -- no! what could've been jim? you could've been president. no man! what could've been jim? we stood here on this beach on the edge of the pacific that crazy summer day in '65 -- and we knew, you and i, we knew we were at the edge of the mind. we were there, man. one planet, one globe, one mind. consciousness, we raised it, we were there.
speaker2: and now what?
speaker1: now? you've made me into ishmael. i am the last survivor of the pequod. and i exist only to tell the story of ahab who fought the black whale.
speaker2: it was white ray. you gotta stop harpin' on that day. i was so ripped i can hardly remember it.
speaker1: hey, what was that poem you once wrote about two chicks on the pier?
speaker2: come on man, i gotta fly.
speaker1: come on. just once.
speaker2: in that year we had a great visitation of energy back in those days everything was simpler and more confused one summer night, going to the pier i ran into two young girls the blonde was called freedom the dark one enterprise we talked and they told me this story.
speaker1: what was the story?

speaker1: well, didja get all that? 
speaker2: you done good, jim, go now -- rest

speaker1: ...was it all right jim, did you enjoy it when it came my baby? just like you said it'd be?
speaker2: they are waiting to take us into the severed garden do you know how pale and wanton thrillful comes death at a strange hour? unannounced unplanned for like a scaring overfriendly guest you've brought to bed? death makes angels of us all? and gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws...

speaker1: ladies and gentlemen, from los angeles california -- the doors! 
speaker2: ...have you seen the warm progress under the stars? have you forgotten the keys to the kingdom? have you been born yet and are you alive? where is the feast we were promised? let's reinvent the gods, the myths of the ages! we need great golden copulations camera closing past the doors to jim alone, circling the mike with his dance -- the indian ghostman jigging, shaman- like, off to the side -- now levitating above the stage, all crazy, gawky dancing.
speaker3: well, i'll tell you a story of whiskey, mystics and men and about the believers and how the whole thing began first there were women and children obeying the moon then daylight brought wisdom and sickness too soon... the moon is a dry blood beast we have assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre to propagate our for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets we live we die and death not ends it
speaker3: bird of prey, bird of prey flying high, flying high in the summer sky bird of prey, bird of prey flying high, flying high gently pass by bird of prey, bird of prey flying high, flying high take me on your flight i will come again down from the wild mountains
