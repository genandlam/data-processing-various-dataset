VOICE OVER: ...but there's a spirit of camaraderie that exists between the men, like you find only in combat maybe... 
CON: grrrr...
VOICE OVER: ...or on a pro ball club in the heat of a pennant drive.

VOICE OVER: in an effort to better ourselves we were forced to meet with a counselor who tried to help us figure out why we were the way we were... 
COUNSELOR: why do you use the word "trapped"?

CON: huh? 
COUNSELOR: why do you say you feel "trapped" in a man's body?
CON: oh...

CHAIRMAN: have you learned anything, hi? 
HI: yessir, you bet.
WOMAN: you wouldn't lie to us, would you hi?
HI: no ma'am, hope to say.
CHAIRMAN: okay then.

VOICE OVER: i tried to stand up and fly straight, but it wasn't easy with that sumbitch reagan in the white house... 
VOICE OVER: ...i dunno, they say he's a decent man, so...
VOICE OVER: ...maybe his advisers are confused.

ED: turn to the right!

CLOSE ON MOPPING CON: as hi passes.
CON: grrrr...
PRISON HALL: group is meeting again.
COUNSELOR: most men your age, hi, are getting married and raising up a family. they wouldn't accept prison as a substitute.
COUNSELOR: ...would any of you men care to comment?
GALE: but sometimes your career gotta come before family.
EVELLE: work is what's kept us happy.
ANGRY BLACK CON: yeah, but doc schwartz is sayin' you gotta accept responsibilities. i mean i'm proud to say i got a family... somewheres.

VOICE OVER: i tried to sort through what the doc had said, but prison ain't the easiest place to think. 
MOSES: an' when they was no meat we ate fowl. an' when they was no fowl we ate crawdad. an' when they was no crawdad to be foun', we ate san'.

HI: i know that, sir.
CHAIRMAN: okay then.

VOICE OVER: now i don't know how you come down on the incarceration question... 
VOICE OVER: ...whether it's for rehabilitation or revenge.

SHERIFF: don't forget his latents, ed!

HI: hear about the paddy-wagon collided with the segment mixer, ed? twelve hardened criminals escaped.

VOICE OVER: they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, and for once they may be right. 
HI: you missed a spot.
CON: grrrr...

VOICE OVER: more and more my thoughts turned to ed, and i finally felt the pain of imprisonment. 
MOSES: an' momma would frow the live crawdad in a pot of boiln' water. well one day i decided to make my own crawdad...
VOICE OVER: ...an' i frew it in a pot, forgettin' to put in the water, ya see...
VOICE OVER: ...and it was like i was makin' popcorn, ya see... the joint is a lonely place after lock-up and fights out...
VOICE OVER: ...when the last of the cons has been swept away by the sandman.
HI'S POV: the underside of the top bunk.

VOICE OVER: but i couldn't help thinking that a brighter future lay ahead - a future that was only eight to fourteen months away. 
PAROLE BOARD ROOM: hi and the same three officers.
CHAIRMAN: got a name for people like you, hi. that name is called recidivism.
SECOND MAN: ree-peat o-fender.

BUD: no, not that motherscratcher! bill parker! anyway, we're approachin' the wreck, and there's a spherical object arestin' on the highway...
BUD: ...and it don't look like a piece a the car.
VOICE OVER: mostways the job was a lot like prison, except ed was waitin' at the end of every day...

VOICE OVER: ...and a paycheck at the end of every week. 
CASHIER: gummint do take a bite, don't she?

VOICE OVER: these were the happy days, the salad days as they say... 
VOICE OVER: ...and ed felt that having a critter was the next logical step. it was all she thought about.
VOICE OVER: ...her point was that there was too much love and beauty for just the two of us...
VOICE OVER: ...and every day we kept a child out of the world was a day he might later regret having missed.
ED: that was beautiful.

HI: it's true i've had a checkered past, but ed here is an officer of the law twice decorated... 
THE AGENT: looking, with a dead pan, from the file to hi.
HI: ...so we figure it kind of evens out.
VOICE OVER: ...but biology and the prejudices of others conspired to keep us childless.

VOICE OVER: our love for each other was stronger than ever... 
VOICE OVER: ...but i preminisced no return of the salad days.

VOICE OVER: even my job seemed as dry and bitter as a hot prairie wind. 
BUD: so here comes bill a-walkin' down nine mile - that's bill parker, y'understand - got his sandwich in one hand, the head in the other...

GLEN: what'm i talkin' about?! i'm talkin' about sex, boy! what the hell're you talkin' about?! you know, "l'amour"?! i'm talkin' me'n dot are swingers! as in "to swing"! wife-swappin'! what they call nowadays open marriage!
GLEN: i'm talkin' about the revolution! i'm talkin' about-

HI: keep your hands off my wife! 
GLEN: man!
GLEN: ...i was only tryin' to help!
HI: keep your hands off my wife!
TRACKING ON GLEN: with hi pursuing in the background.
GLEN: you're crazy! i feel pity for you, man! you-

ED: we finally go out with some decent people and you break his nose. that ain't too funny, hi. 
HI: his kids seemed to think it was funny.
ED: well they're just kids, you're a grown man with responsibilities. whatever possessed you?
HI: he was provokin' me when i popped him.
ED: how'd he do that?
HI: ...never mind.
ED: but hi, he's your foreman, he's just gonna fire you now.
HI: i expect he will.
ED: and where does that leave me and nathan jr.?
HI: with a man for a husband.
ED: that ain't no answer.
HI: honey, that's the only answer.
HI: ...nathan needs some huggies. i'll be out directly.
HI: ...mind you stay strapped in.

ED: "not by the hair of my chinny-chin- chin." then i'll huff and i'll puff...' 
ED: "...and i'll blow your house in..."

ED: you 
HI: better hurry it up. i'm in dutch with the wife.

ED'S CAR: driving. she hears distant gunshots. 
ED: that son of a hold on, nathan. we're gonna go pick up daddy.

SPEAKER: that's private property, son. come back out to the street and reveal yourself to officer steensma and officer scott - that's me. 
YARD: hi vaults a fence to land in the backyard.

ED: that son of a 
ED: ...lookie nathan, a police car...
ED: ...say, that looks like bill steensma.

DRIVER: son, you got a on your head. 
HI: just drive fast...
HI: ...and don't stop till i tell ya.
HI: ...honey!
HIS POV: ed's car is braking and spinning into a u-turn.
BACK TO HI: leaning out the window.
HI: mind the baby now!

HI: maybe you better. 
CLOSE SHOT BRAKE PEDAL: stepped on hard. the brakes scream.

HI: thank you honey, you really didn't have to do this- 
ED: you you're actin' like a mad dog!
HI: turn left, honey.
ED: what if me'n the baby'd been picked up? nathan jr. would a been accessory to armed robbery!
HI: nawww honey, it ain't armed robbery if the gun ain't loaded-
ED: what kind of home life is this for a toddler?! you're supposed to be an example!
HI: now honey, i never postured myself as the three-piece suit type - turn left, dear.
ED: we got a child now, everything's changed!
HI: well nathan jr. accepts me for what i am and i think you better had, too. you know, honey, i'm okay you're okay? that - there's what it is.
ED: i know, but honey -
HI: see i come from a long line of frontiersmen and - here it is, turn here dear - frontiersmen and outdoor types.
ED: i'm not gonna live this way, hi. it just ain't family life!
HI: well... it ain't ozzie and harriet.

ED: tomorrow morning. now i got nothing against you personally... 
ED: ...but you're wanted by the authorities and you're a bad influence in this household, in my opinion.
GALE: well ma'am... we sure didn't mean to influence anyone.
EVELLE: and if we did, we apologize.
ED: i'm goin' in to town tomorrow to see about some shots for the baby. when i come back you better be gone or i'll kick you out myself. she storms into the bedroom and slams the door.
EVELLE: ...what's he need, his dip-tet?
HI: i'm awful sorry boys, but when ed gets mad, you know, when she gets an idea...
GALE: well there ain't a thing to apologize for, h.i...
GALE: ...it seems pretty clear what the situation is here.
EVELLE: yeah, i guess the missus wants us to clear out.
GALE: now h.i., you'll pardon me for sayin' so, but i get the feelin' that this- here...
GALE: ...ain't exactly workin' out.
HI: well now ed's generally a real sweetheart, i-
GALE: and as per usual, i wouldn't be surprised if the source of the marital friction was financial.
HI: well, matter of fact, i did lose my job today-
EVELLE: come on hi. you're young, you got your health - what do you want with a job?
GALE: but look, i'd rather light a candle than curse your darkness. as you know, evelle'n i never go anywhere without a reason... and here we are in your little domicile. we come to invite you in on a score.
EVELLE: a bank, hi.
HI: aw boys, i don't-
GALE: i know you're partial to convenience stores but, h.i., the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocery.
EVELLE: it's like doc schwartz says: you gotta have a little ambition. why we just heard on the news how somebody snatched off one of the arizona babies. now there's someone thinkin' big.
GALE: and here you are sittin' around on your playin' house with a - don't get me wrong, h.i., with a fine woman - but a woman who needs the button-down type.
HI: well now that ain't really any of your-
GALE: just lookahere...
EVELLE: picture of el dorado, hi.
GALE: though the locals call it the farmers and mechanics bank of lagrange. looks like a hayseed bank and, tell you the truth, it is a hayseed bank. except the last friday of every financial quarter there's more cash in that bank than flies at a barbecue.
EVELLE: and guess what day it is tomorrow?
GALE: ya see, h.i., it's when the hayseeds come in to cash their farm subsidy checks.
EVELLE: a-one information.
GALE: got it in the joint from a guy named lawrence spivey, one of nixon's undersecretaries of agriculture.
EVELLE: he's in for solicitin' from a state trooper.
GALE: ordinarily we don't associate with that class of person, but...
GALE: ...he was tryin' to make brownie points with some of the boys.
HI: boys, i can't -
EVIELLE: we need someone handy with a scatter- gun to cover the hayseeds while we get the cash.
GALE: y'understand, h.i., if this works out it's just the beginning of a spree across the entire southwest proper. we keep goin' 'till we can retire - or we get caught.
EVELLE: either way we're fixed for life.
HI: boys, it's a kind offer, but you're suggesting i just up'n leave ed. now that'd be pretty cowardly, wouldn't it.
GALE: would it? think about it, h.i. seems to me, stayin' here, y'ain't doin' her any good. and y'ain't bein' true to your own nature.

BACK TO HI: still creeping in. 
VOICE OVER: maybe it's my upbringing; maybe it's just that my genes got screwed up - i don't know...

VOICE OVER: but the events of the last day have showed, amply, that i don't have the strength of character to raise up a family... 
VOICE OVER: ...in the manner befitting a responsible adult, and not like the wild man from borneo.

VOICE OVER: ...i will love you always, truly and deeply. but i fear that if i stay i would only bring bad trouble... 
VOICE OVER: ...on the heads of you and nathan jr.

VOICE OVER: i feel the thunder gathering even now; if i leave, hopefully, it will leave with me. 
VOICE OVER: i cannot tarry...

BACK TO HI: still creeping in. 
VOICE OVER: better i should go, send you money, and let you curse my name. your loving... herbert.

THE OTHER HAND: similarly producing a long wooden match. 
DISCOLORED TEETH: biting down on the cigar.

SECRETARY'S VOICE: i'm sorry, mr. arizona, he just barged in... 
SECRETARY'S VOICE: ...should i call dewayne?
NATHAN: no, why wake the security guard. i'll take care a this.

BIKER: you got flies. 
NATHAN: i doubt it. this place's climate- controlled, all the windows are sealed. who the are you?
BIKER: name of leonard smalls. my friends call me lenny...
BIKER: ...only i ain't got no friends.
NATHAN: stop, you'll make me bust out crying. listen leonard, you want some furniture or a shitbox, they're out on the sales floor.
SMALLS: nooo, i ain't a customer, i'm a manhunter. ordinarily. though i do hunt babies, on occasion. hear you got one you can't put your hand to.
NATHAN: what do you know about it?
SMALLS: wal, that's my business. i'm a tracker- part hopi indian, some say part hound dog. when some skips bail, crashes outta the joint, i'm the man they call.
NATHAN: mister, i got the cops, the state troopers and the federal-b-i already lookin' for my boy. now if you got information i strongly advise-
SMALLS: cop won't find your boy. cop couldn't find his own if it had a bell on it. wanna find an outlaw, call an outlaw. wanna find a dunkin donuts, call a cop.
NATHAN: smalls, first off, take your feet off m'furniture. second off, it's widely known i posted a twenty grand reward for my boy. if you can find him, claim it. short of that what do we got to talk about?
SMALLS: price. fair price. and that ain't whatever you say it is; fair price is what the market'll bear. now there are people, mind you, there are people in this land, who'll pay a lot more'n twenty grand for a healthy baby.
NATHAN: what're you after?
SMALLS: give you an idea, when i was a lad i m'self fetched twenty-five thousand on the black market. and them's 1954 dollars. i'm sayin, fair price. for fifty grand i'll track him, find him-

SMALLS: ...and the people that took him... 
SMALLS: ...i'll kick their butts.
SMALLS: ...no extra charge.
NATHAN: and if i don't pay?
SMALLS: oh i'll get your boy regardless. cause if you don't pay, the market will.
NATHAN: you wanna know what i think? i think you're an evil man. i think this is nothin' but a screw job. i think it's a shakedown. i think you're the one took nathan jr. and my fine friend, i think you're the one gonna get his kicked...
NATHAN: i think i'm on the phone to the cops right now, and i-

GALE: up and attem, h.i. today is the first day of the rest of your life... 
EVELLE: ...and already you're it up. hi looks up.
EVELLE: come on, the missus'll be back from town soon.
HI: where's the baby?
EVELLE: bedroom, in his crib.
GALE: he's sawin' toothpicks, he'll be fine.
GALE: ...you expectin' anybody?
HI: no. you two stay outta sight.
HI: 

HI: morning glen. 
GLEN: i ain't comin' in if ya don't mind. i'll just keep my distance.
HI: i didn't invite you in, glen.
GLEN: well don't even bother. first off, you're fired - and that's official.
HI: i kinda figured that, glen.
GLEN: well that ain't why i'm here neither. no sir. you're in a whole shitload of trouble, my friend.
HI: why don't you just calm down, glen.
GLEN: why don't you make me?! know that little baby you got in there? remember him? i know what his real name is!
HI: wanna keep your voice down, glen?
GLEN: i'll pitch my voice wherever i please! his name ain't hi jr.! his name ain't ed jr.! but it's junior an right! yes sir, it's nathan jr.! hi takes one step down holding out a calming hand.
GLEN: ...stay away from me, mcdunnough!
GLEN: ...sure, you're an awful big man when you got somethin' around to clobber a guy with!
HI: i ain't a big man.
GLEN: that's right! and now you're at my mercy!
GLEN: ...i'm your worst nightmare! i wanted to just turn you in for the re-ward. but dot, she wants something to cuddle. so it looks like that baby's gonna be glen jr. from now on!
GLEN: ...i'll give you a day to break the news to ed...
GLEN: ...dot'll be by tomorrow to pick him up.
GLEN: ...it's either that or jail. oh and say, that reminds me! you'll find a doctor bill in the mail in a few days. i recommend you pay it! and the car squeals off.

HI: what's goin' on here. 
GALE: you know what's goin' on, h.i. it's

HI: i know you're worried honey but believe me, there ain't a thing to worry about. we're gonna get him back, there just ain't no question about that... 
HI: ...we'll get him back, that's just all there is to it. and you wanna know another thing?
HI: ...i'm gonna be a better person from here on out. and that's final, i mean that's absolutely the way it's gonna be, that's official. you were right and i was wrong...
HI: ...a blind man could tell you that. now they ain't gonna hurt him, they're just in it for the score...
HI: ...but i ain't like that no more, i'm a changed man. you were right and i was wrong. we got a family here and i'm gonna start acting responsibly...
HI: ...so let's go honey...
HI: ...let's go get nathan jr.

GALE: i luuuuv to drive. 
EVELLE: you said somethin' there, partner.
GALE: ...yessir, i figure with the ransom and this bank, you'n i'll be sittin' in the fabled catbird seat.
EVELLE: uh, gale... junior had a, uh, accident.
GALE: what's that, pardner?
EVELLE: he had a little accident.
GALE: wuddya mean, he looks okay.
EVELLE: no, ya see... movin' though we are, he just had hisself a rest stop.
GALE: well it's perfectly natural.
EVELLE: hey gale!
GALE: what now?
EVELLE: ...he smiled at me!

CASHIER: welp. around the butt, then up over the groin area- 
EVELLE: i know where they go, old timer. i mean do i need pins or fasteners?
CASHIER: well no, they got those tape-ettes already on there, it's self-contained and fairly explanatory.
EVELLE: uh-huh...
EVELLE: ...these blow up into funny shapes at all?
CASHIER: well no. unless round is funny.
EVELLE: all right, i'll take these too. now you lie down back there-
CASHIER: yessir!
EVELLE: and don't you move till you've counted up to eight hundred and twenty-five and then backwards down to zero. i'll be back to check - see y'ain't cheatin'.
CASHIER: you the diaper burglar?
EVELLE: looks like i'm one of 'em.

EVELLE: get the door, will ya? 
GALE: he's a real cheerful little critter once he warms up to ya.
EVELLE: hurry up gale...
EVELLE: i don't know how high this one can count.

EVELLE: i got him some baby grub... baby wipes... diapers, disposable... packet of balloons- 
GALE: they blow up into funny shapes at all?
EVELLE: no, just- gale is looking around, puzzled.
GALE: say, where's junior?
EVELLE: wuddya mean, didn't you put him in?!
GALE: no, i thought- the two men look at each other.

BACK TO FRONT ANGLE: they look at each other in horror. 
GALE: where'd we leave him?!
CLOSE ON GALE'S FOOT: coming off the accelerator.
CLOSE ON EVELLE: screaming as he watches the foot:

CASHIER: ...seven hunnert ninety-one one thousand, seven hunnert - ah... 
CASHIER: seven hunnert ninety - ought one thousand! seven hundred eighty -

EVELLE: promise we ain't never gonna give him up, gale! we ain't never gonna let him go! 
GALE: we'll never give him up, evelle. he's our little gale jr. now.

HI: ...ed, i realize i can't be much of a comfort to you. but lemme just say this... 
HI: you'll feel a whole lot better when-
ED: i don't wanna feel better.
HI: honey-
ED: i don't care about myself anymore. i don't care about us anymore. i just want nathan junior back safe.
HI: i know that-
ED: if we don't get him back safe, i don't wanna go on livin'. and even if we do, i don't wanna go on livin' with you. this shuts hi up.
ED: ...i guess i still love you hi; i know i do. i ain't even blaming you. the whole thing was crazy and the whole thing was my idea.
HI: well, factually, i myself bear a very large-
ED: lemme finish. since those jailbirds took little nathan i been doin' some thinking, and i ain't too proud of myself. even if mrs. arizona had more'n she could handle, i was a police officer sworn to uphold the constitution of the united states -
HI: now waitaminute honey, you resigned before we-
ED: that ain't the point, hi. we don't deserve nathan jr. any more'n those jailbirds do. and if i'm as selfish and irresponsible as you-
HI: y'ain't that bad, honey.
ED: if i'm as bad as you, what good're we to each other. you'n me's just a fool's paradise.
FARMERS AND MECHANICS BANK: baking in the noonday sun.

EVELLE: there she is. 
GALE: yep. welp...
GALE: ...let's do her.
EVELLE: waitaminute. what do we do with gale jr.?
GALE: wuddya mean, he waits here.
EVELLE: are you crazy?! he can't wait here by hisself. supposin' we get killed in there - it could be hours before he's discovered.

GALE: all right you hayseeds, it's a stick- up! everbody freeze! everbody down on the ground! 
HAYSEED: well which is it young fella? you want i should freeze or get down on the ground? mean to say, iffen i freeze, i can't rightly drop. and iffen i drop, i'm a gonna be in motion. ya see -

HAYSEED: yessir. 
GALE: everone down on the ground!
EVELLE: y'all can just forget that part about freezin'.
GALE: that is until they get down there.
EVELLE: y'all hear that?
GALE: wanna fill that sack, pardner? we got -
GALE: ...where'd all the tellers go? there is no one behind the counter.
VOICE: we're down here, sir.
EVELLE: they're down on the ground like you commanded, gale.
GALE: i told you not to use m'damn name! can't you even try to keep from forget'n that?!
EVELLE: not even yer code name?
GALE: oh yeah... m'code name.
EVELLE: y'all hear that?
GALE: all right now everone, we're just about ready to begin the robbery proper...

EVELLE: all right now everyone, you know how this works: y'all stay flattened for ten full minutes... 
EVELLE: ...we might come back in five to check. that's for us to know and y'a to find out.
GALE: anyone found bipedal in five wears his for a hat.

GALE: that old timer threw off my concentration. otherwise it would a gone smoother. 
EVELLE: we done okay. yessir. this ought to split nicely three ways.
GALE: goddamnit! ya never leave a man behind!

GALE: goddamnit h.i., ain't we got enough to contend with? 
ED: where's the baby?
EVELLE: i think we left him on the roof of the... he must be back at the...
GALE: let us come with you!
GALE: ...he's our baby too!

OVER HI AND ED'S SHOULDERS: lenny is approaching. under her breath: 
ED: what is he?
HI: ...d'you see him too?

OVER LENNY'S SHOULDER: as ed closes in. 
ED: gimme that baby, you warthog from hell!

FROM BEHIND LENNY: raising an arm to stab. 
LENNYS HAND: drilled by hi's bullet, drops its knife.
LENNY: quick as a flash hurling the other knife at hi.
HI: as the knife stings the gun out of his hand.

LENNY'S POV: roaring down the alley. 
TRACKING IN FRONT OF ED: as the bike approaches behind her.

LENNY: grabbing hi by the shirtfront. 
LENNY'S OTHER HAND: swings down and brass knuckles appear on it.

HI: reacting. 
LENNY: reacting to hi reacting. he looks down.

HI: starting to run. 
LENNY: finally freeing his hands.
HI: diving behind the parked car.

NATHAN: the is goin' on? 
NATHAN: ...get away from there.
NATHAN: waitaminute...
NATHAN: ...i ain't through with you. what're you doin' creepin' around here in the dark? you in with smalls?
HI: ...scuse me?
NATHAN: leonard smalls, big fella rides a harley, dresses like a rock star?
HI: no sir, that's who we saved him from. it's a long story.
NATHAN: suppose you tell it.
HI: well, sir, in a re-ward situation, they usually say no questions asked.
NATHAN: do they. hi shrugs.
NATHAN: ...all right, boy, i guess you got a re-ward coming. twenty thousand dollars...
NATHAN: ...or, if you need home furnishings, i can give you a fine of credit at any of my stores. fact, that's the way i'd rather handle it, for tax reasons...
HI: well- nathan throws his hands up in the air.
NATHAN: but it's up to you.
HI: tell you the truth, i think we'd prefer the ca-
ED: we don't want no reward.
ED: ...we didn't bring him back for money.
NATHAN: well, we could work it that way too.
ED: could i just look at him a little bit more?
NATHAN: be my guest, young lady... but would you mind tellin' me exactly how you-
NATHAN: ...you took him, didn't you? wasn't that biker a'tal.
HI: i took him, sir, my wife had nothin' to do with it. i crept in yon window and-
ED: we both did it. we didn't wanna hurt him any; i just wanted to be a mama.
HI: it wasn't for money or nothin'. we just figured you had more'n you could handle, babywise. but i'm the one committed the actual crime sir, if you need to call the authorities-
NATHAN: shutup boy, no one's callin' the authorities if there's no harm done.
HI: thank you sir.
ED: thank you sir.
NATHAN: aw just tell me - just tell me why you did it.
ED: we can't have our own.
NATHAN: ...well lookit. if you can't have kids you gotta just keep tryin' and hope medical science catches up with you. like florence'n me - it caught up with a vengeance. and hell, even if it never does, you still got each other.
HI: sir, those're kind words. but i think the wife and me are splittin' up...
HI: ...her point of view is we're both kinda selfish and unrealistic, so we ain't too good for each other.
NATHAN: well ma'am, i don't know much but i do know human bein's. you brought back my boy so you must have your good points too. i'd sure hate to think of florence leavin' me - i do love her so...
NATHAN: ...you can go out the way you came in...
NATHAN: ...and before you go off and do another foolish thing, like busting up, i suggest you sleep on it...
NATHAN: ...at least one night.

VOICE OVER: ...i dreamt i was as light as the ether, a floating spirit visiting things to come... 
BACK TO HIGH SHOT BEDROOM: craning down toward hi.
VOICE OVER: the shades and shadows of the people in my life wrastled their way into my slumber.

VOICE OVER: i dreamt that gale and evelle had decided to return to prison... 
VOICE OVER: ...probably that's just as well. i don't mean to sound superior, and they're a swell couple guys, but...
VOICE OVER: ...maybe they weren't ready yet to come out into the world.
VOICE OVER: and then i dreamed on, into the future, to a christmas morn in the arizona home...

VOICE OVER: i saw glen, a few years later, still havin' no luck gettin' the cops to listen to his wild tales about me'n ed... 
VOICE OVER: ...maybe he threw in one pollack joke too many...
VOICE OVER: ...i don't know.

VOICE OVER: and still i dreamed on... 
VOICE OVER: ...further into the future than i'd ever dreamed before.

VOICE OVER: ...watching nathan jr.'s progress from afar... 
VOICE OVER: ...taking pride in his accomplishments as if he were our own...
VOICE OVER: ...wondering if he ever thought of us.
VOICE OVER: ...and hoping that maybe we'd broadened his horizons a little, even if he couldn't remember just how they'd got broadened.

VOICE OVER: ...and this was cloudier 'cause it was years, years away. 
VOICE OVER: ...but i saw an old couple bein' visited by their children - and all their grandchildren too. and the old couple wasn't screwed up, and neither were their kids or their grandkids. and i don't know, you tell me. this whole dream, was it wishful thinking? was i just fleein' reality, like i know i'm liable to do?

VOICE OVER: ...but me'n ed, we can be good too... 
VOICE OVER: ...and it seemed real. it seemed like us. and it seemed like well... our home... if not arizona, then a land, not too far away, where all parents are strong and wise and capable, and all children are happy and beloved... i dunno, maybe it was utah.
