AGNIS: so she wasn't just a in high heels?
AGNIS: don't stress. she mighta heard worse from her momma. i'm only guessin'.
QUOYLE: some people probably thought petal was bad clear through.
AGNIS: people. are a cynical lot.
QUOYLE: i think she just couldn't get enough love.
AGNIS: i think the evidence. is on your side.
AGNIS: the eyes study him. dissect him, even.
AGNIS: i'm headed north, nephew, to where our family comes from, in newfoundland. thought i'd never go back. but the older y'get...

QUOYLE: someone always does.

CARD: as you can see, sometimes y'can't get away. i'm tert x. card, the so-called managing editor, copyeditor, rewrite man, mechanicals, ad makeup department, mail and distribution chief, and snow shoveler. 
CARD: and you are either a big advertiser come to buy a four-page spread to push your warehouse of left-footed japanese boots. or. you. are the breathlessly-awaited quoyle.
QUOYLE: that'd be me. the second one.
CARD: have to do without the ultimate cheese, y'will. himself, mr. jack buggit, is up at the house having charms said over his scrawny chest to clear out that impressive accumulation of phlegm he's been hawking all week.

CARD: billy does the home news page. poems, baby photos, household tips, and a gossip column, under the byline of junior sugg, that is pretty much straight libel. 
CARD: in short. he writes the only stuff anybody actually reads.
CARD: now this miserable ugly brit, is b. beaufield nutbeem. imagines he's the foreign news chief. steals every story off that foul shortwave radio and rewrites it in limey prose. nutbeem which card rewrites in a mystical tongue most charitably referenced as an unacquireable taste.
NUTBEEM: mine: 'burmese sawmill owners and the rangoon development corporation met in tokyo tuesday to consider a joint approach to marketing tropical hardwoods.' got it? turns the page.
NUTBEEM: card's rewrite: 'burnoosed sawbill awnings and the ranger devotional competition met wednesday near tokyo to mark up local hairwood.' a stunned. silence.

CARD: it's shorter, and i got tokyo right. 
NUTBEEM: if misspelled.
CARD: now what's funnier, quoyle? my writing style, or the fantasy that any newfie would read that moosepuckey in the first pia... quoyle how'd the meeting go? did they agree on a joint marketing approach? the beginning. of a beautiful friendship. nutbeem still in progress, old bean. one can only hope.
CARD: there's your miserable desk, quoyle. we've got no idea what yer s'posed to do. but mr. jack buggit will drop by someday and enlighten us all. til then...

QUOYLE: this is great stuff. 'a snowmobile mishap has taken the life of 78-year- old rick puff, who was on his way home from what the widow puff calls a 'screech-in and a carouse,' when his machine fell through the ice. a well- known accordion player, mr. puff had served four years in the 1970s for sexual assault on his daughters. bet they aren't crying, either.' this billy pretty can really write! agnis ...passes as colorful. 
AGNIS: nephew, we can't fix up the house proper on a journalist's wages. so i have un-retired.
QUOYLE: from what?
AGNIS: upholstery. been sought after for 33 years, wherever i've lived. this should be the real test, huh?
AGNIS: this is dennis buggit, master carpenter.
DENNIS: only til i get my lobster license. i'm a fisherman in my soul.
DENNIS: it's a newfie thing, the compulsion to fish. y'hear yesterday's tragedy
DENNIS: 'bout the newfie who went ice fishin'?
DENNIS: brought home 200 pounds of ice. his wife fried it. they both drowned.
AGNIS: with me workin', we'll need day care for bunny after school. turns out dennis and his wife send their little girl to this wonderful saintly woman. how's that for us livin' a charmed life?
DENNIS: agnis says yer buyin' a boat. sooner's prob'ly better'n lat... quoyle i'm not buyin'. no boat.
AGNIS: well, course we're buy... quoyle
BUNNY: warren threw up in your sleeping bag.

QUOYLE: headline. dog fart fells freelance reporter. promising career nipped in bud. 
BUNNY: it's called cancer.

QUOYLE: based on my i.q. test, huh. where'd i rate? jack advanced squirrel. this ties you with me, an' i own the place. 
JACK: pleased t'meetcha, billy says yer workin' out.
JACK: tert card says he's keepin' an eye on ya. since he's a self-servin' liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it means he's jealous. and nutbeem... lifts the bullhorn...

JACK: nutbeem's obsessed with actual news. makes up for it by manning the sexual abuse desk. can't keep up with the volume there, we're runnin' three, four a week. leans forward. like he's dishing the lowdown. 
JACK: card's in charge. ya hear this and that 'bout his typos, but typos is part of gammy bird. everyone gets a laugh, and gets to figger 'em out.
JACK: better'n a crossword.
JACK: an' billy. well, billy's a writer and a fisherman. me, i'm just a fisherman.
JACK: fishin' and the sea is all i am.
QUOYLE: so he said. waitin' for his license.
JACK: naw, my boy's passed. went to sea and there he rests. bless his bones.
JACK: want two things from ya, quoyle. first. you cover every local car wreck, take pictures. front-page photo every week, whether we have a wreck or not, an' we always do. when we don't, we dip into card's file, he's got some beauties.
JACK: knack to this. if there's a dark patch on the ground, it reads blood, whether it's motor oil or diet coke. gloves, hat, lyin' in the road...
JACK: ...somethin' that humanizes, makes ya feel. that's what a wreck is. it's always saying, 'there but for the grace of god...' do ya follow? quoyle follows.

JACK: plus. we're starting a feature on the shipping news. what ships come in, what goes out. whatever's of interest. throwin' it to you, son. chance to shine. 
QUOYLE: mr. buggit. i'm not. well, a water person.
JACK: chance. to shine.
JACK: one peculiarity. i'm no joke, son, and i don't tolerate jokes about newfies. or them that does.

DENNIS: so this newfie comes to toronto. cabbie says, take ya to meet girls for a good time. boy says, okay, but i only want a newfie girl. 
DENNIS: right section of the party district, he finds a girl, they have sex, she says that's a hunnerd dollars. he says fine, tips her another hunnerd! she says, wow, can y'come back t'morrow?
DENNIS: next two nights, same thing!
DENNIS: finally she says, i never met so sweet a guy, where ya from? he says, misky bay, newfoundland. she says, really? me, too!
DENNIS: he says, i know. yer ma asked me t'give ya six hunnerd dollars!
DENNIS: yer the model newfie, q, but fer th'boat. why doncha buy nutbeem's?
NUTBEEM: i built a chinese junk. sailed it up from brazil. missed manhattan by a mile or so, got stranded here when i shipwrecked by gaze island.
NUTBEEM: almost finished my repairs. be leaving soon. as paleontologists define the term.
NUTBEEM: she's ugly. and the only thing i've ever loved.
DENNIS: yer story tugs at me bladder.
QUOYLE: him and jack. tell it.
NUTBEEM: jack buggit's psychic, start with that. he's got the gift. specially about the sea.

NUTBEEM: older brother jesson, everyone's favorite, even dennis'. goes to sea like his dad. one day, rest of the family's sitting by the radio, and jack goes white... 
NUTBEEM: stands up. says, jesson's gone. walks out of the house. grief too big for walls to hold it.
NUTBEEM: so dennis is forbidden the sea. but being free, newfie, and 21, he goes anyway.
QUOYLE: and that's enough t...?
NUTBEEM: death storm. monster wave cracks her steel hull amidships, one inch crack from starboard to port. men go in the water. dennis lost. after a week...
NUTBEEM: they come to jack, call off the search. he stands like a stone. then turns, sharp, the way he does. says only, 'he's alive. and i know where.'
QUOYLE: man's a witch.
NUTBEEM: went to sea, alone, in just a skiff. finds him. can you guess the odds? finds him. finds him. both arms broke, 99% dead.
NUTBEEM: boy comes to. jack says if you ever
NUTBEEM: step in a boat again, i'll drown ya m'self. and you know what the kid said...?
QUOYLE: say it fast.
NUTBEEM: says fishin' licenses are all spoken for, i'd appreciate you givin' me yours. jack looked in his eyes.
DENNIS: what's bein' blabbed here? nutbeem quoyle says you got a nice ass.
DENNIS: quoyle's right.
DENNIS: to my ass.
QUOYLE: i'll drink to that.

BUNNY: what's wrong with him? 
QUOYLE: hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong with you? there's nothing wr... woman sure, there is. this is herry, and he has down's syndrome. it means he learns things very slowly.
WOMAN: maybe.
QUOYLE: which one of those women is in charge here?
WOMAN: neither of 'em. they're just moms.
QUOYLE: well, my lord, whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention.
WOMAN: you think.

QUOYLE: i mean, children need structure. no one's even guarding that craft table, they could be running around with scissors and get hurt. 
QUOYLE: um. i write for the newspa...
WOMAN: well. i'd better get to work, i see. providing structure and all.
WAVEY: i'm wavey prowse, and this is my place. pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have fun.
WAVEY: oh, yeh. running with sharp objects? we save for tuesdays.

BILLY: well, she don't wear a ring, cause she lost her husband at sea. just after the boy was born.

QUOYLE: oh, yessir. he was in all the papers. way back.
MELVILLE: finest botterjacht ever built in holland. flat-bottomed, she can go right up on shore in a storm. incredibly heavy, forty tons of oak. not unlike the barges of henry viii and elizabeth i. billy we heard a them, too.
SILVER: tell them what happened. in
SILVER: hurricane bob.
MELVILLE: pounded twelve beach houses.

SILVER: now tell them. who let our insurance lapse. 
SILVER: took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it. an inch from bankruptcy.

SILVER: my dining salon needs refitting. and the best custom yacht upholsterer in the northern hemisphere just moved here. i was forced. to follow.

AGNIS: warren died today. that's what that means.
QUOYLE: poor old girl.
AGNIS: i used to live with someone named warren. died of cancer, after nine years together. dearest soul on this earth.
AGNIS: went from the funeral, and bought that dog. named her warren. just so i could say the name a hunnerd times a day. women are foolish, huh?
QUOYLE: i never thought so.
AGNIS: bunny wants to bury the dog with me. but i told her i'd rather do it alone.
AGNIS: some advice about the child?
AGNIS: don't get down on her level, the way you do. she'll never respect you.

BUNNY: that's the difference. 
QUOYLE: another necklace, huh? can i help?
BUNNY: you can watch.
QUOYLE: do i have to take my clothes off?
BUNNY: you look better with 'em on.
QUOYLE: you know. you do look good in blue.

WAVEY: you said. you'd read me your article.
QUOYLE: nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker. that's the header.
QUOYLE: quoyle
QUOYLE: well. whatcha think?
WAVEY: i think when card sees it, he'll split a gut. i think he'll sit up nights thinking of cheap shots to pay you back. i think he'll never stop until you're fired. quoyle keeps nodding at each point. yep. yep.
WAVEY: i think i haven't been so proud. of a friend. since i don't know when.

QUOYLE: i know the word, card. it means you two deserve each other.

CARD: so. this is what jack and i think. 
CARD: we wanna run quoyle's oil spill piece b'cause controversy sells papers and papers sells ads.

NUTBEEM: sounds reasonable to me. 
CARD: and we're gonna let quoyle have his head on these columns, up to 500 words. so he'll get his confidence up.
NUTBEEM: well, let's not go overboard. he's rather green doncha thi...

CARD: one more thing... hear the slamm! quoyle jack's gone fishing?

QUOYLE: headline. reporter becomes magnet for dead men. 
QUOYLE: what was my panic? he was already dead. maybe i thought, in some dim way...
QUOYLE: ...if it wasn't too late for him. it wouldn't be for petal.
QUOYLE: once i was past the shelter of the lee shore, and into the real wind. i realized my mistake.
QUOYLE: headline. reporter becomes anchor man.

QUOYLE: stupid. stupid to drown with bunny so young. no life jacket, no floating oar. no sense. 
PETAL: look, it floats. just like you.
PETAL: maybe it's filled with fat.
QUOYLE: and i wondered. am i going where she's gone?
QUOYLE: ...and will i see her?
JACK: cockadoodle christ! i knowed somebody was out here.

JACK: thank fer yer figure, me old son. a thin man woulda froze. 
JACK: good. yer lost th'boat.

WAVEY: actually. it's just my bed. 
WAVEY: actually, it's not. i just wanted to see your eyes bug out like that.
QUOYLE: you don't smoke.
WAVEY: only when i'm worried. i don't worry much.
QUOYLE: you don't have to, i'm all right.
WAVEY: i'm not worried. about you.

WAVEY: mrs. buggit called, knew bunny was still with me. the kids are camped out in the parlor. 
QUOYLE: nice. you sittin' up with me.
WAVEY: s'okay. someday you'll do somethin' nice for me.
QUOYLE: who you worried ab...
WAVEY: you didn't find a second dead man. just the rest of the first one.
QUOYLE: i asked. who you worried about?
WAVEY: you said bunny talks to petal at night. you ever listen?
QUOYLE: not really. wouldn't be right.
WAVEY: well, i'm not that nice a person.
WAVEY: she plays petal. talks to the barbies, like petal talking to her.
WAVEY: brings her cigarette. to the flame.
WAVEY: she says she's sorry she left them. it was just to see if they could be good girls. and they were...
WAVEY: ...and she loves them.
WAVEY: the barbies look better naked, bunny looks good in blue, guess who said that?
WAVEY: so we talked. just before petal left her with that...stranger? bunny had snapped her mom's bead necklace. that's why she's making more.
WAVEY: when she's made enough. she'll be forgiven.
WAVEY: she saves petal a room at the house, but she's also got the key to the old place. in case her mom would rather go there.
QUOYLE: and she talked about it. just like that.
WAVEY: sure, i lied. i said nice things about her mother.
WAVEY: see, there's only one problem.
WAVEY: quoyle thinking. madly. what can he do?
QUOYLE: so we're patient. and we wait, and we're good to her. and. maybe. time.

QUOYLE: well, hurry up. thirty, forty years i'll be rarin' to get back out on the water. 
ALVIN: gotta build her solid. who knows, mebbe jack buggit'll give his fishin' license to his boy. so next time, won't be nobody to pull yer out. dennis jack buggit's boy is drowned.
ALVIN: alvin dennis. y'hear the one about the newfie who lived ferever?
DENNIS: no sir.
ALVIN: his kid never got a fishin' license.
ALVIN: what we wait fer? she's like the main stem. gives us our shape, doncha see.
ALVIN: death's one shape. fergiveness is another.
DENNIS: thing 'bout waitin' on fergiveness? mixes up who's waitin' on who.
DENNIS: death is simpler. an' a lot shorter wait.
MRS. YARK: mr. quoyle...?
MRS. YARK: the school is callin'? it's about yer daughter?

PRINCIPAL: ...not only pushed mrs. lumball. not 
PRINCIPAL: only pushed her very hard...
PRINCIPAL: she knocked. her down.
PRINCIPAL: and. refuses to explain her act. or. apologize.
PRINCIPAL: under the circumstances. we have no choice but to suspend.
QUOYLE: uh. wavey? if it's all the same to you...

BUNNY: when you gonna ask? quoyle when you're in the mood. 
QUOYLE: she musta done something. really bad.
QUOYLE: plane.
BUNNY: she's the worst one of all!
BUNNY: herry told her he had to pee. but the way he talks. he could just say 'eeee,' like that.
BUNNY: she told him that recess was almost over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip special, an' he could hold it.
BUNNY: she made him stand against the wall.
QUOYLE: see, a good dad would say hitting is always wrong. you coulda hurt her bad. i guess you know that.
BUNNY: she wasn't hurt for real. just screamed like a baby.

QUOYLE: wish i'd seen it. it really sounds funny. 
BUNNY: petal'll think so, too.
QUOYLE: well, there won't be any trouble at school. i'ii take care of that.
BUNNY: how?
QUOYLE: because the best thing about people. is they can forgive each other. i heard that this morning.
BUNNY: that teacher. is gonna forgive me?
QUOYLE: that. and she won't want the story printed in the paper.
BUNNY: well. i don't wanna forgive her.
QUOYLE: me neither.
BUNNY: i had to do it. 'cept for wavey, i'm the only family herry's got.
BUNNY: like the ghost. who's not a ghost.
BUNNY: the one who ties the knots? you're
BUNNY: the only family he's got.
BUNNY: you said.

QUOYLE: uncle. my daughter bunny and i. we got you some hot bread. and some meat. some dried fish. some squash and vegetables...a cake...some warm clothes... 
NOLAN: ain't yer house, it's th' ouoyle house!

NOLAN: old ones. got run outta omaloor bay a hunnerd years ago. dragged that house across th' ice. on spruce runners.
NOLAN: hadda lash it to th' rock. she'll tell yer.
NOLAN: course she never come t'see me. that's obvious why.
NOLAN: your aunt agnis hamm, me son. that's cause she can't face me. i knows she killed 'im.
QUOYLE: him.
NOLAN: that baby she was carryin'. what was she t'do? she wuz only 12. an' it was her own brother what done 'er. quoyle's wide-eyed shock. quoyle her own...
NOLAN: her brother, me son. she only had th' one.

AGNIS: what? my hem crooked? as if i was wearin' a hem. 
QUOYLE: naw, i just come from seein' your cousin nolan. guess i was thinkin' about him.
DAWN: mr. quoyle? what do you think of my dress?
DAWN: i wore it just for you.
QUOYLE: that was more consideration. than i deserve.
DAWN: did your aunt tell you about all
DAWN: the money?
DAWN: agnis told us it came from macau. agnis hush yoursel...
DAWN: ...from silver melville. and it was more than she expected. and we shipped the chairs off to her. y' know, the three remaining? a really frozen beat. quoyle uh. why would she send you more tha... agnis do you have enough attention now, young lady?
DAWN: yes, ma'am, i think so. mavis echoes agnis' glare. quoyle macau, huh? so. that where y'sent th' chairs?
AGNIS: it's flatterin' you showin' me how you've turned into such a competent reporter and all. but even if i remembered where i sent 'em. i couldn't tell ya.
AGNIS: professional ethics.

WAVEY: only you. could do this. 
WAVEY: and she's not pleased.
WAVEY: you fed him. you gave him clothes. you're the first human ever was kind to him...
WAVEY: accordingly. you're sick with guilt.
WAVEY: you sure you're not a complex guy?
QUOYLE: so if y'called around. musta found somepla... wavey one decent golden age home. it's in st. john's. you can maybe afford it, tho knows why you should.
QUOYLE: i can't put him there, til i go down to st. john's. see it's all right.
WAVEY: great! let's not be rash!
QUOYLE: come with me.
QUOYLE: i mean, the kids could stay with
QUOYLE: dennis and beety. or agnis, or...
WAVEY: why. would i. do that?
QUOYLE: well. remember when you said. someday, i'd do something nice for you? and when he looks to her, she is... petal and this is it.
QUOYLE: hey. overnight trip to st. john's. all expenses paid. petal arches a delicate brow. petal overnight?
WAVEY: what's wrong with a weekend?

QUOYLE: now, listen to this for t'morrow. after i sign the papers at the home... she's already grinning. feels so comfortable. quoyle the answer to your annual outing! rainbow trout fishing in four ponds. you pay for what you catch. prizes in the ponds. if it drizzles or gets chilly, heated and lighted building available, right next to the ponds, with soft drinks, candy bars, ice cream and chips! 
WAVEY: or we could sleep in.

WAVEY: i just feel so guilty about all your expenses. two separate rooms. 
QUOYLE: hey, it's my treat. you agreed.
WAVEY: still. seems like we could figure out. something.
QUOYLE: a friend told me once. love is the only thing that counts. he nods. almost to himself. quoyle it's the engine of life.
QUOYLE: so when you told me how you think about your husband. i really understood, becau...
WAVEY: that's what i wanted us to talk abou...
QUOYLE: ...because real love. just comes once.
QUOYLE: see, you know some of the stories about petal. some of the bad things. what you don't know...

WAVEY: even tho. she never loved you. 
QUOYLE: sorta. because of it.
QUOYLE: see, love. isn't about what's good for you. isn't about what you wish it was. isn't about what...would make you happy.
QUOYLE: love. is about want. what you really want. and you can't change that. even if it's poison.
QUOYLE: so that's why it's great. to have a real friend. when you're. lonely.
WAVEY: i know you have to stay tomorrow. to sign the papers. but.
WAVEY: i should be heading back. before herry. misses me. too much.
WAVEY: and i'm not feeling so well. what i get for mixing vodka and beer, huh.
WAVEY: so i'll grab a taxi. you stay and finish. listen to the music. is
WAVEY: that all right?
QUOYLE: i cou...
WAVEY: and don't worry. i'm still your friend.
QUOYLE: she did stay my friend. in her way. even tho, for awhile, we didn't see each other a lot.
QUOYLE: funny. how one little talk. can change everything.

QUOYLE: tell me about it. just get the aunt's house fixed perfect, and i gotta move. 
QUOYLE: three hours to drive from the point, with all the ice. alvin won't have my boat ready til new years. agnis can stay over her shop. bunny and i have to find a room in town.
DENNIS: stay with us. my kid follows yours around, they'll bunk t'gether. and we gotta fluffy couch that's more'n you deserve.

NUTBEEM: it's two years. my boat's ready. if i stay any longer, i'll begin to like it here. 
QUOYLE: last friend left me. turned into a truck driver.
NUTBEEM: well. with that warning.

QUOYLE: what's the barrel for? 
QUOYLE: in orange, fills the shower stall.
NUTBEEM: i'm british. i bathe.
QUOYLE: perfect for th' chips.
NUTBEEM: it's coated with two kinds of scum.
QUOYLE: works. we forgot to buy dip.

QUOYLE: feeling that and more. what's the situation? 
NUTBEEM: one. you're moving in with dennis, no matter how fond you are of his wife.
BILLY: i'm some disgusted. with the human race.
NUTBEEM: i'da never made it, anyway. storms would have blown me to bits. you boys saved my life. yes, you did.

JACK: hands might as well be movin' while we chat. always hated th' sight a grown men around a table workin' nuthin' but their jaws. 
QUOYLE: editorial meetin', y'say. 'bout what?
JACK: well, tert card's gone, fer one thing.
JACK: yar, i know, he never said g'bye. well, don't get all weepy-eyed about it, old son. try t'be a man.
JACK: they called him from st. john's, he tells me. wants him to help put out th' newsletter fer them oil rig suppliers.
JACK: yup. believe it.
JACK: he was sassy an' he was smug. oh, there's a waitin' list, he assures me. they only skims th' cream.
QUOYLE: well, don't get all weepy-eyed abou...
JACK: truth t'tell. i was a wee help. b'hind the scenes, doncha know. keeps working. jack sometimes. enough is enough.
QUOYLE: well, billy'll do a helluva job... jack ...right where he is. too old a fish t'swim faster'n be wants. gotta find someone a little dumber t'take on a job like this!
JACK: spot i'm in, christmas and all. might have to offer th'mess. to you.
QUOYLE: course. i'd need a raise.
JACK: y'know. yer do have the sense gave a doughnut. quoyle i'ii try to live up to that.
JACK: any other outrageous demands? seein' as yer got me over a barrel. here's your one chance.
JACK: and before he can stop his mouth...
QUOYLE: well, your son...
JACK: you were sayin'...?
QUOYLE: his whole life would be changed. if he could come upon. a fishing license.
JACK: well, there's only one a those issued per family. so how exactly would he do that? this is not. going well. a dangerous silence.
JACK: even doughnuts, y'know. can push their luck.

QUOYLE: uh. i didn't. most of these 
QUOYLE: are for herry.
QUOYLE: there's two. are yours.
QUOYLE: you prob'ly want to wait for christmas.
WAVEY: oh, i'm much too excited.
QUOYLE: it's from a museum catalogue. but it's not real. it's a copy. wavey it is my favorite teapot.
QUOYLE: it's nice for your eyes. i thought.
QUOYLE: it's for everyday. you don't have to save it for special.
WAVEY: oh, i'll save this, all right.
WAVEY: and i'll think of you. when i
WAVEY: put lot on.
WAVEY: i don't make mistakes. about that kind of thing.
QUOYLE: it was so big, i thought it was a tea cozy for your car. but if it's for me, it has to be bigger, huh?
WAVEY: well. you'll grow into it.
QUOYLE: you kiddin'? after the holidays, we'll have to stretch it.
QUOYLE: not used to a woman. giving me presents.
QUOYLE: she raises a brow. can scarcely believe that.
QUOYLE: one christmas with petal, i gave her eleven things. and i wrapped them. and watched her open them up.
QUOYLE: she didn't have anything for me. like every year. but this one time, she said, 'wait a minute.' wait a minute.
QUOYLE: she ran to the kitchen. i heard the fridge open. she came back. with her hands hidden behind her. then, she held out...
QUOYLE: two brown eggs. she gave them to me from her own hands. they were cold.
QUOYLE: must sound really stupid. but they meant a lot to me.
WAVEY: well. it's the thought that counts.
QUOYLE: i broke 'em, careful. made her an omelette with 'em. and i saved the shells. in a little box. she can't help but show her surprise at that.
QUOYLE: oh, yeh. they're on a shelf behind my desk. at the paper.

WAVEY: i know how it is. to hold onto something good. in the middle of all the bad. 
QUOYLE: well. i gotta collect bunny. beety's gonna have supper waiting.

PRINCIPAL: worked hard to bring you the best pageant ever.

WAVEY: we all know billy pretty's ways. never save fifty cents, if you can save a dollar. 
WAVEY: well, last feb'ry, billy wants t'get his grandfather clock repaired. calls old leander mesher. local call. no charge.
WAVEY: well, says leander, the big cost is pickup and delivery. got t'charge fifty dollars, each way. two strong boys. gasoline. air in the tires!
WAVEY: there's no cost for air in yer tires!, says bill. get wi' th'times, he's told. tis called inflation!
WAVEY: billy lives at the top of the hill, leander at the bot tom, doncha know. so billy gets a rope, hoists the grandfather up on his back. and muttering the words fifty bucks...
WAVEY: mite slick. four feet thick a ice.
WAVEY: tears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more.

HEROLD: herold i can't undo the hurt i've done. unless you let me.
HEROLD: there's a million reasons to send me away. good ones. and only two reasons not to.
HEROLD: i love you. and you love me.

QUOYLE: we get so little mention in the wires. thought you'd like to see. 
QUOYLE: head in the suitcase. the mystery's solved.
QUOYLE: silver melville was captured in moored with a cruise steward. the boy was twenty, a looker, wearing armani clothes. driving a nice lexus.
QUOYLE: says she did it all for love.

AGNIS: she'd call me, time to time. husband was a pig. more women should do what she done. her situation. 
QUOYLE: some women. shoulda done it to their brother.
QUOYLE: mavis said you buried warren here. called it an anniversary.
AGNIS: of a loss. but not the dog.
AGNIS: what makes us do that, nephew? give ourselves away to someone. so we can't eat or think or breathe without 'em? quoyle i don't know. we just do.
AGNIS: wonderful, ain't it?
AGNIS: irene warren died. the mornin' after a christmas. we get one true love in life, nephew. she was mine.

AGNIS: don't mean we can't give love again. and get some back. 
QUOYLE: for some, it does. agnis not for me.
AGNIS: and if that ruffles some small town feathers...
QUOYLE: y'know what the feathers around here need th' most? a good ruffling, i say.
QUOYLE: y'know what i need th' most?
QUOYLE: a really big breakfast!

WAVEY: it was easy. i just kept thinkin'. how would petal do it? 
WAVEY: we're friends, right? friends drink together.
WAVEY: i asked a quest... quoyle i'll drink with you. if you're not done yet.
WAVEY: not drunk enough yet to talk about petal. which we always seem to do.
WAVEY: let's talk about me. which we don't.
WAVEY: growin' up, all i wanted from this place was out. imagine. give up all this.
WAVEY: i ran off to toronto, went to school. wanted to be a social worker. for kids.

WAVEY: came back one summer. fell for herold prowse. that. was that. 
WAVEY: did you know i was a liar?
WAVEY: herold liked other women. but you know how that is. sure you do. wavey he didn't die. not that he didn't deserve to.
WAVEY: see, i'm a good liar.
WAVEY: he ran off to seattle with some when his damaged son was two months old. and nobody knew.
WAVEY: like i said. it's four years ago. and it's yesterday.
WAVEY: so i took his boat out. i sunk it. and told my little story. grieving widow.
WAVEY: i was leaving, of course. why humiliate myself on the wayout? yes? wavey but a funny thing happened. on
WAVEY: my way out.
WAVEY: all these funny, odd little folks? they put their hearts around me. so i wouldn't be alone. having lost the man i loved.
WAVEY: and since i knew, to my shame, that is exactly what i had lost. i let go of the will to leave. i did.
WAVEY: decided to let my child grow up. around folks better than his mom.
WAVEY: you're quite the talker. quoyle i take pride in that.
WAVEY: well, this morning. the man i loved. came back.
WAVEY: told me he knew. i loved him still.
WAVEY: okay. now i'm drunk enough. to talk about petal.
WAVEY: you're thinking we're kindred souls, you and me. in love with our nightmares.

WAVEY: you don't love your petal. you hate. her cheating. guts. 
WAVEY: you have to think it's love. because if it's not, you're dead inside. so you keep that flame a flickering. cos it's all you'll ever have.
WAVEY: you see. you're a good liar, too.
WAVEY: where's the eggshells? that's all i came to see.
WAVEY: can you guess how i know about petal?
WAVEY: because you and i. are kindred souls. after all.
WAVEY: so i told my husband. to himself. and the ego he rode in on.

WAVEY: thanks for the mirror. 
WAVEY: if i don't see you. happy new year.

BUNNY: i think they're all here. 
QUOYLE: they're beautiful. i never saw 'em. all together.

BUNNY: will she be proud to wear 'em? 
QUOYLE: well. any woman would.

QUOYLE: you knew billy's dad? 
ALVIN: ever'body knows ever'body. but billy's pap didn't invent the four women in a man's life.
ALVIN: well. which one is bunny, i wonder? the maid in the meadow, mebbe.
ALVIN: doncha know? they're all the same woman. that's the point.
ALVIN: the maid in the meadow, that's her innocence and play. the stouthearted woman, is when you need to lean on her.
ALVIN: the tall and quiet woman? that's the silent partner who always walks 'longside, so's yer never alone.
ALVIN: and the demon lover. that's just the frostin' on th' cake.
ALVIN: when y'find the woman who's all four? that's when y'got yer one true love.
ALVIN: ...like m'gertie.

DENNIS: my dad went over the side this mornin'. tangled in th' sling- stone line. 
DENNIS: if you could write a memorial t' him. fer t'morrow's gammy bird?

DAWN: happy new year, mr. quoyle. i'm sorry i missed you at the pageant. 
DAWN: i was in the wings, a course. wasn't our girl somethin'?
DAWN: i say, y'have t'love a woman. who's in touch with her inner chicken.

AGNIS: nephew. you okay? 
BUNNY: he's okay. he's not sleeping in the box.
QUOYLE: remember what i told you.
BUNNY: if he's not sleeping. why do they call it a awake? he thinks. as if it is a worthwhile question.
QUOYLE: we're the ones have to be awake. to how much we love him...
QUOYLE: and how we should be good to each other. while we have the chance.
QUOYLE: you think?
BUNNY: he looks like he's sleeping.
QUOYLE: that's cos he's peaceful. no worries, anymore. no troubles.
QUOYLE: pocket...
QUOYLE: i found this in jack's drawer at the paper. i don't know if it's somethin' special...
MRS. BUGGIT: oh, it's his lodge pin. we were lookin' all over.
QUOYLE: you hungry? there's sandwi...
BUNNY: petal's peaceful, too.
QUOYLE: you bet. you can count on tha...
QUOYLE: new year's present.
QUOYLE: oh, yeh. it's a quoyle tradition.

BUNNY: that's a funny thing to say. for the first thing he said. 
QUOYLE: what? 'i'm keepin' m'damn lobster license'?
QUOYLE: maybe he just said it. to make your uncle dennis laugh so hard. you think?
QUOYLE: quoyle it's not fair, is it. that jack woke up. and petal didn't.
BUNNY: well. the world's not fair. you said.
QUOYLE: that's something the world is always teaching us. and sometimes, the learning comes later. that gets through. both adults can see it. quoyle you taught me that.
QUOYLE: you know. what we wait for? it's like the main stem of this boat. it gives us our shape.
QUOYLE: see, i know why you saved a place for petal. all this time.
QUOYLE: cos i'm the daddy. and you learn how to do. by watching me.
QUOYLE: you just watched. better than i knew.
QUOYLE: watch this.

WAVEY: i'm thanking your daddy. for all my presents. 
BUNNY: there was only two.
WAVEY: more than two. everything i need. except...
WAVEY: except a necklace.
BUNNY: i got a box of 'em. you could pick one.
BUNNY: then you'd have everything you need.
BUNNY: no.
