MRS. PILLETTI: she was here, you know, wednesday, and i said, "catherine, my sister..."
VIRGINIA: so she say, "you're spilling the milk." so she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk i spilled, so she got me so mad, so i said, "mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" so i took the bottle, and i threw it against the door. i didn't throw it at her. that's just something she made up. she goes around telling everybody i threw the bottla milk at her. i didn't throw it anywheres near her. well, i was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
MRS. PILLETTI: well, i don't know what you want me to do, virginia. if you want me, i'll go talk to her tonight.

MRS. PILLETTI: she's right. she's right. young husband and wife, they should have their own home. and my sister catherine, she's my sister, but i gotta admit, she's an old goat. and plenty-a times in my life, i feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. and i tell you now, as far as i'm concerned, if catherine wantsa come live here with me and marty, it's all right with me.

DR. KEEGAN: she's all right, andy. it's just that i get one saturday night off every three weeks, and i was expecting something better, that's all.
ANDY: i told you she wasn't attractive...
DR. KEEGAN: you told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
ANDY: millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so i...
DR. KEEGAN: all right, i'm having a fair time. it's just that i get one saturday night off in three weeks, and i wanted to wind up with something tonight.

DR. KEEGAN: hey! 
GIRL: herbie! wadda you doing here?!

DR. KEEGAN: i'll see you around.
GIRL: i'll see you.
DR. KEEGAN: that's a girl used to know.

ANDY: boy, it's packed in here. 
MILLIE: some of these kids are awful young. aren't you afraid you'll bump into one of your students?
CLARA: i wouldn't think so. i teach out in brooklyn.
ANDY: you been up here before, clara?
CLARA: yeah, twice.
MILLIE: shall we try to get a table and get something to drink or shall we just go in and start dancing?
ANDY: hey, herbie...

ANDY: you wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
DR. KEEGAN: listen. you people go grab a table. i'll be back inna minute. i'll be right back.

CLARA: all right.

ANGIE: not a bad crowd tonight, you know? 
MARTY: there was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
ANGIE: there's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
MARTY: where?
ANGIE: down there. that little one there.

MARTY: yeah, she looks all right from here. 
ANGIE: well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? i'll take the one inna green dress.
MARTY: i think this number is a little fast. wait a minute.
MARTY: it's all right, i think. they still there?

MARTY: excuse me, would you care for this dance? 
SHORT GIRL: i don't feel like dancing just yet.
MARTY: sure.

MARTY: you say something? 
DR. KEEGAN: yeah. i was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
MARTY: i'm stag.
DR. KEEGAN: well, i'll tell you. i got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and i just met an old girl i used to know, and i was wondering how i'm gonna get rid of the girl i'm with. somebody to take her home, you know what i mean? i'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
MARTY: what?
DR. KEEGAN: i'll take you over, and i'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then i'll cut out. because i got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and i'll pay you five bucks.
MARTY: are you kidding?
DR. KEEGAN: no, i'm not kidding.
MARTY: you can't just walk off onna girl like that.

DR. KEEGAN: ...in that case, as long as she's going home alone, give me the five bucks back... 
STAG: look, mac, you paid me the five bucks. i was willing. it's my five bucks...

MRS. PILLETTI: is catherine here? 
VIRGINIA: we didn't tell her anything yet. we thought that we'd leave it to you. we thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. do you want tommy and me to stay here with you?
MRS. PILLETTI: i think it be a better idea if you and thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
THOMAS: hello, aunt theresa.
MRS. PILLETTI: hello, thomas.
THOMAS: i just this minute got the baby to sleep.
THOMAS: aunt theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? and wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
MRS. PILLETTI: don't worry. i'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
CATHERINE'S VOICE: who's there?! who's there?!
CATHERINE: hey! what are you doing here?
MRS. PILLETTI: i came to see you. how you feel?
CATHERINE: i gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
MRS. PILLETTI: i been getting a pain in my shoulder.
CATHERINE: i gotta pains in my shoulder too. i have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much i can't sleep. it's a curse to be old. how you feel?
MRS. PILLETTI: i feel fine.
CATHERINE: that's nice.

MRS. PILLETTI: well, how's everything with you? 
MRS. PILLETTI: my son marty's fine. everybody's fine...
MRS. PILLETTI: we gotta postcard from my son nickie and his bride. they're inna big hotel in florida on their honeymoon. everything is very nice.

CATHERINE: i wake up this morning, i hear the baby crying. so i wake up. i come in their room. that girl is shaking her hand atta baby. i said, "you brute! don't you strike that baby! that's my son's baby!"
MRS. PILLETTI: it's her baby too, you know.

MRS. PILLETTI: catherine, i want you come live in my house with marty and me.
CATHERINE: ah?
MRS. PILLETTI: you son thomas and virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
CATHERINE: who?
MRS. PILLETTI: your son thomas and his wife virginia...
CATHERINE: when was this?
MRS. PILLETTI: this afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
CATHERINE: what they say?
MRS. PILLETTI: you know what they say. they say things are no good in this house. catherine, your son is married. leave him in peace. he wantsa be alone with his wife. they don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. now i tell you what i think. i want you come live with me in my house with marty and me. in my house, you have your own room. you don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. we will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. you are dear to me, and you are dear to marty. we are pleased for you to come.
CATHERINE: my son thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
MRS. PILLETTI: catherine, don't make an opera outta this. the three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. you are an old goat, and she has an italian temper. she is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. catherine, you are no fool. you know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
CATHERINE: so i am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
MRS. PILLETTI: oh, catherine, please! don't make a tragedy. you come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
CATHERINE: it pains that they should do this.
MRS. PILLETTI: i know it pains.
CATHERINE: these are the worst years, i tell you.
MRS. PILLETTI: catherine, you are very dear to me. we have cried many times together. when my husband died, i would have gone insane if it were not for you. i ask you to come to my house, because i can make you happy. please come to my house.
CATHERINE: these are the worst years. i tell you. it's gonna happen to you. i'm afraida look inna mirror. i'm afraid i'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. i'm fifty- six years old. what am i to do with myself? i have strength in my hands. i wanna cook. i wanna clean. i wanna make dinner for my children. am i an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? these are the terrible years, theresa! terrible years!
MRS. PILLETTI: catherine, my sister... catherine stares distraught at mrs. pilletti.
CATHERINE: it's gonna happen to you! it's gonna happen to you! what will you do if marty gets married?! what will you cook? what happen to alla children playing in alla rooms? where is the noise?! it is a curse to be a widow! a curse. what will you do if marty gets married?! what will you do?

MARTY: you come up here often? 
CLARA: i was up here twice before. once with a friend of mine and once i came up alone. the last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
MARTY: yeah.
CLARA: well, the last time i was up here, that's where i sat. i sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. i'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. then i began to cry, and i had to get up and go home.
MARTY: i cry a lot too. i'm a big cryer.
CLARA: this is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
MARTY: oh, i cry all the time, any little thing. my brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy i am. well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. you get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. i know exactly how you feel. and i also want you to know i'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. so you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
CLARA: i'm having a very good time, too.
MARTY: so there you are. so i guess i'm not such a dog as i think i am.
CLARA: you're a very nice guy, and i don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
MARTY: i don't know either. i think i'm a very nice guy. i also think i'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
MARTY: now i figure, two people get married, and they gonna live together forty, fifty years. so it's just gotta be more than whether they're good looking or not. you tell me you think you're not very good-looking. my father was a really ugly man, but my mother adored him. she told me that she used to get so miserable sometimes, like everybody, you know? and she says my father always tried to understand. i used to see them sometimes when i was a kid, sitting in the living room, talking and talking, and i used to adore my old man, because he was so kind. that's one of the most beautiful things i have in my life, the way my father and mother were. and my father was a real ugly man. so it doesn't matter if you look like a gorilla. so you see, dogs like us, we ain't such dogs as we think we are.
CLARA: i'm twenty-nine years old. how old are you?
MARTY: i'm thirty-four.

MARTY: ...you teach chemistry? that's funny. where? what school? 
CLARA: benjamin franklin high school.
MARTY: benjamin franklin, where's that? brooklyn? i went to theodore roosevelt right up here on fordham road. it's right arounna corner from my house. i have a cousin who's a teacher. he teaches latin. he lives in chicago. he was studying to be a jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.

MARTY: you know what i was good at in high school? i was good in math. you know how long ago i graduated high school? june, nineteen-thirty-seven. holy cow! june, nineteen-thirty-seven! what is that? fifteen, seventeen years ago! holy cow! seventeen years ago! is that right? seventeen, that's right. where did it all go? i'm getting old. i'm gonna be thirty- five november eighth. thirty-five. wow. time goes on, boy. 
MARTY: nineteen-thirty-seven... that's right. my old man died december, nineteen- thirty-seven.

MARTY: two o'clock in the morning he died. the doorbell rings, and i knew something was wrong right away. because my room is onna ground floor inna front, you see, and i got outta bed, and i answered the door... 
MARTY: there was mr. stern. he had a house down about a block from us. he moved out though. my old man, he used to play cards with him and some other old guys. he's a jewish feller. so he said, "is your mother home?" so i knew right away there was something wrong. i was only eighteen, exactly eighteen years old, just the month before. so i said, "is something wrong, mr. stern?" i was in my pajamas, you know? so he said, "marty, your father died." my father died right inna middle of playing cards, right at the table. he had a heart attack. he had low blood pressure, my old man. he used to faint a lot.
MARTY: boy, am i talking, i never talked so much in my life. usually, everybody comes to me and tells me all their troubles. well, i'm gonna shut up now, and i'm gonna let you get a word in...
MARTY: seventeen years ago. what i been doing with myself all that time?... well, i'm talking again. i must be driving you crazy. mosta the time i'm with a girl, i can't find a word to say. well, i'm gonna shut up now. because i'm not like this usually. usually, i... well, here i go again.
MARTY: i can't shut my mouth... i'm on a jag, for pete's sake. you'd think i was loaded...
MARTY: i can't stop talking! isn't this stupid?!
MARTY: you gotta real nice face, you know? it's really a nice face.
CLARA: thank you.

MARTY: ...so i'm inna kneeling position, and if you ever try shooting a bar inna kneeling position, you know what i mean. i can't holda steady position. i'm wavering back and forth... 
MARTY: ...so the guy next to me, he's shooting from the prone position, and he's cross-eyed like i told you...
MARTY: so just then...
MARTY: so my target goes down, and a minute later, the flag comes up. i got five bulls-eyes. this cross-eyed guy next to me, he shot five bulls-eyes into my target...
MARTY: ...so i said to the sergeant who was checking my score, "pretty good, eh, sarge? five bulls-eyes? so this sergeant, he don't know what happened, he says, "say, that's all right, pilletti"...
MARTY: oh, man. so that's what happened. that's how i got the reputation-a being the best shot inna whole battalion... oh, man...

BUCKO: anything good in there, mac? 
ANGIE: a buncha dogs.

MARTY: ...when i got outta the army, clara, i was lost. i didn't know what i wanted to do. i was twenny-five years old, what was i gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. i thought maybe i go to college under the g.i. biller rights, you know? but i wouldn't graduate till i was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if i made it in three years. and my brother freddie wanted to get married, and i had three unmarried sisters -- in an italian home, that's a terrible thing. and my kid brother nickie, he's a one got married last week. so i just went to pieces. i used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. my mother used to be so worried about me. my uncle mario come over one time. he offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. he got his own cab, you know. and forgive me for what i'm gonna say now, but i used to thinka doing away with myself. i used to stand sometimes in the subway, and forgive me what i'm going to say, i used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels. 
CLARA: yes, i know.
MARTY: i'm a catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
CLARA: yes, i know.
MARTY: so then mr. gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. so that's what happened. i didn't wanna be a butcher.
CLARA: there's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
MARTY: well, i wouldn't call it an elegant profession. it's in a lower social scale. people look down on butchers.
CLARA: i don't.
MARTY: well, the point is mr. gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to california in los angeles and live near their married daughter. because she's always writing them to come out there. so it's a nice little shop. i handle his books for him, so i know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. the point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. there's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an aandp coming in, at least that's the rumor. of course, mosta his trade is strictly italian, but the younger italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old italian dishes so much. i mean, you gotta take that into account too.
CLARA: it's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, marty.
MARTY: that's true. i do. but i'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. that's a big note to carry, because i have to give mr. gazzara a mortgage, and what i have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than i can make onna salary?
CLARA: marty, i know you for three hours, but i know you're a good butcher. you're an intelligent, sensitive, decent man. i have a feeling about you like sometimes a kid comes in to see me for one reason or another. and some of these kids, marty, in my classes, they have so much warmth in them, so much capacity. and that's the feeling i get about you.
CLARA: if you were one of my students, i would say, "go ahead and buy the butcher shop. you're a good butcher." clara pauses.
MARTY: well, there's a lotta things i could do with this shop. i could organize my own supermarket. get a buncha neighborhood merchants together. that's what a lotta them are doing.
MARTY: wadda you think?
CLARA: i think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
MARTY: i'm catholic. are you catholic?
CLARA: yes, i am.
MARTY: i only got about three bucks on me now, but i just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of webster avenue. why don't we walk back to my house? i'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
CLARA: i really should get home...
MARTY: it's only a quarter of twelve. the clock's right over there.
CLARA: i really should get home, i told my father... well, i suppose a little while longer. i wonder if there's any place around here i could put some makeup on...
MARTY: hey, mac!
MARTY: you gotta ladies' room around here?
PROPRIETOR: inna back.
MARTY: inna back.

FIRST IRISH WOMAN: ...so she told me that the doctor told her that if she had any more babies, she would do so at the risk of her life... 
SECOND IRISH WOMAN: she was always a bit thin in the hips...
FIRST IRISH WOMAN: well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. every time i saw the woman, she was either...
ANGIE: hey, lou!
FIRST IRISH WOMAN: ...going to the hospital or coming from it. she was hatching them out like eggs.
SECOND IRISH WOMAN: and that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
FIRST IRISH WOMAN: well, i bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
ANGIE: hey, lou!
BARTENDER: what?
FIRST IRISH WOMAN: ...so i said to her, "mary...
ANGIE: marty been in here the last coupla hours or so?
FIRST IRISH WOMAN: "...mary, for heaven's sakes, didn't you tell me that another one'll kill you?"
BARTENDER: i ain't seen marty all night...
SECOND IRISH WOMAN: and her husband is a little bit of a man, isn't he?
ANGIE: where is everybody? i been walking around, i can't find anybody...
FIRST IRISH WOMAN: well, last week tuesday, she gave birth to the baby in saint elizabeth's hospital... a big healthy boy of nine pounds...
SECOND IRISH WOMAN: oh, that's nice. so the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
FIRST IRISH WOMAN: oh, no! she died right in the hospital...
SECOND IRISH WOMAN: oh, that's a sad story. and her husband is that little fellow, works in peter reeves.
FIRST IRISH WOMAN: that's the one.
SECOND IRISH WOMAN: oh, that's a sad story.

CLARA: ...it's really a fine opportunity for me. but i'm not sure i want to be a department head. it's mostly executive and administrative work. well, anyway, i told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and... 
MARTY: why don't you just move out to portchester?
CLARA: well, that's what i was saying. my father is getting old. and we're very close. he's a wonderful man, really...
MARTY: i think you're kidding yourself, clara. i used to think about moving out, you know? and that's what i used to say. "my mother needs me." but when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. actually, you need your father. you know what i mean? you're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
CLARA: i'm afraid of being lonely.
MARTY: oh, you won't be so lonely. you'll make friends right away.
CLARA: actually, i don't make friends easily.
MARTY: what're you talking about? you're a real likeable person. you'll make friends out there in portchester one, two, three. you'll have people visiting you alla time. i'll come visit you. i'll borrow my brother freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or i'll call you up. and it's gonna be nice. don't be so afraid.

MARTY: so i was telling you, my kid brother nickie got married last sunday. that was a very nice affair. and they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. i never saw anything so grand in my life. and watta meal. i'm a butcher, so i know a good hunka steak when i see one. that was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. a buck eighty a pound. of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. that gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. listen, clara, make yourself comfortable. you're all tense.
CLARA: oh, i'm fine.
MARTY: you want me to take you home, i'll take you home.

MARTY: i'm old enough to know better. comes new year's eve, everybody starts arranging parties, i'm the guy they gotta dig up a date for. let me getta packa cigarettes, and i'll take you home. 
CLARA: i'd like to see you again. very much. the reason i didn't let you kiss me was because i just didn't know how to handle the situation. you're the kindest man i ever met. the reason i tell you this is because i want to see you again very much. i know that when you take me home, i'm going to just lie on my bed and think about you. i want very much to see you again.
MARTY: waddaya doing tomorrow night?
CLARA: nothing.
MARTY: i'll call you up tomorrow morning. maybe, we'll go see a movie.
CLARA: i'd like that very much.
MARTY: the reason i can't be definite about it now is my aunt catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and i may have to help out.
CLARA: i'll wait for your call.
MARTY: we better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
CLARA: all right.
MARTY: i'll just get a packa cigarettes.
MARTY: waddaya doing new year's eve?
CLARA: nothing.
MRS. PILLETTI'S VOICE: hallo! hallo! marty?!
MRS. PILLETTI: hello, marty, when you come home?
MARTY: we just got here about fifteen minutes ago. ma, i want you to meet miss clara snyder. she's graduate of new york university. she teaches chemistry in benjamin franklin high school.
MRS. PILLETTI: siddown, siddown. you want some chicken? we got some chicken in the ice box.
CLARA: no, mrs. pilletti. we were just going home. thank you very much anyway.
MRS. PILLETTI: well, siddown a minute. i just come inna house. i'll take off my coat. siddown a minute.
MARTY: how'd you come home, ma? thomas give you a ride?
MRS. PILLETTI: oh, it's a sad business. my sister, catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
MARTY: oh, she's coming, eh, ma?
MRS. PILLETTI: oh, sure. siddown, siddown. marty, tell her siddown.
MARTY: might as well siddown a minute, clara.
MRS. PILLETTI: did you offer the young lady some fruit?
MARTY: i offered her, ma, she don't want nothing.
CLARA: no, thank you, really, mrs. pilletti.
MRS. PILLETTI: it's a very sad business, i tell you. a woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. it's a curse to be a mother, i tell you. your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? what is a mother's life but her children? it is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
CLARA: couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
MRS. PILLETTI: hobby! what can she do? she cooks and she cleans. you gotta have a house to clean. you gotta have children to cook for. these are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
CLARA: you mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. she also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
MRS. PILLETTI: you don't think my sister catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
CLARA: well, i don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, i don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
MRS. PILLETTI: where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
CLARA: i don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
MRS. PILLETTI: well, maybe that's what they teach you in new york university. in real life, it don't work out that way. you wait till you are a mother.
CLARA: it's silly of me to argue about it. i don't know the people involved.
MARTY: ma, i'm gonna take her home now. it's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
MRS. PILLETTI: sure.
CLARA: it was very nice meeting you, mrs. pilletti. i hope i'll see you again.
MRS. PILLETTI: sure.
MARTY: all right, ma. i'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.

THOMAS: wadda you so sore about?
VIRGINIA: oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
MARTY: so thomas, he does about twelve, thirteen hundred gross. rent's a hundred and two. the problem, of course, is the supermarkets. that's what i wanna ask you. if i get together with a coupla other merchants, make our own supermarket...
THOMAS: what about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
VIRGINIA: waddaya talking about?!!
THOMAS: once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
VIRGINIA: i told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
THOMAS: ...you hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
VIRGINIA: she don't wanna use my pots and pans!
MARTY: so tommy...
VIRGINIA: waddaya want me to do, go out and buy a whole new setta pots and pans?!
MARTY: tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because i promised mr. gazzara i'd let him know tomorrow. see, what i wanna know, tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? on individual mark- ups? you know what i mean? say i'm the butcher and aldo capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose i mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
THOMAS: waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
MARTY: no, i don't know. that's why i'm asking you.
THOMAS: take the baby, will you?!
THOMAS: wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? you gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. boy, i wish i was you, boy. waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? what's he want? five thousand down? you're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. a mortgage anna note from the bank. for pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. stay that way, boy. take my advice.
MARTY: well, you see, thomas i figure the big problem is the supermarkets. but patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. the supermarkets don't carry italian meat.
THOMAS: who buys italian meat anymore? you think my wife buys italian meat? she goes to the aandp, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
VIRGINIA: sure, all you wanna eat is that greasy stuff your mother makes.
MARTY: well, i understand the problem about the supermarkets, but i was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
THOMAS: marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
MARTY: sure. this girl said...
THOMAS: what girl, what does she know? why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
VIRGINIA: your mother handles the kid like he was a yoyo!

MRS. PILLETTI: hey, i come home from your house last night, marty was here with a girl. 
CATHERINE: who?

MRS. PILLETTI: well, what marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
CATHERINE: were the lights on?
MRS. PILLETTI: oh sure. this girl is a college graduate.
CATHERINE: they're the worst. college girls are one step from the streets. they smoke like men inna saloon. my son joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. one step from the streets, i tell you. mrs. pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
MRS. PILLETTI: that's the first time marty ever brought a girl to this house. she seems like a nice girl. i think he has a feeling for this girl. you heard him sing. he been singing like that all morning.
CATHERINE: well, that's all. you will see. today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "hey, ma, it's no good being a single man. i'm tired-a running around." then he's gonna say, "hey, ma, wadda we need this old house? why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? a nice little apartment?"
MRS. PILLETTI: i don't sell this house, i tell you that. this is my husband's house. i had six children in this house.
CATHERINE: you will see. a coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
MRS. PILLETTI: catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. wherever you are, the rain follows. someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
MARTY: hello, ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
MRS. PILLETTI: sure.
MARTY: boy, this place is really coming to pieces. you know, ma, i think we oughta sell this place. the whole joint's going to pieces. the plumbing is rusty. everything. i'm gonna have to replaster the whole ceiling now. you know what we oughta do? we oughta get one of those new apartments they're building down on southern boulevard. a nicer parta town, you know?...you all set, ma?

MARTY: what, ma?
MRS. PILLETTI: she looks thirty-five, forty. she didn't look italian to me.
MRS. PILLETTI: i said, is she italian girl?
MARTY: i don't know. i don't think so.
MRS. PILLETTI: she don't look italian to me. what kinda family she come from? there was something about her i didn't like. it seems funny, the first time you meet her, she comes to your empty house alone. these college girls, they all one step fromma streets.
MARTY: what are you talking about? she's a nice girl.
MRS. PILLETTI: she didn't look italian to me.
MRS. PILLETTI: i don't like her.
MARTY: you don't like her. you only met her for two minutes.
MRS. PILLETTI: don't bring her to the house no more.
MARTY: what didn't you like about her?
MRS. PILLETTI: i don't know! she don't look like italian to me. plenny a nice italian girls around.
MARTY: well, let's not get inna fight about it, ma.
MARTY: what are you getting so worked up about? i just met the girl last night. i'm probably not gonna see her again.

MARTY: hello, lou, angie come in yet? 
BARTENDER: he was here last night till about two o'clock. i hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
MARTY: who told you that?
BARTENDER: angie. he says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.

MARTY: oh, i hadda nice time...i didn't try nothing. she's a nice girl. i just met her last night, you know. i just talked with her. i didn't even try nothing...
MARTY: listen, you see angie, tell him i went home, i'll meet him after lunch.

JOE: ...so the whole book winds up, mike hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. so he says, "you rat, you are the murderer." so she begins to con him, you know? she tells him how she loves him. and then bam! he shoots her in the stomach. so she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "how could you do that?" and he says, "it was easy." 
LEO: boy, that mickey spillane, boy he can write.
MARTY: we gotta whole pot inna kitchen. we give you a plate-a your own.
ANGIE: oh, i couldn't eat nothing. my mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
JOE: what i like about mickey spillane is he knows how to handle women. in one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. and then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. and then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
LEO: boy, that mickey spillane, he sure can write.
ANGIE: listen, somebody turn onna ballgame. it must be after one o'clock by now.
ANGIE: who you gonna call?
MARTY: i was gonna call that girl from last night. take her to a movie tonight.
ANGIE: are you kidding?
MARTY: listen, angie, i wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. i introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. now, why did you do that?
ANGIE: you got me mad, that's why. hey, joe, show marty that picture.
MARTY: put that away, for pete's sake. my mother's right out onna porch.
JOE: i wonder where they find those girls that pose for them pictures.
LEO: those are hollywood starlets.
MARTY: put it away, joe. my mother'll come walking in.
ANGIE: marty, let's go downna seventy-second street area tonight.
MARTY: i don't feel like going, angie. i thought i'd take this girl to a movie.
ANGIE: boy, you really musta made out good last night.
MARTY: we just talked.
ANGIE: boy, she musta been some talker. she musta been about fifty years old.
JOE: i always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
LEO: that means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
JOE: i never thoughta that.
MARTY: i didn't think she was so bad-looking.
ANGIE: she musta kept you inna shadows all night.
RALPH: marty, you don't wanna hang around with dogs. it gives you a bad reputation.
ANGIE: let's go downa seventy-second street.
MARTY: i told this dog i was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
ANGIE: brush her. listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
MARTY: waddaya getting so sore about?
ANGIE: i looked all over for you last night, you know that?
JOE: another book that i read by mickey spillane, i can't remember the name of it, but it was about this red- headed tramp he finds inna street, and he gives her some dough, because he's sorry for her... wait a minute, i think that's the same book i was telling you about before...
MARTY: you didn't like her at all?
ANGIE: a nothing. a real nothing.
JOE'S VOICE: you know something...?
JOE'S VOICE: ...i can't tell one-a those mickey spillane books from the other, but he's a real good writer, though...
