CLARA: that's exactly the one i picked!
PHIL: man, i wish i was them.

CLARA: i just... when i was growing up my mom and dad had a picture just like this. now they can't even acknowledge each other. 
CLARA: let's always remember to have some time that's just for the two of us. no matter what else comes up in our lives - if it's work or friends or when we have kids-
PHIL: we're having kids? with an "s"?
PHIL: ok fine. but i promise you it's never gonna happen to us.
CLARA: yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that when i'm long in the tooth.
PHIL: you'll be even hotter long toothed. right now to be honest clara they're a little stumpy.

CLARA: phil. tell me it wasn't the pictures. 
PHIL: wasn't the pictures.
CLARA: you know how long that took?
PHIL: we'll fix the picture piles, clara. we've got all the time in the world. from now on everything's gonna be just about us.

CLARA: hey jane? i'm getting a late start but i'll be there as soon as i can.
PHIL: sorry i dropped the ball. it's this quarterly report to mr. rivers today. you know how he freaks me out with all of his mixed animal metaphors that i don't

PHIL: did you hear me? 
CLARA: uh huh. he freaks you out with his mixed animal metaphors that you don't understand. banana ollie?
PHIL: so i should probably get going. with the highway construction it takes forever to get downtown these days.
CLARA: ok. have a good day.
CLL. --: sorry. your mouthy was still ail milky.
PHIL: sorry for the milky mouth.

CHAZ: well, well! we're up bright and early, aren't we! 
PHIL: yes we are!

JANE: his name's juan and he's some kind of spanish, i think. he knows all these exclusive, underground places downtown. 
JANE: i never knew i could still get my leg back that far.
CLARA: too much information, jane.

JANE: with larry, i lost that. everything had just become routine, you know? boring. 
JANE: but now, all of a sudden i'm alive again!
CLARA: good for you, jane.
CLARA: good for you.

JANE: there's this g---eat restaurant downtown we went to the ot__ar night that you guys would love. _"st amazing view of the city. you guys should check it out on your next date night. 
CLARA: yeah, well, maybe. we don't really have those that much anymore.
JANE: 't have date nights:
CLARA: , you know, we're pretty tired all the time between work and ollie. and some of the shows on tv these days are really great.

CLAM: i know that's really lame. 
JANE: so it's phil?
CLARA: no, it's not phil. it's the both of us.
JANE: so why don't you change it? all you have to do is stir things up and have one great, sexy, exciting night again.
CLARA: i guess. maybe.
JANE: not maybe. tonight.
CLARA: nah. tonight's no good.

PHIL: i'm sorry i'm late. the construction on the highways is insane these days! 
MR. RIVERS: don't worry about it, phil. it's fine. catch your breath.
MR. RIVERS: uh, phil. listen, before we start... i've been thinking... this next quarter we need to venture into open tundra.
PHIL: uh. ok. you mean... take the fund in a more high risk direction?
MR.: yeah. that's wha: i - -aid. sure. ok, fine. i can work up some higher risk options and come back tomorrow.

MR. RIVERS: ok. the thing is phil, tomorrow i want george to give me his thoughts on where we need to be hunting too. 
PHIL: oh.
MR. RIVERS: s nothing personal.
MR. RIVERS: so let me get this straight. you're telling me that tomorrow i'm going to have to interview for the job i already have? against george?
MR. RIVERS: i wouldn't put it like that. i just need our pack leader to be more like... like a momma kangaroo. ya get me?
PHIL: kinda.
PHIL: actually, no. not really at all.

MR. RIVERS: the blind baby kangaroo opens its mouth and knows its momma's teat is just always there, ready to suckle. but at the same time, momma kangaroo's still a wild, dangerous creature. 
PHIL: sorry. still not totally getting you.
MR. RIVERS: i've had a wife and a family. three of them. it's hard to stay the fastest cheetah when you need to mind the pack, phil. george lives in the city, doesn't have a family to worry about. he can rip the meat.
PHIL: listen, mr. rivers. i don't need to... i was ripping big hunks of meat and eating them like tartare when george was still... in the jungle!
MR. RIVERS: what does that mean?
PHIL: i can't be demoted, mr. rivers. i just can't.
MR. RIVERS: listen, nothing's set. it's just i gotta say that lately your leadership on this has felt a little... well... tame.
PHIL: that's all you needed to say, mr. rivers! i'll see you tomorrow.

CLARA: thanks mom. i really appreciate it. 
FEMALE VOICE: mrs. foster?
CLARA: oh, that's ollie's teacher. i'll see you later.
CLARA: i've been meaning to tell you that you can just call me clara, mrs. cardigan.
MRS. CARDIGAN: i'd prefer mrs. foster. boundaries matter.

MRS. CARDIGAN: can we speak a moment? alone? 
CLARA: sure, sure. ollie, go to the car.
CLARA: is everything ok?
MRS. CARDIGAN: well, i'm afraid not. oliver's been antagonizing the girls in the class a great deal lately. especially jenny diggs.
CLARA: really? oh no. why do you think that's happening?
MRS. CARDIGAN: i'm going to leave that to you and your nd to figure out. but beyond that, ,i: overall attitude these days is just... sub par. e

MRS. CARDIGAN: his penmanship is sloppy. he lacks motivation and tries to just "get by" o assignments. you know, this is a very competitive school, mrs. foster. in my opinion, maybe you should consider whether this is really the right environment for him. 
CLARA: uh... wow. ok.
CLARA: wow. what a
OLLIE: did you just call mrs. cardigan a
CLARA: remembering ollie's in the
BACK): no.
OL LIE: yeah you did.

PHIL: on a school night? why? 
OLLIE: mom says you guys are going out.
PHIL: tonight? what? no.
PHIL: clara?
PHIL: clara? cl-
PHIL: wow. wow.

CLARA: i thought i could take you out to celebrate you finally getting that report in. a romantic dinner downtown like the old days, and teen... ollie's going to stay at mom's so we have the house all to ourselves. all night. 
PHIL: wow... it sounds... great.
CLARA: great!
PHIL: it's just... is there any chance we coul take a rain check?
CLARA: a "rain check"?
PHIL: yeah. unfortunately i really need to do a bit of work tonight. e

CLARA: i thought all the cramming was for this report today. did something go wrong? 
PHIL: uh, no. nothing like that. i just decided i could play with it a little more. make it a little better.
CLARA: oh. ok.
PHIL: listen, i'm sorry...
CLARA: you don't need to apologize, phil.
PHIL: listen, if i had more warning-
E C: then something else would have come up. you know it. that's the thing, phil. we used to do things on the spur of the moment all the time. even after ollie was born. now we never do anything together.
PHIL: listen... any other night.
CLARA: ok. maybe another time. let me just get out of this and call my mom then.

PHIL: that dress really wasn't playing fair, clara. 
PHIL: well get a move on, girl!

RUTH: hey sweeties. 
RUTH: phil.
PHIL: ruth.
RUTH: nana rented us a special treat tonight before bed, ollie! the wizard of oz!
PHIL,: wow. wizard of oz. don't you think that's a little scary for a 5 year old?
RUTH: no, phil, i don't.
PHIL: ok... not so sure about that.

PHIL: clara? what do you think? 
RUTH: yeah, clara. what do you think?

CLARA: i'm sorry, phil. i just felt like she's doing us a favor tonight. 
PHIL: fine. fine.
CLARA: you know, i should pee before we go.
PHIL: ok. sure.
PHIL: i'll just wait in the car as you go back e inside to pee. again.

CLARA: you're hot? 
PHIL: yeah. that's why i turned on the air.

CLARA: you know, mrs. cardigan told me today that ollie's been antagonizing his daughter. 
PHIL: antagonizing? how does a five year old "antagonize?" i'm sure she wouldn't have mentioned it if it wasn't "the mayor's daughter."
CL: she also went on that ollie's penmanship's sloppy and he's not motivated enough.
PHIL: i think he's fine.
CLARA: she actually had the gall to suggest we should think about sending him somewhere else.
PHIL: maybe she's right if the school has that kind of attitude.
CL RA: you know what? all we ever end up talking about is ollie or work. let's just focus on us tonight.

CLARA: so what are you thinking about? 
PHIL: right now? traffic.
CLARA: oh. well, i heard this unbelievable story from jane today.
PHIL: yeah?
CLARA: she has this old classmate who went into labor with her second child the other day. she's totally healthy and everything's normal with the pregnancy. so she goes into labor and walks into the emergency room, and the second the nurses and attendants see her come in, they go into a panic and start yelling a,la! atmia!

PHIL: what's ama? 
CLARA: advanced maternal age!
PHIL: no! you've got to be joking me!
CLARA: kid you not!
PHIL: that's unbelievable!
CLARA: i know.
CLARA: the funny thing is she's my age, actually.
PHIL: huh.

PHIL: i thought you were cold. 
CLARA: i was, but then you turned it down and i got hot.
PHIL: but i turned it down because... you see when you open and close your vents it makes my... never mind.
CL AAA: what are you doing?
PHIL: i'm just gonna take a shortcut.
CLARA: phil, please don't. you think they're shortcuts but they always take longer.
PHIL: clara, please just trust me, ok

PHIL: now? 
CLARA: what?
PHIL: nothing.
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS: good evening. welcome to the signature room.

SUPERMODEL HOSTESS: have an eight minute grace period.
PHIL: you have an eight minute grace period? how did you come up with an eight minute grace period?
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS: i just work here,
PHIL: so what if someone's 9 minutes late?
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS: we're allowed to give a two minute grace on the grace.

PHIL: ok. which adds up to ten minutes! we're 11 minutes late. that's just one minute later than the grace on the grace. 
SUPERMODEL HOSTESS: i'm sorry sir, but management specifically said no grace on the grace on the grace. after ten minutes, we send a host around calling your name and if there's no answer, we give the table away. sorry.

GALE PARTY?: clara sighs, frustrated. 
CLARA: i mean, did you try something like telling her it was our anniversary, or my birthday, or slipping her some money-
PHIL: oh, i see. lying and graft were the answer!

PHIL: you're not even listening to me, are you? 
CLARA: yeah i am. you're sure if i had been there instead of peeing again i would have done it better.
25: clara, just because you can repeat the words i say doesn't mean you're-

SPEAKERPHONE: we need to discuss your little stunt tonight first, mr. and mrs. "gale." or should we say... what is it harry?
HARRY: phil and clara foster.
PHIL: that's what this is abo
SPEAKERPHONE: else would it be about, mr. foster
SPEAKERPHONE: wait. `'this a joke, right? some funny little bald guy's gonna jump out and scare us and say, "gotcha!" or somethi ok, where is he? where's that guy?
SPEAKERPHONE: you think this is a joke?
PHIL: no. are you insane?!? you don't drug people and tie them up for that! this i i just- i hope you know this is gonna go way beyond a review in za i'm seriously off!

SPEAKERPHONE: yes. well, i'm a little upset as well, mr. foster. and confused. it would help me to know why a couple like the two of you would try to pull something like this. 
T NT. WAREHOUSE: phil's now getting really annoyed.
PHIL: you must be kidding! like a million people don't do it every single night of the week! this is unbelievable! i'm just in shock here!
SPEAKERPHONE: i enjoy your humor, mr. foster. now why don't you start by telling me how you got into the rainbow to set it ud-
PHIL: "into the rainbow?" what the hell's that? restaurant code?

SPEAKERPHONE: -and then you can tell me where the photos are that you arranged to bring tonight. 
PHIL: photos?

SPEAKERPHONE: know you're not the gales.
PHIL: they know we're not the gales. don't you get it!
CLARA: no, phil. i think they think we're actually "the gales" who made the reservation tonight.

PHIL: ohhhhhh. oh. no. she's right. we're not those gales. you've got the wrong people. really. 
SPEAKERPHONE: then why were you two at the gales' table, mr. foster?
PHIL: ok, listen, what happened is we lost our reservation and when the host came around yelling the gales' name and no one answered, my wife said that we were them. i swear on my life to you that's what happened.
SPEAKEFP IC: you're saying you just took someone else's reservation you didn't know?
PHIL: i know that seems really weird. listen, i agree, that's what i said to her.
FRANK: one problem with your story. when i came over to the table - and you guys were all alone - you were still calling each other gale.
PHIL: that was just... we were... no, you don't understand...
SPEAKERPHONE: we'll need to move things along, frank.
PHIL: wait a minute. what's going on?
CLAW: i don't t don't like this.

SPEAKERPHONE: if in ten seconds you don't tell us where the photos are, you lose a knee, mr. foster. ten more seconds, you lose another. then we go to your wife. 
PHIL: please! you can't do this! we're not lying!
SPEAKERPHONE: one... two... three... four...

SPEAKERPHONE: five... six... seven... eight...
PHIL: 

Ã‚Â€Â¢: everyone looks over. phil's surprised. 
CLARA: but we can't just tell you where they are. we have to take you to them.

FRANK: you drive with her in front. 
PHIL: so what's your plan here?
CLARA: i don't have a plan phil.
PHIL: you don't have a plan?

PHIL: well, if we end up in that car with them we're as good as dead. 
FRANK: quiet!
CLARA: well, any time you want to help...
PHIL: what's that supposed to mean?
FRANK: i said quiet!
CLARA: phil?
PHIL: whoa.
CLARA: phil? what is it?
PHIL: i'm... not feeling so great...
HARRY: 's wrong with him?
PHIL: i didn't... eat dinner and when i don't my blood sugar... hypoglycemic...
CLARA: you're not hypoglycemic.

CLARA: you're diabetic! you never get the terms right, phil! oh no! this is bad, guys. 
PHIL: i just can't... go any further.
HARRY: should we call mr. stockton?
FRANK: don't say his name, you
HARRY: sorry! i was just-
FRANK: we'll just throw him in the back and have her show us.
CLARA: wait! in my purse there's a luna bar. if you give it to me i can find it for him.
CLARA: drop the gun and the keys.
PHIL: oa! clara! no
HARRY: ow! why, man?

PHIL: sorry. i was trying to knock you out. 
HARRY: why,
PHIL: ought that's what you do when-
CLARA: phil! just c'mon!

PHIL: we got to the restaurant late because we hit all this traffic on the highway- 
CL AAA: the shortcut.
PHIL: what?

CLARA: you can tell him. 
PHIL: because you always interrupt me when i try to tell stories, and every time you do it disrupts my flow.
CLARA: fine, you tell it. i won't say another word.
PHIL: fine.
PHIL: see, now i've totally lost where i was.
CLARA AND YOUNG POLICEMAN: you got to the restaurant late-
PHIT: yeah. even using my shortcut which, by the way, was a shortcut - and they gave away our reservation. so we were at the bar and the host was calling out for these other people over and over-
CLARA: which is what they do right before they cancel a reservation anyway.
PHIL: i thought you said you weren't going to interrupt me, clara.
C: i just want him to understand we weren't really "stealing" someone else's

PHIL: do you think he really cares, clara? were just kidnapped, chloroformed and almost shot! i don't think he's going turn around and book us for reservation theft! am i right? 
YOUNG POLIO OFFICER: please. go on.
PHIL: so all of a sudden clara yells out that we're these other people.
YOUNG POLICEMAN: you just took someone else's reservation?

PHIL: yeah. i know! even the guy on the speakerphone couldn't believe it! 
CLARA: you two kinda bonded over that, didn't you?
PHIL: we didn't "bond" over it. i'm just saying, speakerphone guy obviously thought it was weird to do.
YC JG POLICEMAN: guys, you lost we were in the restaurant.
CLARA: ah, you mean the speakerphone guy who's kidnapped and drugged us thinks it's weird to do so it's weird to do?
YOUNG POLICEMAN: guys?
PHIL: oh c'mon! and we found out speakerphone guy's name, phil. it's mr. stockton.

PHIL: wait. so you already know about this guy? you know who he is? 
LIEUTENANT MANNING: how do you do. lieutenant manning.
LIEUTENANT MANNING: nah, as long as they're here might as well get everything from the horse's mouth, right?
LIEUTENANT MANNING: can i get you guys anything to drink? coffee? water? maybe a shot or two of r whiskey?

PHIL: that sounds more like 
LIEUTENANT MANNING: so why don't you tell me all about your incident with mr. stockton.
PHIL: you tell it, clara.
CLARA: oh, don't be like that, phil. please.
LIEUTENANT MANNING: guys... you've obviously been through something traumatic tonight. thankfully it's over and you're both safe and sound. maybe you should cut each other a little bit more of a break.
PHIL: seriously, clara. you tell him.
CJ __: well, we never a. t_::ally "met" stockton.

CLARA: honestly, you wouldn't believe this, but it's because we sat down at the wrong table tonight for dinner. 
CLARA: we pretended to be someone else who didn't show up for their reservations. my idea. and it turned out that these people must have something this mr.

LIEUTENANT MANNING: do you know what? 
CLARA: photos.
LIEUTENANT MANNING: that's all you know?

CLARA: excuse me? 
ENANT MANNING: how were you so sure the gales weren going to show up if you don't know the at all?

LIEUTENANT MANNING: uh huh. i know you don't. it will be contained. right now. 
LIEUTENANT MANNING: where'd they go?

CLARA: we can't just go to another police station, phil! we don't know how big this is! it might not just be manning! 
PHIL: well then we're screwed! who do we go to? the fbi? the cia?
CLARA: they're not going to believe us over a police lieutenant!

PHIL: you've got it, clara. spin it back now!

HOLBROOKE: interesting. i've had some of my guys looking into stockton for years, but nothing ever sticks to him. he's very careful - ties up his loose ends and covers his tracks. but with this... he might have accidentally left himself open.
CLARA: should we be worried about our s
HOLBROOKE: wouldn't be stockton's pattern to risk ing this any larger than it is. where is he?

PHIL: uh... there's already writing all over this.

PHIL: yeah, well, that's a topic for another-
HOLBROOKE: it's just that by now, you and i woulda had a whole brood.
PHIL: that's... charming.

HOLBROOKE: l.o.l,, right? 
UNDERSTAND): it's because you're writing's hard to read, phil, and everyone knows how when doctors write things down-
PHIL: no. yeah. i get it.
HOLBROOKE: we'll have you stay at the bureau for the night. safer for you.
CLARA: thank you so much, holbrooke. i feel like we're in good hands for the e first time tonight.
CLARE: what's wrong?
PHIL: i don't know. maybe i should have had one of holbrooke's eeegerag warn raaaarrrrghereeeeetas.
!NT. CAR - LATER: clam::- olbrooke in the front seat and phil
PHIL: smells like french fries back here,
HOLBROOK': car runs on cooking oil. i just go around to restaurants and recycle their old fry oil.

CLARA: phil's really had enough with this guy. your goodness... where does it end? 
HOLBROOKE: how i roll. now for some reason they wanted us to come in the back entrance.

AGENT: continue slowly down the hallway. sudden movements. are they armed, peterson? 
HOLBROOKE: uh,
PHIL: what the hell's going o
HOLBROOKE: i don't know.

PHIL: well, tell them to stand down. 
HOLBROOKE: uh.. .
PHIL: tell your men to stand down, holbrooke.
AGENT #1: his men?
AGENT #2: what do you want us to do, holbrooke?
AGENT #3: our badass i.t. guy!
CLARA: i. i. guy?
HOLBROOKE: ok... i'm not the "i.t. guy." i help out

AGENT #1: alright, enough. point is, agent peterson scored tonight. when i typed in those socials, an apb shot up with a whole laundry list on these guys. 
PHIL: what?
CLARA: crooked cop did it! it's a lie!
AGENT #1: it's your booking, peterson. we're just here to back you up. holbrooke...
HOLBROOKE: listen guys. i'll just book you and then tomorrow we can straighten the whole-

CLARA: what? oh no you're not! 
AGENT #3: you just gonna take that, peterson?
HOLBROOKE: all right. didn't want to have to-
PHIL: all right! nobody move or he gets it!
AGENT #1: holbrooke has a gun? why does he even ã¢â€â¢ have a gun?
HOLBROOKE: listen, man. i'm not that important. i'm really not. i'm not the it guy but i'm just one step above him! no reason to do something rash, all right?
AGENT #3: you think it's even loaded?
A` -.: i don't.
HOLBROOKE: loaded, guys! it's loaded!
PHIL: i'm not around!
HOLBROOKE: he's not around! he's not around!

PHIL: keycard. 
HOLBROOKE: what?
A FEW FBI AGENTS: he wants your keycard.
PHIL: thanks. he and i, the communication isn't great...

HOLBROOKE: seriously, phil. i'm a bad shield. i promise. 
CLARA: wow, phil!
PHIL: just give me your car keys, holbrooke. when we're about to drive off we'll let you go.
HOLBROOKE: uh, they were on the keychain.
PHIL: what? holb'?n`_ the key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard inside. the keys were on that.
PHIL: 
CL AA: we'll never outrun them.

PHIL: yow! man is that loud! 
PHIL: how are you so good at that?
CLARA: gotta get going! quick!
PHIL: where?
HOLBROOKE: across the bridge a few blocks down that street there's an entrance to the green line subway. get on it and you can get anywhere in this city. phil and clara look at him, confused.
PHIL: aren't you supposed to be our hostage?
HOLBROOKE: whatever. i don't know. sure. what's the difference? i'm never gonna get behind that desk now anyway. my gun! i dropped it in front of everybody!
PHIL: it wasn't so much of a drop. it was more of a... bobble.
CLARA: yeah, a bobble's bad...

HOLBROOKE: listen, if you just leave me here i can tell them you ran the other way. it'll buy you time to get there. and maybe i can work on clearing all this up for you. 
CLARA: what?
PHIL: let me have the gun.
PHIL: here. tell them you got it back from us. holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.
HOLBROOKE: thanks, phil.

PHIL: it's just on the other side of that bridge. i think we're going to make it. 
PHIL (COND: what?
CLARA: nothing. that was just nice of you, back there.
CLARA: this is crazy, but you know what i'm, reminded of right now?
PHIL: bourne identity?

CLARA: i'm talking about right now. when we used to walk home late at night after going downtown to the clubs. we couldn't ever find a cab, remember? we'd grab those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at the weiner's circle and go to the adler planetarium to watch the sunrise. 
PHIL: where i held your hand for the first time.
CLARA: i can't believe we used to stay up all night like that.
PHIL: it's because we could sleep 'til noon.
CLARA: if i remember correctly, we weren't always "sleeping."
PHIL: i just don't understand when we got so... i don't know...
CLARA: old.
PHIL: no, i was thinking numb. when did we become one of those couples that we used to look at in restaurants back then and think were so sad?
CLARA: we're not that bad, phil. i just think we haven't been that honest with each other recently. phil doesn't understa
CLARA: not big things. just little things keep adding up and putting this thing between us.
CLARA: like the fact i know you never want to talk about us having this other baby.

PHIL: it's not that i don't want another kid, clara. it's just... i used to be the whole pie with you. and now with ollie and your work, i'm barely even a piece of the pie anymore. i'm, like, maybe a pecan on a piece of the pie! so part of me's not jumping at the chance of having the little pecan i have left of your attention going into some new baby's mouth! 
CLARA: but that's crazy, phil. when you're home you're the one who seems like your hardly even there! it's all about your work. believe me, if you-
CLARA: 
PHIL: i think we're ok. just play cool and keep walking.
PHIL: now you can say
PHIL: e 's only a few feet.
CLARA: what u high? no way.

CLARA (CONT'D: ahhh! are you crazy!?! 
PHIL: let go, clara!

PHIL: go or i'm going to tickle you! 
CLARA: no you're not, phil. we have a rule! tickling. i'm not-

PHIL: ow! i think i broke my 
CLARA: ow! ow! dammit, phil! what's our rule about tickling?
PHIL: i'm sorry! i didn't do it for pleasure!

PHIL: "it's only funny if it's funny for the both of us." 
CLARA: right! and guess what? it wasn't funny for me, phil!
CLARA: b i g mistake!

PHIL: t ' s your elbow? 
CL RA: 's ok, how`s your butt?
PHIL: well, for jumping off a bridge onto a moving boat, not so bad.
PHIL: i can't even believe this is happening to us.
CLARA: you know, we're kind of running ou ons.
PHIL: maybe we could just hide or something until this all blows over.
CLARA: what makes you think it ever wil
PHIL: iaybe we should just turn ourselves

CLARA: imagine what it's going to be like for ollie when everyone hears about this tomorrow. i bet our pictures are going to be all over the papers. 
PHIL: wait. what if we found the pictures?
CLARA: what do you mean?
PHIL: these pictures that everyone's after. we could get them we'd have some kind o bargaining chip to get out of this.
CLARA: but then we'd have to find the gales.
PHIL: except... the rainbow.
CLARA: the pictures have something to do with that place!
PHIL: yeah, but even so, holbrooke said these clubs are so secret you have to know where they are and how to get in-
CLARA: what?
PHIL: you're not listening to me again!
CLARA: "you have to know where they are and h to get in-"
PHIL: that's great. clara wanna cracker?

C LARA: i'm calling because of what you said, phil. i know who can help us. 
CLARA_: hey jane, it's clara.
CLARA_: where am i? i'm... i'm on a party cruise around chicago. oh yeah. it is turning into quite a night. listen, we need to go to this club called the rainbow later. do you know how we can get in? clara looks at phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her ear and listens. phil watches her until he notices the boat is turning. he looks around the side.
PHIL: ara...
CLARA: oh shoot. you know what jane? i've actually gotta jump off right now.

LIEUTENANT MANNING: check again. 
PARTIER: hey! that's mine, man!
LIEUTENANT MANNING: evidence. the partier mumbles "asshole" as he stumbles manning si i.s and looks out over the wa

CLARA: mine's totally shot too. 
PHIL: you got the info from her though, right?
CLARA: yeah, but we can't get in looking like this, phil.
PHIL: i don't think we have a choice. not a big shopping hour.
PHIL: now if we wanted to do a little cardio, on the other hand. who knew that many people worked out at 1 in the morning?
PHIL: you wanna do a little cardio?
PHIL: ok, now that's scary. you know you're starting to think like a real criminal? you know that, don't you?

PHIL: down here? 
JANE: it's what she said.
PHIL: and if you die, does jane get your commissic-l on the open house?
CLARA: excuse me?

CLARA: um... do you know which is the way back to kansas? 
SHADY GUY #1: welcome to the rainbow.

VOICE: if you wanner be at anyone about it, be at stockton... 
BALDING MAN: you know, rumor is he's behind the whole mess. raking it in on both ends. what do you mean?
BALDING MAN: hush hush shell companies he owns. one of them hires all the construction inspectors. another he's got rents all the construction equipment. the more one slows things down with violations, more the other takes to the bank.

BALDING MAN: my guess is he's trying to screw up mayor diggs' reelection. imagine what someone like him could do if he got someone less "squeaky clean" in the mansion. 
PHIL: you! gale, right?
BALDING MAN: what?
PHIL: sorry. from the side... confused you with somebody else.

BA --Y_-_.: really get s,-.y names. 
CLARA: thanks any-way.

CLARA: excuse me. does she work here? 
WAITRESS: dora? i guess she still does. hasn't been showing up lately, though.
CLARA: do you know where i can find her?
WAITRESS: you could try back tomorrow, see if she-
C: i need to find her tonight.
WAITRESS: did you try ray's place?
CLARA: ray?
WAITRESS: that sleazebag boyfriend of hers. he's got that place a few blocks from here where he used to throw those after work parties.
CLARA: do you remember where it is?
ANOTHER PART OF THE RAINBOW: phil scans the crowds, back and forth.
MALE VOICE: phil!

PHIL: hit. 
MR. RIVERS: this is a surprise! what are you doing down here?
PHIL: uh... well, same thing as you guys, i would guess. working those "extra hours," right?
CLARA: phil!
CLARA: phil, we gotta go. i found out where-

GEORGE: and i'm george. 
CLARK: sorry, but i've got to steal him. we've gotta be somewhere else right now.
MR. RIVERS: at 2 in the morning? where are you guys headed?
PHIL: i'm sorry, mr. rivers. we really can talk about it.
MR. RIVERS: phil foster with places to go he can talk about at 2 in the morning.

PHIL: that never really- opens. she shoots phil a look. 
PHIL: ok. never mind.

CLARA: are you bent over like that? 
PI: sneaking.

CL: ok. fine. i was just asking. 
RAY: talk! who are you?
PHIL: you know, that's like the 5th gun i've had to my head tonight! just lower that thing and cool it, ok?
DORA: she was in the bathroom at the restaurant!
RAY: who are you?
PHIL: who are we? good question! well, everybody thinks we're "the gales" because we were lucky enough to take your reservation tonight!
RAY: what? why would you take our reservation?
CLARE: don't.
RAY: both of you. stand ov there in the corner. dammit dora, ere's your brother? he was e,.--,-dc.-zed to b here an hour ago! i don't know, ra_, he's not answering his phone.
RAY: yeah, well, if these guys found u long do you think it's gonna take other guys? we're dead! dead!

CLARA: excuse me. 
CLARA: sorry. i have to pee.
RAY: you have to nee?
PHIL: that's my wife.

DORA: you must just think i'm awful. 
CLARA: i don't think anything about you. i just want this to be over.
DORA: ray saw mr. stockton making all this money blackmailing people at the club. when he found out who was interested in me... he said it would be so easy. we'd never have to work again.

RAY E: stockton's pictures? you.think they're stockton's pictures? 
RAY E: you really have no idea what you've gotten into, do you?

PHIL: i'm ok! i'm ok! 
RAY: hey! get-
RAY: ahh!
Ã‚Â€Â¢: phil crabs along even faster.

CLARA: oh are you hit? 
PHIL: no... just... a little ... winded... that... crawling's... tough... on the core...

FRANK:  
FRANK: you stay put.

CHUBBY GUY: hey? which is 357 maple street? 
PHIL: you're dora's brother?
CHUBBY GUY: who are you?
PHIL: you're late!
CHUBBY GUY: ok sorry! the roads are all screwed with all this construction-
CHUBBY GUY: hey!

CLARA: phil! careful! 
CLARA: please, phil! it's not going to do any good if you-
BLACK DUDE: no no no. tell me you did not just do that.
PHIL: 
BLACK DUDE: oh, man! you did not just do that!
PHIL: owe you one.

BLACK DUDE: oh no no no. you're gonna get outta this car and hand me over a license and some insurance. we gonna do this right. man, i think i got whiplash and 
PHIL: 
BLACK DUDE: hey! hey! what do you think you're doing?

PHIL: i'm not yelling! i'm just talking in an very animated voice! 
PHIL: ok, now when i say so, spin your wheel!

CLARA: what? you just said spin the wheel, phil! you didn't say which way. 
PHIL: yes i did!
CLARA: no you didn't!
BLACK DUDE: she's right! you di
CLARA: thank you! can we take him home? i need him!
BLACK DUD: aw man!
PHIL: i say our best chance is to reverse again, then use both engines to floor as fast as we can all the way down michigan.
CLARA: why stay on michigan?
PHIL: why stay on michigan? because it's a wider street.
LARA: it's also a busier street! i think it would be better to try to branch off.
PHIL: why do you have a problem with every route i take?

PHIL: clara! reverse it, keep it straight put your foot to the floor. give it everything! 
BLACK: oooh. i really woulc_n.'t be doing that.
CLARA: doing what? what are you doing?!?
CL.: oh

BLACK DUDE: ha ha! that last move was wicked, man. wicked. 
PHIL: ã¢â€â¢ sorry.
BLACK DUDE: s cool.
CLARA: they're back.
BLACK DUDE: what the are you guys in trouble for?

PHIL: i'm not blaming you. please? 
PHIL: now whatever direction i give you, take your normal version of it and tone it down like 85 percent, ok?
CLARA: 35 percent. fine.
PHIL: ok. small left. now!

PHIL: yes! that was awesome! perfect, clara! now give me a medium right. do it! 
CLAA: yes!
BLACK DUDE: now we're cooking with fire!

PHIL: yes! no. 
BLACK DUDE: oh no.
CLARA: what?
BLACK DUDE: say we can pop you guys up and over.

BLACK DUDE: you climb over, then we both reverse it and leadfoot the motherfuckers. send you flying over the top. 
CLARA: what?
CLARA: phil, don't even think of it.
PHIL: can do it. clara.
CLARA: no, phil. we can't! it's suicide!
BLACK DUDE: here we go now... one... two... three!

CLARA: i want to make sure that at least one our son's parents survives tonight! 
PHIL: what?

CLARA: you almost just got us killed! 
PHIL: i see. i almost got us killed. forget about the people chasing and shooting at us all night long because of the reservation you stole.
CLARA: there's a difference between fleeing from people shooting at you and knowingly driving a car in reverse over an open drawbridge!
PHIL: unbelievable! you know, all you complain about is that i don't take risks anymore. then the second i do, you get mad at me for doing it! i can't win with you!
CLARA: poor phil! you have i so bad, don't you!
PHIL: oh, you have no idea! every single day from the moment we wake up you're bossy, ã¢â€â¢ disapproving, inconsiderate-
CLARA: i'm inconsiderate? i'm inconsiderate?!? have you ever seen our bathroom in the morning after tsunami phil's blown through? the floor! the sink! you use my toothbrush.
PHIL: what's the difference? afraid you're gonna get my cooties?
CLARA: i want my own toothbrush, phil! sue me! and how many years have i asked you to do a simple thing like put the toilet paper in right?
PHIL: listen to yourself! you have problems with how i pqt in the toilet paper!
C: because under makes no sense, phil! under makes no sense! when it's under it doesn't pull off right! it just keeps spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade properly!

CLARA: after ten years of asking you to have roll the right way, you still can't do it! 
PHIL: yeah, how about the fact that i have not woken up with our comforter over me once in those 10 nears! you steal the whole thing away from me every night and mummify yourself.
CLARA: what? phil, i do not "steal" the comforter. it just happens when we're-
PHIL: bulls bull-shit.
CLARA: don't you point that at me!
PHIL: i see your hock leg lock maneuver. don't think i don't!
PHIL: you wrap that leg around and lock the comforter down then reeeeel it in so i can't pull it at all.

CLARA: i do not leg lock the comforter! 
PHIL: oh yes you do!
CLARA: u think i don't know your little icks? where you leave like half a thimble of milk in the carton and put it back in the fridge so you don't have to be the one to "finish" it and replace it?
PHIL: you're right. i do that. you know why do that, clara?
CLARA: because you don't want to haul your to the market to buy it yourself!
PHIL: because i'm afraid to! forbid i the wrong kind of grass-fed bio homogenized whatever and meet your wrath!

PHIL: how would you even know? you don't give me or anyone else a chance! you're so controlling! you've got to be wonder woman, keeping everyone in line, looking down on them from her fancy wonder woman plane and controlling everything with all her wonder superpowers! you paint yourself as this victim but you get off on being the superlady! 
CLARA: urgh! you know w sometimes i don't pay attention to you, phil? because you give me a headache!
PHIL: what? no aspirin in the wonderpurse? how could it be?
CLARA: screw you, phil!
PHIL: yeah, fine! sure! screw me ! even if i survive tonight i'm screwed all around anyway! screwed with you! screwed with my job!
CLARA: what are you talking about, screwed with your job?

PHIL: was supposed to spend all tonight guring out a new brilliant plan for the fund so george wouldn't take it over tomorrow. doesn't look like that's gonna happen! 
CLARA: why didn't you tell me?
PHIL: i don't know, clara. maybe because i didn't want you chiming in on how mr. rivers was right. he wants the new guy for all the reasons you complain about me! someone who doesn't "play it safe." someone who'll "take a risk."
CLARA: i can't believe that's what you think do.
PHI: yeah, well...
PHI: you know, when you set up this whole "magical" night, in that dress... i got this glimmer that it was going to be like it used to be with us. but... i don't know. i guess we're just not those people anymore.
CLARA: i guess we're not.

CLARA: this... this... this... 
PHIL: what?
CLARA: side cramp... wow.
PHIL: what is it?
PHIL: oh jeez. it's... it's...
C: it's the mayor.
PHIL: i bet this didn't have anything to do with stockton at first.

PHIL: the mayor must have gone to stockton's club one night. he saw dora working there and obviously gave some sign that he was interested. 
CLARA: so much for "mr. squeaky clea
PHIL: her sleazy boyfriend ray finds out and convinces her to take him up on it so they could photograph it and blackmail him.
CLARA: they knew it was an election year and he would have to pay them whatever they asked.

PHIL: but somehow stockton found out about the photos too and wanted that power over the mayor himself. 
CLARA: so he sent his guys to the restaurant to intercept the gales and get the photos.
PHIL: but ray and dora spotted them and bailed before the mayor even had a chance to show up. phil thinks. he snaps his fingers.
CLARA: what?
PHIL: if we could find some way to get in touch with the mayor directly, without anyone else knowing, there actually might be a way out of this for us.
CLARA: can.
DOORMAN BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT: phil and clara walk into the lobby of the doorman

DOORMAN: whoa whoa whoa. where do you you're going? 
CLARA: oh, we're guests of apartment 605
DOORMAN: and you are?
CLARA: are you crazy? it's 4 in the morning!

DOORMAN: i'm not really allowed to just let you up there. 
CLARA: please. just look at us!
DOORMAN: ok. yeah. go ahead. the elevator door opens and they get inside.
PHIL: have a nice night.
DOORMAN: you too.

PHIL: i can't find any rope. only yarn. 
CLARA: yarn? fine. just use that. i'll start looking.
MRS. CARDIGAN: you two weren't very prepared.
PHIL: excuse me?

E: you should have been more prepared. thought ahead and brought the rope you. 
PHIL: ok, why don't you lay off the critiqu
MRS. CARD---'--': 's not a critique. it's a fact.
PHIL: oh is it a fact?
MRS. CARDIGA?: yes. ng word choice.
PHIL: wrong word choice? unbelievable! well, let me throw a little word choice "correction" your way.
CLARA: partner!
PHIL: five year old kids can't be "antagonistic."

CLARA: if you're done tying her up, come over and help. 
MRS. CARDIGAN: the name's cardigan, not rockefeller, if you haven't figured it out yet! what idiots!
PHIL: you must be such a positive influence on our youth.
MRS. CARDIGAN: you're one to talk!
CLARA: partner!
CLARA: 1ã¯â¿â½1 listen, lady, just sit tight and we'll be out of here before you know it.
CLARA: got it!
CLARA: what?
CLARA: oliver told her he's being mean to je y briggs because... he says he wants to marry her?
PHIL: and that's what married people do.

MRS. CARDIGAN: what's wrong over there? no "crown jewels" yet? 
CLARA: let's make the call,

PHIL: lucy? who's lucy? 
MRS. CARDIGAN: i'm lucy.
MRS. CARDIGAN: you're calling our mayor in the middle of the night?
MRS. CARDIGAN: i had nothing to do with this charlie!
CLARA: charlie?!? lucy!?!? _ appened to "ã‚â°boundaries matter?ã¢â€âž =_.h? what happened to that,
PHIL: hey "partner." how about you put a sock in it now.
MAYOR DIGGS: who is this ? r1

PHIL: you don't know me, mr. mayor, but i've recently come into possession of something that you were supposed to get from the gales tonight. 
PHIL: hello?
MAYOR DIGGS: and?
PHIL: and whether you realize it or not, we ended up doing you a favor. you see, this man named mr. stockton - i know if you know him-
MAYOR DIGGS (PH(: i know who he is.
PHIL: well, he tried to steal the photos from the gales. he's even got cops on his payroll helping him out. we think he was planning to sabotage your re-election.
MAYOR DIGGS: so what do you want for them?
PHIL: what do we want?
PHIL: we just want our lives back. we want to go home, mr. mayor.

MAYOR DIGGS E: if you really can get me... what i was supposed to receive earlier without this getting out, i promise you i'll take care of your safety. 
PHIL: but now the police think that-
MAYOR DIGGS: trust me. get me the photos and he won't be bothering you again.
CLARA: is it?

PHIL: uh... yeah. we'll meet you at the adler planetarium in 1 hour. come alone. e 
MAYOR DIGGS: of course. and... thank you.

MR. STOCKTON: st keeps getting better. 
ADLER PLANETARIUM - LATER: phil and clara sit silently on the steps of the
CLARA: man, i love this city. always have.
PHIL: when was the last time we watched the sunrise together?
CLARA: probably the last time we were here.
PHIL: nope. it wasn't. it was the morning that ollie was born.

CLARA: man, i'm starving! 
PHIL: me too.
PHIL: sorry you never got your truffles.

E: clara reaches into her purse. 
CLARA: who needs white truffles when you've got a lemon zest luna bar.
CLARA: what?
PHIL: ok, what happened to us tonight? the are we doing here?
CLAIRA: it's not funny.
PHIL: no, i know it's not funny. it's not funny at all.
CLARA: en why are you laughing?
PHIL: why are you laughing?

I: wha e gonna be ok, cla 
CLP--P, A: no. it's not that. just... this is nice. right now. you don't understand... i really don't want to be wonder woman, phil! i don't at all!
CLP--P, A: you don't see that this whole time i'm flying in a glass plane! in a glass mane!
PHIL: uh, ok, but i think wonder woman actua flies an invisible plane, not a glass plane.

CLARA: you see! it isn't even there at all! i don't even have a plane! no plane! i'm running on fumes! 
PHIL: you're not running on fumes, clara.
CLARA: i'm not trying to be uptight, or controlling! or a nutrition...
PHIL: nazi.
CLARA: nazi! i'm just trying the only way i know how to keep everything from fall apart!
PHIL: it won't fall apart. and i really can help whenever you feel like it is. with ollie. whatever. you just never act like you need me to.
CLARA: that's because as it is you see us as a distraction from your work!
PHIL: you think i see you guys as a distraction? no, clara.
PHIL: you don't understand... i have this wife who does everything better than anyone i've ever known. and the greatest son. you want to know why i obsess so much about my stupid job? because i want to feel like... like i can do something good enough to deserve someone like you. i mean, i look at you and i jest don't stack up.
CLARA: that's crazy, phil. you do. you're a man. you're the best man i know.
PHIL: i'll never be the guy who remembers always put toilet paper on the right way.

CLARA: i don't think i would really want to be with that guy, phil. i just... want us to be on the same team again. 
PHIL: listen, you know what i said before, about not being the people we used to be?
CLARA: phil, we were angry-
PHIL: no, clara. it's true. we're not. and i know i'm going to drive you crazy again, and you're definitely going to drive me crazy. but i wouldn't want to do it with anybody else.
PHIL: we had a good fight tonight, didn't we?
CLARA: yeah, we did. you know the worst part about not talking about all this recently?
PHIL: what?
CLARA: we missed out on a lot of make up sex.
PHIL: you think?
CLARA: oh yeah. phil s when he spots something behind clara. mayor diggs looks both walks from his car in the parking lot toward the--.
PHIL: here we go.
PHIL: tell me now. do you need to pee?
CLARA: 1 hold it.

PHIL: this is what you're looking for. i've tten down our information inside. 
MAYOR DIGGS: and that's it?
PHIL: that's it. we're going home now.
PHIL: oh run, clara!
LIEUTENANT MANNING: the next one won't be a warning shot.
MAYOR DIGGS: i'm going to wait in the c r don't mind.
MR. STOCKTON: sure thing, mr. mayor.

PHIL: please. please don't do 
LIEUTENANT MANNING: over there.
PHIL: please! we have a child!
'VT MINING: said over there!

PHIL: -eally were planning to give you the pictures, mr. mayor. that is, until you -.sre so casual about is not needing to worry about the cop who was after us. that made me a little suspicious because i never told you which cop it was. 
CLARA: then we got to talking and realized how we were.

CLARA: e if you came on to some waitress at the rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn comfortable there. 
PHIL: which meant stockton was probably your buddy.
MR. STOCKTON: where are the pictures?
PHIL: but we were still confused, because if you guys are buddies, how do you explain the falconwood corporation?
MR. STOCKTON: they're obviously not going to tell us!
MAYOR DIGGS: wait. i've heard that name. what's the falconwood corporation?
PHIL: runs the hiring of inspectors for the department of highways in chicago. you

MR. STOCKTON: manning! i said shoot them! 
LIEUTENANT MANNING: i work for the mayor, terrence.
MAYOR DIGGS: why do you keep interrupting, terrence?
PHIL: maybe because according to the paperwork you've got there, he owns falconwood.
CLARA: not only that, you'll see those other pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called eurostruct - which rents the city all of its construction equipment.
MR. STOCKTON: frank, harry!

PHIL: the more violations falconwood finds, the longer eurostruct rents the equipment. that turns into big bucks, mr. mayor. i'm sure that's not a moral problem for you, but he's kind of you in an election year, isn't he? some of us are pretty off about the roads. 
MAYOR DIGGS: you did this to me? i don't get it, terrence. why? how much do you need? i have the lieutenant here watch your back on all of your gambling clubs-
MR. STOCKTON: oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble at? where i cover your debts? those clubs?
MAYOR DIGGS: i slipped your company 5 no-bid foreclosed buildings for a dollar each downtown.
MR. STOCKTON Ã¢Â€Â¢: you think that pays for what i do for you? the girls i have to pay off? the jet charters? and let's not even get into your "re-election fund"! let's not even go there!
PHIL: listen to them.
MR. STOCKTON: how did you get this? how?
HOLBROOKE: tha be from me.

HOLEROOK E: fbi! drop it! 
104.: manning tried to object, pulling out his bad
HOLBROOKE: yeah, yeah. i know all about you, buddy.
MAYOR DIGGS: aw
PHIL: makes you feel any better, i wasn't gonna vote for you anyway.
CLARA: either.

Ã‚Â€Â¢ CLARA: everything ok? 
HOLBROOKE: yeah. they just need me downtown in half an hour for a news conference with the deputy mayor. want it for the morning shows.
PHIL: don't think they're going to be calling you the it guy any-more.
HOLBROOKE: listen guys, i feel weird about not even acknowledging you two.
CLARA: don't.
HOLBROOKE: but you should be up there with me. you handed this whole case to me.
PHIL: yeah, well-, that's how we roll.

CHAZ: hey hey! up bright and early, aren 
PHIL: yep. we sure are.
