FRANK: little denise, i say this: i mark it up and i write it down and you've been warned: "by the end of may, you will know i'm not gay." "on the fourth of june, denise, you're gonna be lickin' my spoon." "and come august, you my big fat sausage." i've set goals for myself. and what? i've said "enough is enough." because why? she's not gonna be your pal. she's not gonna be your friend. you think she's gonna be there for you the second you need something? think again - this denise! but: listen up: that is not to say that we don't all need women as friends, 'cause we're gonna learn later on in chapter 23 that having a couple of chick-friends laying around can come in real handy in setting jealousy traps. but we'll get to that. number one
FRANK: create a crisis -- simple and clean, and if done properly can be quite effective in getting some bush. here we go: set a date with your so-called "friend." let's say you make it 7:30.

FRANK: you wait until about nine o'clock and you ring the doorbell. 
FRANK: she opens it up, as hell, but finds you sobbing your eyes out -- frank looks up at her and says:
FRANK: ...i can't believe what happened...
FRANK: you explain between sobs that you hit a dog on the way over to pick her up and you had to rush it to the animal hospital but by the time you got there --
FRANK: ...and it's paw was sticking out... and it was too late. it was too late.
GIRL: ohhh, shhhh...shhh...frank...

GIRL: hey, frank. it's cindy. i'm wondering if you wanna grab a bite and see a movie?

PHIL: well can you connect me to someone else?
CHAD: well what's the situation?
PHIL: well, ok. lemme see how i explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go: i'm, my name is phil parma and i work for a man named earl partridge -- mr. earl partidge. i'm his nurse. he's a very sick man. he's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- hello? are you there, hello?

YOUNG PHARMACY KID: you been on prozac long? dexadrine?
LINDA: ...i don't....
YOUNG PHARAMCY KID: interesting drugs. dexadrine's basically speed in a pill. y'know? but i guess a lot of doctors are balancing out the prozac with the dexadrine, eh? that liquid morphine'll knock you down, out, around, up and down someone's not careful.....can't mix those up, y'know... ...must have a lot goin' on in your life for all that stuff there.
YOUNG PHARAMCY KID: strong, strong stuff here, boy...wow....
LINDA: you motherfucker...you motherfucker....

OLDER PHARMACIST: please, lady, why don't you just calm down -- 
LINDA: and you too. don't you call me "lady." i come in with these things, i give it over to you, you doubt, you make your phone calls, check on me, look suspicious, ask questions, "i'm sick." i have sickness

PHIL: i know -- and i can't really explain that, but i have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore -- 
CHAD: uh-huh.
PHIL: does this sound weird?
CHAD: well i'm not sure why you're calling me.
PHIL: there's no number for frank in any of earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- i mean, like i said, he's dying, y'know. dying of cancer.
CHAD: what kind of cancer?
PHIL: brain and lung.
CHAD: my mother had breast cancer.
PHIL: it's rough. i'm sorry, did she make it?
CHAD: oh, she's fine.
PHIL: oh that's good.
CHAD: it was scary though.
PHIL: it's a helluva disease.
CHAD: sure is. so why call me?
PHIL: i know this all seems silly. i know that maybe i sound ridiculous, like maybe this is the scene of the movie where the guy is trying to get ahold of the long-lost son, but this is that scene. y'know? i think they have those scenes in movies because they're true, because they really happen. and you gotta believe me: this is really happening. i mean, i can give you my phone number and you can call me back if you wanna check with whoever you can check this with, but don't leave me hanging on this -- please -- please. see: see: see this is the scene of the movie where you help me out --

FRANK: like i said, yeah -- 
GWEN: and you went to van nuys high, right?
FRANK: i don't how much i went -- but i was
FRANK: what name? my name?
GWEN: it's not your given name, right?
FRANK: my mother's name, actually. good question. you've done you're research.
GWEN: and "frank?"
FRANK: "frank" was my mother's father.
GWEN: ok. that's why. i had trouble locating your school records at berkely and ucla. your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
FRANK: oh, yeah. no, no, no. they wouldn't --
GWEN: they wouldn't?
FRANK: no, no, no. certainly not. i wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right.
GWEN: kind of.
FRANK: i wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: my enrollment was totally unoffical because i was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there. but there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: macready, horn and langtree among others. i was completely independent financially, and like i said: one sad sack a so what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think that's what most people respond to in "seduce," and at the end of the day? hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your in it -- it's about finding what you can be in this world. defining it. controling it and saying: i will take what is mine. you just happen

JIMMY GATOR: hello! musical bonus question before we go to break and the lucky team is -- jimmy opens an envelope and reads: 
JIMMY GATOR: kids in the lead and they get a chance to pull further and farther ahead -- with the following secret bonus musical question: i will read you a line from an opera and you are to give me the same line in the language in which the opera was originaly written and for a bonus 25 you can sing it. here's the line:

CLAUDIA: yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit -- 
JIM KURRING: i like iced coffee, generally, but a day
CLAUDIA: -- do you wanna cup?
JIM KURRING: that's great, thank you. she starts heating/preparing him some coffee.
CLAUDIA: i don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
JIM KURRING: oh, it'll be fine, i'm sure, claudia.
CLAUDIA: you take cream or sugar?
JIM KURRING: that'd be fine. so, claudia, lemme just say, so i can get my role of lapd officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee i'm not gonna write you up or anything, i'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud: they're incovenienced by that. if you had a job you'd probably understand, but i see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- if it's the middle of the day -- that's what i do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? i see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
CLAUDIA: yeah.
JIM KURRING: arlight, then. cheers.
JIM KURRING: is this boyfriend bothering you?
CLAUDIA: i don't have a boyfriend.
JIM KURRING: the gentleman who came to the door --
CLAUDIA: -- is not my boyfriend.
JIM KURRING: many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but i have to tell you that, being a police officer, i've seen it happen: young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, i'm gettin' a call on the radio, i got a 422 --
CLAUDIA: it's not -- what's a 422?
JIM KURRING: it's where situations like these lead, claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help. now there are certain measures you can take --
CLAUDIA: it's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over. really.
JIM KURRING: i don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
CLAUDIA: you won't. you won't have to.
JIM KURRING: but i wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
CLAUDIA: i'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
JIM KURRING: okey-doke.

MARY: are you alright? 
JIMMY: i think i'm gonna throw up, i think. i haven't thrown up since i was twenty years old. jimmy stumbles over to a corner a bit;

CYNTHIA: stanley, what's the problem? 
STANLEY: i have to go to the bathroom, cynthia.
CYNTHIA: christ, stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now. you have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is not the time to go to the bathroom.

JANET: hello, phil.
PHIL: hi, hi, thank you for taking my call --

DONNIE: what? what does that mean?

THURSTON: brad, dear?
THURSTON: who was it that said: "a man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
DONNIE: -- samuel johnson.
BRAD: i don't know.
THURSTON: it was the lovely samuel johnson who also spoke of a fella "who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
DONNIE: "the" cause of dullness in others --
THURSTON: picky, picky.
DONNIE: -- and lemme tell you this: samuel johnson never had his life on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money? his parents? his mommy and daddy? make him live this life like this -- "a man of genius" gets on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? it hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and
PATRON #1: you're parents took your money you won on that game show?
DONNIE: yes they did. what does that mean, "spoke in the wheel?"
THURSTON: things go round 'n round, don't they?
DONNIE: yes they do, they do, but i'll make my dreams come true, you see? i will.
THURSTON: this sounds sad as a weeping willow.
DONNIE: i used to be smart but now i'm just stupid.
THURSTON: shall we drink to that?
DONNIE: "if a brick weighs one pound plus one
THURSTON: "why don't you shut the up," is me to you, chapter right here, verse right now.

GWENOVIER: it's fine. i can bleep it out.
FRANK: i warned you -- i get on a roll...
GWENOVIER: -- let's talk more about your background --
FRANK: muffy -- coffee?
GWENOVIER: i'm confused about your past is the thing.
FRANK: is that still lingering?
GWENOVIER: -- just to clarify --
FRANK: so boring, so useless --
GWENOVIER: i would just want to clear some things up:
FRANK: thank you, muffy. funny thing is: this is an important element of, "seduce and destory:" "facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something i tell my men over and over --
GWENOVIER: this isn't meant --
FRANK: -- and i try and teach the students to ask: what is it in aid of?
GWENOVIER: are you asking me that?
FRANK: yes.
GWENOVIER: well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
FRANK: in aid of what?
GWENOVIER: i'm saying, frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
FRANK: -- there's a lot more important things i'd like to put myself
FRANK: not really.
GWENOVIER: it's not like i'm trying to attack you --
FRANK: this is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "the most useless thing in the world
GWENOVIER: we talked earlier about your mother.
FRANK: i'm not sure i hear a question in there?
GWENOVIER: do you remember a miss simms?

GWENOVIER: she does. from when you were a boy. 
FRANK: mm. hm.
GWENOVIER: she lived in tarzana.
FRANK: an old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, i figured this was coming sooner
GWENOVIER: no, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
FRANK: go ahead and waste your time.
GWENOVIER: i was told that your mother died. that your mother died when you were young --
FRANK: and that's what you've heard?
GWENOVIER: i talked to miss simms. miss simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
GWENOVIER: in my research i have you listed as
VIDEO CAMERA POV - THAT MOMENT: frank lights his cigarette. camera zooms into cu.
FRANK: are you asking me a question?
GWEN: well i guess the question is this: do you remember miss simms?

TODD: well, jimmy, i know this, i have perfect pitch, you see -- and that would be a-d-e. and that would represent lemonade. 
JIMMY: for 250. next notes, please: oc musical notes: e-g-g. todd got it. that's e-g-g which would be ~egg."
JIMMY: for 500 and the third set of notes: oc musical notes: b-e-e. todd b-e-e -- and don't get stung.

LINDA: no...i just... i'm so up here alan, i don't know...there's so much...so many things -- 
KLIGMAN: are you on drugs right now?
LINDA: if i talk to you...y'know...if i tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? you can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? attornery-client, you understand?
KLIGMAN: not exactly, linda. i'm not sure where you're going with this --
LINDA: like a shrink, like if i go to see a shrink, i'm protected, i can say
KLIGMAN: linda, you're safe. ok. it's alright.
LINDA: -- i have something to tell you. i have to tell you something. i want to change his will, can i change his will?...i need to ---
KLIGMAN: you can't change his will. only earl can change his will.
LINDA: no, no....no, you see...i never loved him. i never loved him, earl. when i started, when i met him, i met him and i him and i married him because i wanted his money, do you understand? i'm telling you this now...this i've never told anyone...i didn't love him. and now....i know i'm in that will, i know, i was there with him, we were all there together when we made that thing and all the money i'ii get -- i don't want it -- because i love him so much now...i've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and i look at him and he's about to go, alan, he's dead...he's moments... i took care of him through this, alan. and what now then?

VOICE: "hello, mary. how are you and the seven kids? as you probably heard by know, we sure gave that pope a run for his money --" the ~adults" buzz. jimmy looks to mim. 
MIM: well: that would be general robert e. lee. his wife mary park custiss. and he did have seven children and he would be talking about pope, who he defeated at the battle of monasses --

MIM: well that would be napoleon speaking to josephine. 
JIMMY: that's right!

KLIGMAN: what kind of medication are you on right now, linda that's -- 
LINDA: this is not any medication
KLIGMAN: adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- linda. linda. calm down.
LINDA: i can't.
KLIGMAN: you don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
LINDA: where will the money go?
KLIGMAN: well. considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy,
LINDA: what does that mean?
