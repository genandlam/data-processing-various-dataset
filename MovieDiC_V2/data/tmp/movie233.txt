speaker1: what a mess! 
speaker2: i told you!
speaker2: i can't breathe.
speaker1: use your mask, dummy.
speaker2: "volga boat..., man." whoomph!

speaker1: sam, look, there's a whole eight feet up there. 
speaker2: and about eighty years of dust.
speaker1: we have all this height, sam. we could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. that would leave all this space.
speaker2: for what?
speaker1: for space. just space.
speaker2: be great for bumper cars.
speaker3: sam, this may be none of my business, but i'm concerned you're doing too much coke.
speaker1: hey, sam, turn around.
speaker3: how 'bout me?
speaker3: i'll never wash again.

speaker1: all together now. one, two, three. 
speaker2: hey, look what i found. there's a penny inside. for luck in our new loft. it's a good omen.
speaker1: you're the good omen.
speaker1: it's gorgeous.
speaker3: you guys lucked out. hell, i bet you could sell it tomorrow and double your investment.
speaker1: sell it? carl, we just bought it.
speaker3: what i wouldn't do for a place like this.
speaker2: it's gonna be great.

speaker1: oh, by the way, sam, i had to move your 3:00 with bob kahan to 4:00 so you could squeeze in gary alan. he called yesterday and said he has to see you today about the danway stuff. three o'clock was the only time he could make it. also, the board meeting in l.a. has been confirmed for the 12th. i got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight. 
speaker1: hey, sam, relax. this isn't brain surgery you're going into.
speaker2: i hate pitching to these japanese guys. they make me nervous. i mean, what am i supposed to say, "who do you think'll win that big sumo championship"?
speaker1: sam, you'll be fine. you're great with people.
speaker1: hey, nice. i like those.
speaker2: ...molly.
speaker1: look at that, a testerossa. that's the car i'm gonna drive when i'm making two hundred grand.
speaker2: better pay off your mustang first.

speaker1: so carl, what did the doctor say? 
speaker2: he said it was contagious. very contagious. i shouldn't be going into work today. but what could i do?
speaker1: and what about the rash?
speaker2: not good. it's spreading everywhere.
speaker1: on your again?
speaker2: everywhere. he said be sure not to touch anyone.

speaker1: morning, mr. wheat. 
speaker2: morning rose. listen, when the kobiashi people arrive, have elenore take them right to the...
speaker1: they're already here.
speaker2: they're early!
speaker1: i know. and andy dillon called. he said they need $900,000 transferred to albany by noon.
speaker2: noon?
speaker3: hold on.
speaker2: listen, dillon needs $900,000 in albany by noon. can you transfer it to his payroll account?
speaker3: sure. just let me have your mac code.
speaker2: discretion, huh?
speaker3: you bet. i'll do it right away.

speaker1: good morning, gentlemen. on behalf of market security bank and trust, i welcome you to our city. 
speaker2: arigato.
speaker1: i'm afraid that's the only japanese i know. but i realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to market security. rather, i'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. as you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in new york. but, with combined assets of over 200 billion dollars, we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace.
speaker1: excuse me. hello?

speaker1: uh hmm. 
speaker2: it's raining outside. the man, running naked along the street, sees some joggers approaching.
speaker2: one of the joggers calls out. "hey, do you always go jogging naked?" and the man says, "yes, always."
speaker1: okay.
speaker2: and then the other jogger says, "and do you always wear a condom?" the man looks down, embarrassed, and replies, "only when it's raining." sam squelches a smile.
speaker1: well, that's just fine.
speaker2: now just relax and have fun, okay? it's not the end of the world if you lose this account. you've always got me.
speaker1: thank you. i'll remember that.
speaker2: see ya.

speaker1: where you guys from, the new york city ballet? 
speaker2: saved your life.
speaker1: you bastard. don't do that to me. you scared me half to death.
speaker2: better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street. here, look out.
speaker3: sam? molly? anybody home?
speaker1: carl? did you invite him?
speaker2: i couldn't keep him away.
speaker3: hi, moll. hi, sam. so, how's it goin?
speaker4: where do you want this?
speaker1: in the bedroom.

speaker1: wow! the place looks great. really great. 
speaker2: you like it, huh?
speaker1: "like" is hardly the word. i never imagined it would be this beautiful. this is incredible.
speaker2: sam, you kept that chair?
speaker3: what do you mean? it's comfortable. for t.v. i love that chair.
speaker2: but it doesn't go with anything.
speaker3: it goes with me.
speaker2: it's okay, i'll paint it.

speaker1: it was the middle of december. i was sitting in my old office, the one charlie's in. suddenly, i heard this woman screaming. i thought someone'd been shot or something. 
speaker2: they took away my mastercard. it was christmas, for godssake.
speaker1: she was four thousand dollars over her limit.
speaker2: it wasn't four thousand. and i'd already sent in the payment! you're the ones that lost it.
speaker1: she's still angry.
speaker2: no i'm not.
speaker1: get outta here, frank! you should have seen her. all pink and flushed. her skin was gorgeous, like a rose. and she's screaming, demanding to see the president. so wilton brought her to me.
speaker3: you? you weren't even a vp yet.
speaker1: she didn't know that.
speaker2: can you believe it? and the next thing i know, he's telling me his life story. i couldn't believe it. everything. about his divorce, how he'd just arrived in new york, how he didn't know any women. and all with this montana accent.
speaker1: what's a montana accent?
speaker2: the one you always slip into it when you get nervous. "yes, ma'am. thank you, ma'am. can i fondle your breasts, ma'am?"
speaker1: i wasn't nervous.
speaker2: admit it. you liked me. you were interested.
speaker1: i thought you were cute.
speaker2: cute? do you believe this? i should have been picasso's mistress. i should have been living in barcelona or paris. but no, i'm moving in with a new york banker who thinks i'm cute. she looks at sam and grins. carl is staring at molly, obviously turned on by her. he is embarrassed when she catches his gaze and quickly looks away.

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: i felt inspired.
speaker1: at 2:00 am?
speaker1: you notice carl's eyes today? they were all over you.
speaker2: what? are you jealous? sam, let me tell you something. he's not even looking at me. it's you he idolizes. he doesn't see me at all... anyway, he's not my type.
speaker2: what are you doing?
speaker1: i feel inspired.

speaker1: what's the matter? 
speaker2: the matter?
speaker1: i can tell.
speaker2: nothing... really.
speaker1: you're worried, aren't you? about moving in together?
speaker2: no. not really.
speaker1: then what? the promotion?
speaker2: i don't know. a lot of things. i just don't want the bubble to burst... whenever something good happens to me i'm just afraid i'm going to lose it.
speaker1: you know what?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: i love you. i really love you.
speaker2: ditto.
speaker2: oh another one.
speaker1: don't watch that stuff.
speaker3: ...it is estimated that 34 people died in the crash, the second in less than two weeks.
speaker2: i should cancel my l.a. trip... these things always happen in threes.
speaker1: threes? sam, get serious. besides, you lead a charmed life.
speaker2: yeah. so did they. sam looks at her and then back at the screen.
speaker2: amazing, huh? just like that. blackout.

speaker1: a glitch. what's up? 
speaker2: the mark greenberg and larry white accounts. i can't get in. your mac code doesn't work.
speaker1: i changed it.
speaker2: why? what's up?
speaker1: nothing. i just want to nose around a bit... can you keep your mouth shut?
speaker2: yeah, sure. tell me, what's going on.
speaker1: i think i've stumbled onto something. there's too much money in these accounts.
speaker2: too much money. that's ridiculous. how could there be too much money?
speaker1: that's what i keep asking myself.
speaker2: it must be the computer.
speaker1: i've been checking.
speaker2: yeah, mr. fixit. come on, move over. let me see what i can do.
speaker1: not yet. i'm gonna dig around a bit.
speaker2: okay, okay. just call me when you're ready for help. so, what are you and moll doing tonight?
speaker1: we're going to the theatre. she wants to see "macbeth" at the spring street repertory.

speaker1: i loved it. 
speaker2: i could tell.
speaker2: did i tell you what marcia said?
speaker1: six times.
speaker2: six? no i didn't. sam, don't be so blasã©. i'll have two major pieces in the show. the new york times reviews her gallery all the time. this could be huge.
speaker1: molly, the "new york times" is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his who flunked out of art school. who cares what the new york times thinks?
speaker2: eight million readers, that's who.
speaker1: your work's beautiful. that's a fact, moll. it doesn't matter what anyone thinks.
speaker2: i want to marry you, sam.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i've been thinking about it for days. more than thinking. i want to do it. i want to jump in whole hog... what is that look for?
speaker1: it's just been so long since... i mean, you never wanted to talk about it.
speaker2: do you love me, sam?
speaker1: what do you think, moll?
speaker2: how come you never say it?
speaker1: what are you talking about?
speaker2: you say "ditto". it's not the same.
speaker1: people say "i love you" all the time. it doesn't mean anything.
speaker2: sometimes you need to hear it.

speaker1: what should we do? 
speaker2: let me handle this.
speaker3: your wallet!
speaker1: give it to him!
speaker2: take the money. just leave the wallet and my...
speaker1: sam, no!
speaker1: sam!!!!!
speaker2: molly!

speaker1: no!!!!!! 
speaker1: help me!
speaker1: do it! do it!

speaker1: molly? molly! 
speaker2: sam? what's the matter? is something wrong?
speaker1: molly!
speaker2: what is it, honey?
speaker2: what is it, honey?

speaker1: molly! 
speaker1: molly.

speaker1: so, what happened to you? 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: you're new, huh? i can tell.
speaker2: are you talking to me?
speaker1: relax. it ain't like before, you know. it's a whole new ball-a-wax.
speaker2: who are you?
speaker1: i'm waiting for my wife. she's in 4c. cardiac wing. she's fighting it.
speaker1: shot, huh? that'll do it every time. poor bastard. well, get used to it. you could be here a long time. i'll tell you a secret. doors ain't as bad as you think. zip zap. they ain't nothin' at all. you'll see. you'll catch on. suddenly there is a loud commotion and we see several physicians operating furiously on an old man lying on the table beside them. it is a life threatening situation and they seem to be failing.
speaker1: he ain't gonna make it. i've seen it a million times. he's a goner. see? here they come. lucky bastard. could have been the other ones. you never know.

speaker1: hurry, we're losing him. 
speaker2: what'd i tell you? bingo!
speaker1: he's gone.

speaker1: who are you? what's happening...? 
speaker1: no!

speaker1: as we say farewell to our friend sam wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit... 
speaker1: as our loved one enters eternal life, let us remember that love, too, is eternal, that although we will miss him, our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.

speaker1: molly. 
speaker2: ...and into your hands we commend his spirit. may he rest in peace. in the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost. amen.

speaker1: leaving the cemetery. we hear them talking. 
speaker2: what time you going back to work?... what's the buzz on digital? it's sad. he was so young... how's your new honda?... going away this weekend?

speaker1: molly, there's no one on earth who'd like it to be true more than me, but you've got to be rational about this. i understand your desire to hold on to him, but this... this is absurd. 
speaker2: it was real, carl. she was real.
speaker3: listen to her, carl, it. she needs some support here.
speaker1: molly, you're a grown woman. how can you believe some fortune teller from brooklyn...?
speaker2: she was in touch with him.
speaker1: i don't believe it, molly. not for a minute.
speaker3: come on, carl. open your mind.
speaker2: carl, she knew things.
speaker1: what kind of things?
speaker2: i told you, the picture in reno, the starfish,... it, carl. she said sam knew who killed him. that he was set up... murdered.
speaker1: oh boy. this is getting deranged. we're going off the deep end here.
speaker3: give him the address, moll.
speaker2: she had a name, an address -- willie lopez, 321 prospect place. she said he had sam's wallet.
speaker1: this is sick. this is really sick. how can you swallow this crap? who knows if this guy exists? maybe she's just setting someone up.
speaker2: that's what i have to find out.
speaker1: find out? what are you talking about?
speaker2: sam wants me to go to the police.
speaker1: sam wants you to go to the police? molly! are you outta your mind? what are you gonna tell 'em? some storefront psychic's been getting messages from the dead? do you know how that sounds? you're talkin' ghosts here, for sake.
speaker1: i'm sorry. this stuff just really gets to me.
speaker2: you don't believe me. you don't believe any of this, do you?

speaker1: carl, what're you doin' here? 
speaker2: who've you been talking to?
speaker1: talking to? what the do you mean? what's going on?
speaker2: some woman knows all about you. the murder, everything. where's she getting it from, huh?
speaker1: what the are you talking about? i haven't said a word.
speaker2: she knows your name, it! she knows where you live!
speaker1: a lot of women know where i live.
speaker2: this isn't a joke, man. you find that whoever she is, and... get rid of her, you hear me? i've got four million dollars stuck in that computer. if i don't get those codes, if that money's not transferred soon, i'm dead. if i lose balistrari's money, we're both dead.
speaker1: tell him you only wash dirty money on the first of the month.
speaker2: what is wrong with you? is everything a joke? you were supposed to steal his wallet. you weren't supposed to kill him. was that a joke?
speaker1: i did you a favor. freebee.
speaker2: these are drug dealers, man. don't blow this for me, willie. i've risked my job here. i could go to jail. a hundred thousand of that money goes to me. now give me sam's key. i'll get that address book myself. willie goes to the desk drawer and takes out sam's key. sam, unable to control himself, explodes in a fit of rage. hauling back, he slugs carl with all his might. his fist has no impact.
speaker3: you killed me, carl. you had me killed. look what you've done to me! look what you've done!

speaker1: look, you've gotta believe me. i don't even believe this stuff, myself. but this is real. do you think i'd come here if it wasn't real? you told me to come if i had any new information. well, here i am. 
speaker1: don't look at me like that. you guys use psychics all the time.
speaker1: it. i know how this sounds. i hear myself saying it and i want to cringe. but this woman knew things she couldn't have known, intimate details.
speaker2: how intimate?
speaker1: things sam only said to me.
speaker2: okay, let me get this straight. according to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place, watching us all the time, huh?... i'm sorry. i've got important things to do. she leaves the room. molly gives her a dirty look and turns to beiderman.
speaker1: i'm telling you. the killer's name is willie lopez. i've got his address. you've got to check it out.
speaker3: okay. you just wait here. let me see if this guy's got a record.

speaker1: what are you doing? where's your file on willie lopez? 
speaker2: there's no file for a willie lopez. he was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with. this psychic woman's record goes back a long way. fraud, numbers rackets, you name it. she's a real pro.
speaker2: 1967. shreveport, louisiana. forgery, selling false id. served one year. 1971. baton rouge. arrested for fraud, numbers racketeering. served ten months. 1974. hattiesburg, mississippi. fraud, seven months. 1984. albany, new york. petty larceny. it goes on and on.
speaker2: this woman's a charlatan. you can't believe anything she said.
speaker1: this isn't possible. there were words, private things. how could she have known all that?
speaker2: they have ways.
speaker1: ways? what ways?
speaker2: they've got a million cons. a lot of times they read the obits. all she had to do was see the word "banker". hell, they even go through your garbage to find things they can use, letters, old papers. they don't need much.
speaker2: i bet you threw stuff out, huh? it could have been anything. what about that underwear she knew all about?
speaker2: green underwear. i'll bet she zeroed right in on that.
speaker1: no! she was real. she said things. she knew about a sweater i knitted, about songs we sang... she knew about this place we went, montego bay...
speaker2: i'm sorry. i know this is hard. people want so much to believe. they're grieving, vulnerable. they'd give anything for one last moment... money, insurance policies. believe me, these people know what they're doing. look, i know how you must feel. you know, you can press charges.
speaker1: oh i wanted it to be sam.

speaker1: let this be it! 
speaker1: oh yes!
speaker1: tony, this is carl. i'm all set. we're fine. everything's fine. just tell me what you want me to do.
speaker2: we want you to transfer the money from the 12 separate accounts into a single account under the name "rita miller". tomorrow, at five minutes before closing, 3:55 p. m., transfer the full account to first island bank of nassau, registry number 486-
speaker3: carl writes it all down.
speaker2: call us when it's done.
speaker1: tell mr. balistrari there won't be any problems.
speaker2: i'll do that.

speaker1: why can't you hear me, molly? i need you. suddenly the bell rings. molly jumps. 
speaker2: who's there?
speaker3: molly, it's carl. can i come up?
speaker1: don't open it. he's a murderer, moll!
speaker3: hi. thanks. i know it's late. i'm sorry to disturb you. i felt bad about last night. this supernatural stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. i don't even read horoscopes.
speaker2: don't worry. it's okay.
speaker3: no it's not. you needed me to hear you and i didn't and that was wrong. i want you to know that i'm your friend, moll.
speaker1: you were never our friend.
speaker3: hey, i brought you some japanese apple pears. i know you like them.
speaker2: oh, that's so sweet.
speaker3: listen, can i come in for a minute? i won't stay long. i've had one of those days. maybe a cup of coffee?
speaker1: no, moll. don't do it. don't let him in!
speaker2: sure.

speaker1: are you alright? you look nervous, upset. 
speaker2: what can i tell you. it's been tough. hell, you know. it still hurts so much. then on top of it all... it's the responsibilities. they've given me my own accounts, but i've had no time to adjust. my mind has been reeling.
speaker2: where were you this morning? i thought you were coming to the bank to sign those papers.
speaker1: i didn't have time. i went to the police, carl.
speaker2: you're kidding. you really did it? i don't believe... what did you tell them? what did they say?
speaker1: you were right, you know. i felt like such a fool. they brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick. it was awful.
speaker2: a ripoff artist, huh?
speaker3: molly, no.
speaker1: the sad part is that i believed her. i believed her, carl. it was all a sham.
speaker2: sometimes we need to believe.
speaker1: why?... i was a fool. i don't believe anything anymore. why would people do such things?
speaker2: it's hard to face reality, moll, the hard cold facts of it. what you have to remember is the love you felt. that's what's real. you have to remember how good sam was. how much he loved you. molly holds back tears. carl reaches out tenderly and strokes her hair.
speaker2: you were everything to him, molly. you were his life.
speaker1: i feel so alone.
speaker2: you're not alone. you're young. you've got so much talent. you're fantastically gorgeous.
speaker1: oh i don't know what's real anymore. i don't know what to think.
speaker2: just think about sam. think about what he meant to you, the years you had together, how wonderful they were.
speaker2: let your feelings out.
speaker3: no!!!

speaker1: i can't. i'm sorry. i can't. it's too soon... you've been great carl, but... i need you to leave. please. i need you to. 
speaker2: sure. it's okay. i understand. i really do.
speaker2: look, what if we have dinner tomorrow night? just talk. can i interest you in that?

speaker1: get off my train! 
speaker2: teach me how you do that! i want to learn! i'm not leaving til you teach me!
speaker1: you stubborn

speaker1: i don't get it. 
speaker2: it's your mind, you it's all in the mind. the problem is you think you're still real, that you're standin' on the floor, that you're wearin' those clothes. you don't even have a body anymore. it's all up here. you wanna move things, you gotta use your mind. you gotta focus! you hear what i'm saying?
speaker1: how do you focus?
speaker2: i don't know how you focus! you just focus!
speaker2: it's all in the anger. you gotta direct it. you gotta channel it.
speaker1: i'm angry all the time. it doesn't do a thing.
speaker2: cause you're angry all over. you gotta be angry here, in the pit of your stomach. bring it down here. let it explode. it's like a reactor, you know. pow!
speaker1: i did it!
speaker2: way to go.

speaker1: from your gut. what do i keep tellin' you? 
speaker2: how long have you been here?
speaker1: since they pushed me.
speaker2: someone pushed you?
speaker1: yeah, someone pushed me!
speaker2: who?
speaker1: what? you don't believe me? you think i fell? you think i jumped? well, you! it wasn't my time! i wasn't supposed to go! i'm not supposed to be here! venom spews from the ghost's mouth. suddenly he rams a
speaker1: who the are you? why are you hounding me like this? leave me alone.

speaker1: what the hell? 
speaker2: sam?
speaker1: what is all this? what's goin' on?
speaker2: what'd you do, tell every spook in town about me? i got spooks from out of town here. there's stuff goin' on you wouldn't believe. i can't hardly believe it myself.
speaker1: oda mae. you're doing it. this is for real. how do you like that?
speaker2: i don't.
speaker1: come on. look at this. you're doing great.
speaker3: can you hurry this up? my husband's in the waiting room.
speaker1: i need your help, oda mae. there's something we need to do.
speaker2: forget it. i'm not doin' anything. you're holdin' on to a life that don't want you no more. give it up.
speaker1: give it up? i'm already dead.
speaker2: dead, yeah, but you ain't finished dyin'. give up the ghost.
speaker1: and how am i supposed to do that?
speaker2: you're asking me?
speaker4: are you speaking to me?
speaker2: does it look like i'm speakin' to you? so, are you gonna leave or not? i've got work to do.
speaker2: what's a matter? you're supposed to be concentrating. how do you expect me to do this if you're not concentrating? okay then. you ready? let's do it.

speaker1: can you feel me, sam?
speaker3: with all my heart.
speaker2: with all his heart, he says.
