BILLY: but it was my first time. i'm not really a smuggler, was just two kilos.
TEX: well, you see billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. the turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.

BILLY: years?
ERICH: don't pay too much attention, anything is possible in turkey. you might get bail.
ERICH: ...if you make bail, you're free. you can get a fake passport or sneak across the border to greece. the greeks hate the turks so much they never send you back. the turks know it. they just keep the bail. money.
BELL: sure, keep dreaming and see where that gets you... like max, up in the head, you know... you gonna eat a lot more fasoulia beans, billy baby, 'fore you taste a hamburger 'gain cause you broke the law man, and you got caught... and that... is history.
ERICH: the law is sometimes wrong.
ERICH: new people sometimes get on his nerves.
BILLY: what did he do?

ERIC: he was caught steeling from a mosque. that's heavy here. he got 30 years. 
BILLY: thirty years?
ERICH: jimmy has more than brains. he didn't tell his parents he was in jail for a year and a half. he says he got himself in and now he's going to get himself out. he shakes his head, looking at:
BILLY: and you?
ERICH: hashish. ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
BILLY: what they give you?
ERICH: twelve years.
BILLY: how much did you have?
ERICH: a hundred grams.
BILLY: it's not fair!
ERICH: there is no fair in turkey, billy. it's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. an italian hippie had a car accident and a turk was killed. so, they threw him in here for six months...
BILLY: that doesn't seem so bad.
ERICH: but he was eating lunch a mile away when the turk smashed into killed himself.
BILLY: he wasn't even in the car?
ERICH: aslan, there...
ERICH: killed a guy. but his father's a big gangster on the docks. a "kapidiye." he'll stay in... twelve months no more, and get parole. in turkey, murder is manly - "erkek".
ERICH: you just got to get yourself a good lawyer. and some money... talk to max. he's been in the longest.
BILLY: how long?
ERICH: seven years...

MAX: gastro. stomach medicine. has codeine in it... best can do pulls out the needle, loosens the tourniquet. his eyes take on a far away stare. 
ERICH: lawyers?

ERICH: his name?
MAX: who?
ERICH: the lawyer?

ERICH: who got the frenchman out?
MAX: oh yesil... yesil's his name but i...don't know anything... 'bout...yesil...

BILLY: what's that?

FATHER: billy! 
BILLY: dad!
BILLY: dad...i'm...

FATHER: ...don't worry about it. i can punch you in the nose later. right now we've got to get you out of here. you all right? 
BILLY: yeah. how's mom?
FATHER: bad. she couldn't make the trip. you know her boy... susan told us before we got your letter. she's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
BILLY: no, don't let her! i'll... how about peg? robbie?
FATHER: same. none of the neighbors know. we told them you were in a hospital in europe. oh... this is stanley davis. he's the american consul here... and necdit yesil, the lawyer you wanted...

DAVIS: hello, billy. 
BILLY: hello.
DAVIS: i want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. believe me.
BILLY: thank you.

YESIL: vilyum, i am necdit yesil. 
BILLY: mr. yesil.
YESIL: i know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge, i arrange everything - just right. and i think we get you bail. if very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... but i think we get you bail...
YESIL: you know i have lectured at the university of maryland in your country? also university michigan very nice country. we both go back.
BILLY: if i get bail, mister yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into greece?
FATHER: right! that's what we're shooting for. mister davis and have been in contact with the state department, but right now relations with the turks aren't too good, nixon's upset the out of them. our best bet's... right here.
BILLY: dad... i'll pay you back for all this, i promise.

FATHER: don't worry about it. right now money doesn't count. okay? 
FATHER: where'd you get that limp?
BILLY: nothing. just twisted my ankle.
BILLY: where you staying, dad?
FATHER: the hilton.
BILLY: how do you like it? istanbul?
FATHER: well, it's an interesting place... tell you the truth, i think the food is lousy. the they sell in these little restaurants. i went out to eat in one of them last night, and i had to run to the toilet... you shoulda' seen the toilet.
BILLY: you mean you got toilets?
FATHER: yeah, with real toilet paper - and you don't have to use both sides.
FATHER: so now i'm eating at the hilton every night.
FATHER: why'd you do it, billy?
BILLY: for the money...
FATHER: i know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, billy. stupid.
BILLY: i know.
BILLY: dad get me out of here.
BILLY: okay.
PROSECUTOR VOICE: ...we must alter this image by punishing only our own drug smugglers-but by handing out foreigners who infest our culture with their depravity ungodly and behavior. we must start now - by sentencing this american, vilyum hi-yes, to the maximum sentence for smuggling, to be held up to the light of the world as an example of turkish justice and its intention to halt the drug trade once and for all.. .i ask the court therefore to sentence vilyum hi-yes to life imprisonment.
PROSECUTOR VOICE: he sits, staring malignantly at billy.
JUDGE: thank you, prosecutor. the court will now recess to consider its verdict. the judges exit.
BILLY: what'd the prosecutor say?
YESIL: it's not important, just technical things. we make our case. you were very good, you spoke well. the judge like you. it look good. don't worry.
BILLY: did you ask for bail?

JUDGE: the defendant has been found guilty by the court of the illegal possession of hashish... 
JUDGE: ...therefore. this court sentences you, vilyum hi-yes to be imprisoned at sagamilcar prison for a term of four years and two months. this case is now closed.
YESILF: four years, two months. it's good.
FATHER: four years!
YESIL: we appeal it. billy watching this, a lost look.
YESIL: you will see, he will have maybe one year taken off this sentence for good behaviour. remember, it is only for possession; the prosecutor wanted life sentence for smuggling... to be honest mr. hayes, it is a great victory!
FATHER: ...with good time billy it works out to about 3 years... then there's the appeal. yesil, davis, they're all working for you we're going to try to make a deal to get you transferred to a stateside prison. and davis thinks there might be a political amnesty any month... stops. knows it sounds bad.
FATHER: look - i know it sounds tough, billy, but we're gonna get you out...
FATHER: ...i promise you, but i don't want you to get stupid again. pull anything. they can play with your sentence.
FATTIER: i'm putting $500 in the bank for you. anything you need you write...
FATHER: there's food, candy, writing paper, soap, books... ...cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush, there's... i been writing insurance policies on people for thirty years... and now i gotta see my own son...jesus! if i could be where you are billy, i'd be there... these bastards.

FATHER: oh 
FATHER: you take good care of my boy, you hear, or i'll have your head, you turkish bastard! it sputters out of his mouth, senseless to:

BILLY'S VOICE: dear susan. 1970 has now passed into 1971. you can drift in here and never know you're gone. you can fade so far out and you don't know where you are anymore or where anything else is... 
BILLY'S VOICE: i find loneliness is a physical pain which hurts all over; you can't isolate it in one part of your body. i so much need your softness, your strength. i have your letters. they charge me, give me courage.news about amnesty and getting out - tangled, complicated... the camera lingers on ziat in a far corner of the kogus, top bunk, against a wall. never secure, he shuffles in his sleep.
VOICE: ...i feel myself drifting more heavily into smoking hashish. the haze helps the time pass. also i do soap carvings. erich taught me. and i have been learning turkish because it helps me to deal with the guards and the prisoners. i'm trying hard to maintain some sort of schedule to my life, but sometimes it seems like i'm just trying in order to try...

BILLY'S VOICE: ...to the turks all foreigners are "ayip" - unclean, dirty. we don't shave our under-arms or around our crotch... 
BILLY VOICE: even the yoga i sometimes do is "ayip" - too suggestive... the turk scowls back at bell, huddles menacingly with another turk.

BILLY'S VOICE: and you're never supposed to eat with your left hand. you know why? because that's what they use to wipe their with instead of toilet paper. and yet they hate pigs. there are no pigs in turkey. they're considered dirty... 
HAMIDOU: unfortunately my youngest son arief is having problems with his teeth; he needs braces, but dentists are so expensive these days
ASLAN: poor kid... you know i have a friend, a very good friend; he's a dentist; maybe he could get you some braces at a... reasonable price.
ASLAN: yes. please! as a favour... i insist they go on, each protesting.
BILLY VOICE: hamidou hints that he needs new braces for one of his sons. aslan of course has a friend who's a dentist. they for half an hour and hamidou finally accepts the "baksheesh" in return... a burlap bag comes flying over the wall of the courtyard late at night. then another comes over, lands in the yard. one is around.
BILLY VOICE: dope and all kinds of shipments get delivered to aslan, who re- sells it through his runners. people like ziat. but one night, it backfired... a third bag comes over, gets caught on a hooknail and rips right open. hundreds of yellow pills spill out.

BILLY VOICE: there were thousands of yellow nembutols. aslan as usual had the privilege of going into the courtyard before anybody else to pick up his stuff but... aslan arguing vehemently with a guard, in his ragged uniform, who won't open the cell of the first floor kogus into the courtyard. 
BILLY'S VOICE: ...it happened to be a new guard that day and he didn't understand the system.
GUARD: no. it's too early.
ASLAN: open the gate, you asshole! do you know who i am? you want to get in trouble!

PRISON DIRECTOR: aslan...be reasonable. come down and talk. 
ASLAN: you come up here and talk!
PRISON DIRECTOR: aslan... if you give up the gun, you can keep the bullets
BILLY'S VOICE: ...i know all this must sound crazy to you, but this place is crazy...

HAMIDOU: you see mamur, mamet - what happens when you're not a good boy. 
BILLY VOICE: then there's ziat. the more i know of him...

BILLY VOICE: ...the more hate him. 
MAX: ten dollars for this you greedy one-eyed git.
ZIAT: no! is good! me good
MAX: no! you big
ZIAT: yeah! efe big

MAX: you asshole! 
MAX: hikmet come here boy. hikmet ziat shrugs. so what?
BILLY: what is it with you man, what the is it?
ZIAT: cat, ah! ayip!
BILLY: you're ayip!
ZIAT: look, you don't with me, i don't with you, right?
BILLY: but you with me. you with me all the time. you make crummy tea. you rip us off on the hash.
ZIAT: i make special tea for you, hiyes, okay? we've to live like brothers. we have to be in here together.
ZIAT: you 'merican. you don't know.
BILLY: know what?
ZIAT: was.. ...seven years old. i was on street in suk. buy. sell. no family to take care. i learn.
BILLY: learn what?
ZIAT: dog eat dog, hi-yes. you other man before he you. and you must last.
BILLY: that's a great philosophy.
ZIAT: you 'merican. you don't know.
MAX: here hikmet! come down here boy! hikmet... rafter nothing.
MAX: sodding cat!

SUSAN'S VOICE: ...but i cannot say i am for it. nor are your parents. they consulted the priest, and he said to send you money for that reason would be like sealing your death. 
BELL: the blueprints!
MAX: to what?
BELL: the prison, man. there was this german cat an architect in the hospital. he was helping the turks build some round the place. i laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.

MAX: too bad you didn't have a machine. 
BELL: there's two ways out i figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. the other way is under.
BILLY: tunnel?
BELL: it's already built! there's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the christians built 'bout a thousand years ago to bury their dead. we're sitting right on top of it -- here. insert drawing, illustrating roughly the structure of the prison. his finger tracing, bubbling with nervous enthusiasm.
BELL: the kraut said there's a whole bunch of hollow sealed shafts sort of like dumbwaiters running along this wall; one of them is right in there, right next to our shower. we get in there, he says, we can get down into the catacombs. with three of us working....
MAX: gotta be here someplace. thought i heard a couple of dead christians singing down there.

BELL: stop me, man! 
BILLY: but how would you get into the shaft, jimmy?
MAX: i suppose you knock three times and ask for st. peter.
BELL: hey! i'm getting this together man and i don't need no gastro-head along on this trip! we go through the wall.
BILLY: we go through the wall?
MAX: we go through the wall.
BELL: ...the kraut was right! i checked it out - there's no reinforced steel in those bath walls. they're real soft from underground seepage--
BELL: --the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. all we do is use gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our down the shaft, it's a two night operation, maybe three.
MAX: and what do you do when you in the catacombs?
BELL: the catacoombs? whaddya want, a door? there's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in istanbul.
MAX: you gotta be crazy! you got stabbed in the once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
BILLY: section 13?

MAX: yeah, for the criminally insane. i was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. it's awful. namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time... 
BILLY: where is it?
MAX: i don' t know. it's someplace down in there.... ..deep.. a big door...a wheel....

BELL: hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here? it's not a map, max. it's our balls. you know what i mean... ...i gotta get laid man, i don't know 'bout you guys, but if i don't get it on soon, i'm... i'm not gonna make it. 
MAX: 
BELL: billy?
BILLY: ...the roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall. ziat's round there all the time. but the roof....
BILLY: the bullet percentage is awful high.
BILLY: if i get caught, jimmy, i'm facing another months. i'd be back up to 3 years, maybe more... looks down.
BELL: well it! choose your own death, babe, i'm taking the roof out of here!

BILLY'S VOICE: ...i have problems with my stomach and my leg muscles feel very weak. my gums seem to be shrinking and they sometimes bleed when i massage them... they've pulled five of my teeth... 
BILLY'S VOICE: ...sometimes they null the wrong one...

BILLY VOICE: ...even my dreams don't seem to work any more. because the outside doesn't seem real any more. it's not even a fantasy...because there is no fantasy. 
BILLY'S VOICE: even masturbation has become boring. it teaches you, like the rest of prison life, to seal up your emotions, and this is the greatest danger, this is what makes so many of the men change into something monstrous... eyes of the arabs peer through the musky vapors at billy and erich; they loll about the door curious, lecherous for their bodies.

BILLY VOICE: ...and now strange as it seems, susan, without having seen you in so long i feel myself more inside of you than ever before. i feel your female mind. i sense you, touch you; ...know you; and find myself falling more and more... in love with you. 
BILLY: a prison a monastery a cloister a cave, prison monastery cloister cave, prison monastery cloister cave, prison monastery cloister cave, prison monastery cloister...

BILLY: prison. 
BILLY'S VOICE: dear susan. erich has been transferred to a prison back in sweden. he has profoundly affected my life and though i am lonely without him i am calmer than ever...
BILLY'S VOICE: though i only have 53 days left, i feel i have never been so well adjusted to prison and to living as now....
BELL: allah off!

BELL: asina covaciml. he is noticeably pale and weaker than before. 
BILLY'S VOICE: ...poor jimmy...
BILLY VOICE: ...though his health is bad he still won't give up...
BILLY: what's wrong?
DAVIS: sit down a moment, billy. i'm afraid i have some bad news for you.
BILLY: something happen to dad?... mom?
DAVIS: no... it looks like your going to have a new court.
BILLY: what do you mean?
DAVIS: the prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the high court in ankara reviewed it.

BILLY: and? 
DAVIS: we've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
DAVIS: there were 35 judges on the high court. twenty eight of them voted for a life sentence.
DAVIS: the lower court in istanbul will have to go along with the decision. the judge likes you and he'll do the only thing he can do under the law.... . he'll reduce the sentence to thirty years... we're notified... billy.
BILLY: what do you mean life for for what!

BILLY: but i spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and i think i paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years, i... 
I...: you know my lawyers told me 'be cool billy don't get upset, don't get angry, if you're good i can maybe get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal, this that and the other thing.' well that's been going down now for 35 years... yesil looks over, surprised he is talking like this. looks at davis.

BILLY: and i've been playing it cool and i've been good and now i'm tired of being good cause you people gave me the belief that i had 53 days left. you hung 53 days in front of my eyes and then you took those 53 days away, and mister prosecutor! i just wish you could... 
BILLY: ... stand right here where i'm standing and feel what that... ...feels like, cause then you'd know something you don't know you'd know what means, mister prosecutor and you'd know the concept of a society is based on the quality of its mercy means, of its sense of fair play, its sense of justice... but i guess that's just like asking a bear to in a toilet...

BILLY: for a nation of pigs, it's funny you don't eat them. it, give me the sentence. forgave the bastards, but i can't. i hate you. nation. i hate your i hate your people. and i your sons and daughters! 
BILLY: ...cause you're all pigs.

TRANSLATOR: would your honor like me to translate? 
JUDGE: that won't be necessary
JUDGE: my hands are tied by ankara!
TRANSLATOR: my hands are tied by ankara!

JUDGE: ... to be imprisoned at sagamilcar for a term no less than thirty years...getchmis olsun 
TRANSLATOR: "i must sentence you, vilyum hiyes, to be imprisoned at sagamilcar for a term no less than years... "getchmis olsun"

SONG OVER: "busted at the border two keys in my shoes said i was busted at the border with two keys in my shoes an they gave me thirty years, babe to learn the old istanbul blues..." 
SONG OVER: "i said lord now save me please save me from this pain" billy, touched - listening, thinking.
SONG OVER: "i said lord come and save me, come save me from this pain come set me free sweet jesus..."
TURK: hey knock off that music...
TURK: ...we're playing the sas.
BELL: omina koyden your sas! the two turks tense, the mood changing.
BELL: ...and besides that i allah and i your muslim mother too...
BELL: you got that, face? asina...
