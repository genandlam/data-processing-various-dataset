speaker1: what time is it? 
speaker2: four. why?
speaker1: this milk is bad.
speaker2: when did you buy it?
speaker1: tuesday? i don't know. what's today?
speaker2: monday. there's a deli on broadway.
speaker1: nothing closer?
speaker2: nothing that's open.
speaker1: is it that bad?
speaker2: i don't know. you're the one who said it was bad.

speaker1: this is the worst coffee i've had in my life. 
speaker2: then don't drink it.
speaker3: what're we doing today?
speaker1: "interior. living room. ellen talks to mom."
speaker4: any nudity?
speaker2: yeah, you have to take your pants off.
speaker4: i'll do it. i like ellen.
speaker3: yeah, she's a babe. she was the nurse in that richard gere movie.
speaker5: i worked on that.
speaker4: the shower scene.
speaker1: start with the 5k in the window. run feeders for three blonds into the living room.
speaker3: two people. sitting? standing?
speaker1: who knows?
speaker3: "ellen talks to mom."

speaker1: tired? 
speaker2: no, i've been up since four. i've got a big scene today and i'm kind of nervous.
speaker1: "ellen talks to mom."
speaker2: have you read the script?
speaker1: no. it's on the callsheet.
speaker2: oh. well, it's pretty emotional. i tell my mother i never felt she really loved me.
speaker1: you're going to yell at each other?
speaker2: i don't know. i'm just going to go with how i feel. which is the scary part. i'm very close to this character.
speaker1: problems with your own mom?
speaker2: yes. but she died before i, well before we could reconcile...
speaker1: you were great in that richard gere movie.
speaker2: thanks.

speaker1: good morning, "mom." 
speaker2: morning.
speaker1: sleep well?
speaker2: not a wink.

speaker1: look, i'm not blaming anybody, wanda. i'm just saying we left last night and i knew we didn't get that scene. 
speaker2: i'm sorry, i thought it was a great scene, nick.
speaker1: it was ok; and it's going to be alright. but i'm not settling for ok today. this is a big scene and i'm not leaving till we get it.
speaker2: whatever it takes, nick. we're here for you.
speaker1: alright, here's what i'm thinking. wolf, i want to do the whole scene in one shot.
speaker3: it's been done.
speaker1: i know that but i'd like to try it anyway.
speaker3: handheld.
speaker1: no, dolly. we go from close-up to wide-shot and back to close-up in the same shot.
speaker3: i'll use the 35, minimize distortion; i'll light it all from the ceiling. it could be kind of great.
speaker2: sounds incredible. how long, wolf?
speaker3: i'll need to see a couple run- throughs.
speaker1: not too many. it's a tough scene for the actors. i want them to feel relaxed, fresh...
speaker2: we've got all day, nick. whatever it takes. what do you think, wolf -- an hour, 45?
speaker3: i don't know how you drink that black, nick. i got to dump in the milk. it's the only way i can cut the taste.
speaker1: 
speaker3: what the
speaker2: flame on, asshole!!

speaker1: ok, picture's up. quiet. stop the work. lock it up. going for picture. 
speaker2: ok, nice and easy. cora you're doing fine. remember, really listen and really answer. i've got nothing to say to you. just let it happen. it's all there.
speaker1: ready, nick?
speaker3: look at this a second, nick.
speaker3: i pushed in a foot. she's incredible. it's coming right through the lens.
speaker2: that's great, man. beautiful.

speaker5: rolling!
speaker6: scene six, take one.
speaker2: action.

speaker1: dad hit me first and knocked me down. it didn't hurt that much but i started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. he went over and started hitting danny. 
speaker2: ellen, i have no memory of this whatsoever.
speaker1: you were just standing there looking at me. then you pulled me up and said, "you're not hurt." like i was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing i could think of to keep him from hitting me again.
speaker2: i was worried about danny.
speaker1: you do remember.
speaker2: he was smaller than you.
speaker1: you were so worried about danny --

speaker1: cut! boom in. sorry, i had to cut. les, your boom was all the way in the shot. 
speaker2: well, where's the frame line?
speaker3: ok, can we get a frame line? hold it down. we're going again right away. nobody moves. les, you got the frame line?
speaker2: i guess so.

speaker1: dad hit me first and knocked me down. it didn't hurt that much but i started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. he went over and started hitting danny. 
speaker2: ellen, i -- the image suddenly goes out of focus.

speaker1: i'm sorry, i have to cut. i was completely off on the focus. it's my fault, i'm sorry. 
speaker2: thanks for the apology but you'll never work in this town again.
speaker1: i've got it now.

speaker1: street noise! 
speaker2: that's a cut! what the fuck's going on down there!? you call that a lock-up!? get that car out of there!
speaker3: christ. why doesn't the guy just get a flatbed trailer with about 600 speakers on it and tow it behind his car.
speaker1: and... it's clear.
speaker2: do i have a lock-up?

speaker2: ellen, i have no memory of this whatsoever.
speaker1: you were just standing there looking at me. then you pulled -- suddenly the boom drops into frame again.

speaker1: boom's in. 
speaker2: christ.
speaker3: where?
speaker1: the whole left side of frame, les.
speaker4: alright, can we please get a frame line please?!
speaker3: the frame keeps changing.
speaker1: that's the idea, les.
speaker5: may i make a suggestion? is it possible to maybe break the shot down? maybe two shots instead? might make it easier for les.
speaker2: no.
speaker5: then i need ten minutes to switch to radio mikes.
speaker4: your call, nick.
speaker2: there won't be any other sound problems?
speaker5: no more boom problems.
speaker2: switch to radios.
speaker4: that's a ten-minute break. release the lock-up. stand by.
speaker1: get me a coffee. half milk.

speaker1: i'm sorry about all this, nicole. 
speaker2: it's not your fault, nick. is there a way to use some of the earlier takes?
speaker1: not unless i change the shot; do a cutaway of cora or something and intercut the takes. i don't want to do that. it's a really nice shot and what you're doing is incredible.
speaker2: thanks, nick.
speaker1: the radio mikes are going to make everything easier. so, look. take a moment. let all this go. we don't roll till you're ready.

speaker1: how was she in that richard gere movie? 
speaker2: so-so.
speaker1: her career really took off, didn't it?
speaker2: i saw her in a michael bolton video.
speaker1: she is nice; but i could do a better job.

speaker1: where's that flag going? 
speaker2: it's a scrim.
speaker1: wolf!

speaker2: oh,

speaker1: christ! 
speaker2: kill it. kill it. pull the plug. right there by your foot.
speaker3: that's a cut. anybody hurt? cora, are you alright?
speaker3: props. props! let's get a broom up here right away. clear the set!

speaker1: well, let's see. what do you think is going to happen next, cora? 
speaker2: i'm going to have a heart attack!
speaker1: no, you're not. you're going in there in two minutes and we are really going to nail this scene. i know it. i have no doubt about it. nicole...
speaker3: nick! nick!
speaker1: one second!
speaker2: i'll tell you this much right now; i am never, ever doing another low-budget movie.

speaker1: what's up? 
speaker2: wolf and i were talking... ellen's losing it a little bit. you got three quarters of the scene really, really incredible in the first take. do a quick cut-away and all you need is a pickup of the last part of the scene.
speaker1: wolf?
speaker3: you know how i feel; i love this shot. hell, i designed it.
speaker1: then let's just stick with the game plan, ok? it's a simple shot. we're going to get it this time, i feel it.
speaker2: we're here for you, nick. whatever it takes.
speaker2: thanks.

speaker1: and, roll sound. 
speaker2: speed!
speaker1: and, roll camera!

speaker1: rolling!
speaker5: scene six, take seven.
speaker6: action.

speaker1: dad hit me first and knocked me down. it didn't hurt that much but i started crying anyway -- 
speaker2: i was worried about danny!
speaker1: i'm sorry, i'm lost...

speaker1: cut. it's ok. no big deal. 
speaker1: everyone relax. we're just going to run the lines. that's all. no acting. just run the lines. then we're going to shoot this scene.

speaker1: i'm so sorry. i'm this up for you. 
speaker2: and, action on the run-through.

speaker1: dad hit me first and knocked me down. it didn't hurt that much but i started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. he went over and started hitting danny. 
speaker2: ellen, i have no memory of this whatsoever.
speaker1: you were just standing there looking at me.
speaker3: roll camera... roll camera.
speaker3: where's wolf?
speaker4: in the bathroom... he doesn't feel good.
speaker3: get him! get him!
speaker1: then you pulled me up and said, "you're not hurt." like i was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing i could think of to keep him from hitting me again.
speaker2: i was worried about danny.
speaker1: you do remember.
speaker2: he was smaller than you.
speaker1: you were so worried about danny. what about me, mom? why weren't you worried about me?
speaker3: where the is wolf?!!!

speaker1: ok, listen up. nobody drinks the milk downstairs. ok? it appears to be bad. 
speaker2: i've had to, well i've changed the shot; we're just a little pressed for time. it'll just be a cu of ellen for the last part of the scene, starting with cora's "i was worried about danny." ok? i'll find a way to cut this into the fourth take. we almost had it. that was unbelievable, both of you. but let's not think about it. that moment is gone, and... we'll, we'll get another one. i have no doubt about it. ok? here we go. nick walks over and stands beside the camera.

speaker1: i'm ready, nick. 
speaker2: call it, wanda.
speaker3: and, roll sound.
speaker4: speed!
speaker3: and, roll camera!
speaker5: rolling!
speaker6: scene six, pickup, take one.
speaker2: action.

speaker1: i was worried about danny. 
speaker2: you do remember.
speaker1: he was smaller than you.
speaker2: you were so worried about danny. what about me, mom? why weren't --

speaker1: what the is that?! sound? 
speaker2: it's not me.
speaker3: it's the camera.
speaker4: the it is. it's off; it's not even running.
speaker1: what's going on down there?! do i have a lock-up?! nothing? you don't hear a beeping sound? the street's quiet.
speaker5: then what the is it!!?
speaker6: it's somebody's watch!
speaker4: not mine.
speaker1: not mine.
speaker2: not mine.
speaker3: not mine.
speaker5: where is it!! you you cock-sucking bastard! where the are you!? where!! where!!
speaker5: can someone help me please?! do i have to do everything myself here?!
speaker5: hey, cora. why don't you go learn your lines! hey scriptgirl, are you finally going to pay attention here?! hey, focus puller, you want to make a movie or get stoned?! huh, i got some great thai stick here! hey wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing i saw your reel, man; it sucked! who the would hire you anyway! hey wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's a little more distracting to my actors! hey bob! hi bob! can you please make a little more noise on the dolly you creaky what is your name!? what do you do around here?! hey speedo, what's the matter? can't even find a teeny beep?!
speaker5: see what i have to put up with, nicole!? maybe next time you'll do some of that magic on camera!? but no, no -- wait till wolf is puking his guts out, "oh now i'll be good!!"

speaker1: well, when did he ask you? 
speaker2: yesterday, when i was helping him check into his hotel.
speaker1: what, the guy can't even check into a hotel by himself?
speaker2: listen, wolf, having chad palomino in this movie will benefit us all. if being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better, then i'm happy to do it.
speaker1: well, how did it come up?
speaker2: he asked me if i liked jazz, i said yes, and he suggested we meet tonight at a jazz club.
speaker1: i like jazz.
speaker2: he did not invite you.
speaker1: why are you wearing perfume to work?
speaker2: because i feel like it.
speaker1: you didn't wear it yesterday.
speaker2: oh, stop it. you're acting like a child.
speaker1: my eye!
speaker2: oh, sweetheart, are you alright?
speaker1: do i look alright?!
speaker2: let me see. christ, we're going to be late.

speaker1: should we call up to the room again? 
speaker2: he said he'd be right down.
speaker2: tired?
speaker1: i'm exhausted. i dreamt i was on the set all night. i was just trying to do one shot and everything kept going wrong.
speaker2: that's an anxiety dream. are you anxious about something?
speaker1: i don't know. sometimes i wonder what the i'm doing in this business. it's all just one compromise and disappointment after another. i don't know if i have the personality for it.
speaker2: sounds kind of like an identity crisis.
speaker1: maybe you're right. who am i? what am i really capable of? maybe i should just get a job teaching at a women's college somewhere.
speaker2: how'd you get into cinematography?
speaker1: i'm not a cinematographer.
speaker2: you're not?
speaker1: no. i'm directing this movie.
speaker2: how'd you get into directing?

speaker1: they're waiting downstairs. 
speaker2: go ahead, i'll take a taxi.
speaker1: oh, ok. listen, i've got to tell you, i had a lot of fun last night, really, but for me, where i'm at right now in my life, a relationship is...
speaker2: chad; hold it. this was a one-time deal. you know it, i know it. there is no need for melodrama.
speaker1: i just thought you might...
speaker2: look, all i ask is that you don't mention this to anyone.
speaker1: hey, that's not my style.
speaker2: good.
speaker1: so, i'll see you on the set.
speaker3: it.

speaker1: i got two films coming up right after yours, nick. one i play a that michelle pfeiffer falls in love with. the other i'm kind of a serial killer who shacks up with winona ryder. 
speaker2: that's great, man.
speaker1: yeah, but i'm not into that hostess nick.
speaker2: hostess twinkie?
speaker1: that hollywood it's all fluff, man. these are the kind of movies i want to do, right here.
speaker2: i'm glad you feel that way, chad. and i just want to tell you, i'm really happy we can work together.
speaker1: hey, me too! you're a great director, man. your films are wacked! and i'm gonna be watching you, buddy. like a hawk. i want to learn from you, nick. i'm gonna pick your brain.
speaker2: good. then you can pick my nose.
speaker1: see what i mean? you're wacked. hey, what are we sitting here for?
speaker2: we're waiting for nicole.
speaker1: nicole? she's takin' a tax --
speaker2: what?
speaker1: probably taking a shower or something. hey, how was her shower scene in that richard gere movie?
speaker2: good.
speaker3: really great.

speaker1: i think we got today. 
speaker2: it just says "scene six: ellen and damian kiss."
speaker1: could be a kiss with nudity.
speaker2: i like ellen. she's my type.
speaker1: why is that?
speaker2: she's pretty. smart. kind of kooky.
speaker1: maybe i'll give her a part. that's right; i'm makin' my own movie pretty soon.
speaker2: oh yeah?
speaker1: yup. feature. i brought my script.
speaker1: palomino's perfect for the lead. i'm going to give it to him right during lunch. maybe right after.
speaker2: alright.
speaker1: got to be aggressive. you want to shoot it?
speaker2: sure.
speaker1: you ever shot anything?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: that's alright; got to start somewhere.

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: shrinking tissue. that's what this stuff is for. let that sit for two minutes, pumpkin; i'll be right back.
speaker1: how'd you get here?
speaker3: took a taxi.
speaker1: oh. we've been waiting in front of your apartment for half an hour.
speaker3: i'm sorry, nick. something came up. i forgot to call. i'm sorry, i feel like such an
speaker1: you're just saying that because you have preparation h on your face.
speaker3: i never should have gone out last night. i hate jazz. i look terrible.
speaker1: no you don't.
speaker3: don't me, nick.
speaker1: i'm not. you really look beautiful.
speaker4: hey! how'd you get here, nicole?
speaker3: i took a cab.
speaker4: oh, cause we were wondering how you got here.
speaker1: alright, good; everybody's here. we'll do a run-through as soon as you guys are ready.
speaker4: you got it, chief.

speaker1: hold it down, hold it down, people. actors working. 
speaker2: great shirt, wanda.
speaker1: why, thank you, chad.
speaker3: ok, let's work out the rest of this blocking. wolf -- what happened to your eye?
speaker4: a little accident.
speaker3: you going to be alright?
speaker4: i think so.
speaker2: it looks good on you, man.
speaker3: nicole is standing here, chad, you're there by the chair. camera is close on ellen: her first line.
speaker5: i've always admired you from afar.
speaker2: admired? that sounds rather professional.
speaker3: good! "professional," that's the cue; damian steps up to the bed. camera pulls back. the scene continues.
speaker5: well, then: loved. how does that sound?
speaker2: it sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker5: i've loved you from the moment we met.
speaker2: why didn't you tell me?
speaker5: we were working together. i didn't want anything to interfere.
speaker2: and all this time i thought...
speaker3: then the kiss. how's that feel?
speaker2: great.
speaker3: nicole?
speaker5: good.
speaker3: wolf, any thoughts?
speaker4: nope.
speaker2: i've got a thought. what about damian having an eyepatch like wolf's?
speaker3: let me think about that one, chad.
speaker2: ok, you're the genius. nick reve, living in oblivion, scene six, take one. let's shoot it!
speaker3: one second, chad. you ready for one, wolf?
speaker4: hell, i been ready.
speaker2: alright, wolfman.
speaker3: good. call it, wanda.
speaker1: going for picture. lock it up. and roll sound.
speaker6: speed!
speaker1: roll camera!
speaker7: rolling!
speaker8: scene six, take one!
speaker3: and, action.

speaker1: i've always admired you from afar. 
speaker2: admired? that sounds rather professional.
speaker1: well, then: loved. how does that sound?
speaker2: it sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker1: i've loved you from the moment we met.
speaker2: why didn't you tell me?
speaker1: we were working together. i didn't want anything to interfere.
speaker2: and all this time i thought...

speaker1: cut. very good. 
speaker2: not for camera. chad was completely out of frame.
speaker1: yeah, chad; what happened, buddy? forget your cue?
speaker3: oh no, man. i held back. it really felt like something damian would do; holding back to the last moment.
speaker1: oh, i see. how's that for you, wolf?
speaker2: i don't care when he moves. just give me a cue.
speaker3: the lone wolf!
speaker1: what line did he move on?
speaker4: "why didn't you tell me?"
speaker1: alright, "me" is the new cue. nicole, how does that feel to you?
speaker5: fine, if that's what chad wants to do.
speaker3: "me, me, me," that's the cue. let's shoot; i'm stoked!
speaker1: one second, chad.
speaker1: chad, how would you describe this scene, in one word?
speaker3: great. it's a great scene, man.
speaker1: no, i mean it's a love scene. right?
speaker3: definitely.
speaker1: these two people really love each other. and we want to see that, especially in the kiss.
speaker3: hey, say no more, chief.
speaker1: nicole?
speaker5: i understand, chief.
speaker1: good. here we go. call it, wanda.
speaker6: going for picture. lock it up. and roll sound.
speaker7: speed!
speaker6: roll camera!
speaker8: rolling!
speaker9: scene six, take two!
speaker1: and, action.

speaker1: i've always admired you from afar. 
speaker2: admired? that sounds rather professional.
speaker1: well, then: loved. how does that sound?
speaker2: it sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker1: i've loved you from the moment we met.
speaker2: why didn't you tell me?
speaker1: we were working together. i didn't want anything to interfere.
speaker2: and all this time i thought...

speaker1: and, cut. very good. wolf? 
speaker2: chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable.
speaker1: yeah, chad. what happened; i thought you were going to hold back till "me"?
speaker3: the more i thought about it the more it didn't seem right. and i'm thinking, watch me here, instead of coming around the bed, what if i just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down?
speaker1: i don't know, that seems a little...
speaker3: hey, i'm just throwing out ideas here. trying to get the juices flowing.
speaker1: nicole, how does that feel to you?
speaker4: well, i can turn to look at him. but won't you be shooting the back of my head?
speaker2: plus chad is completely out of the light down there.
speaker3: hey, wolf; i'm not worried about my face, man. it's about the acting; that's all i care about.
speaker2: it's your call, nick. his acting or his face.
speaker1: for some reason i was hoping we could get both. i thought that's what we were trying to do here.
speaker2: i'll have to set another light.
speaker5: we're ahead of schedule, nick. i think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for mr. palomino.
speaker1: good, let's do it. ellen, damian; let's talk for a second.
speaker5: we'll pause to set this light and go again right away. how long, wolf?
speaker5: wolf?

speaker1: ok, let's make sure we know what's going on here. these two people have loved each other for years, each of them not knowing the other was in love with them. and tonight, in this little room it all comes out. it's like a dam bursting. does that make sense? nicole? 
speaker2: it makes perfect sense. i just haven't found it yet. i'll get it though.
speaker1: what about you, chad?
speaker3: i'm there, man. i got the dam going, the river, everything. you watch, that little change in the blocking is going to open the whole scene up for me.
speaker4: we're ready, nick!
speaker1: good. let's go.

speaker1: going for picture. lock it up. and roll sound. 
speaker2: speed!
speaker1: roll camera!
speaker3: rolling!
speaker4: scene six, take three!
speaker5: and, action.

speaker1: i've always admired you from afar. 
speaker2: admired? that sounds rather professional.
speaker1: well, then: loved. how does that sound?
speaker2: it sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker1: i've loved you from the moment we met.
speaker2: why didn't you tell me?
speaker1: we were working together -- i'm sorry, can we cut, nick?

speaker1: cut! 
speaker2: that's a cut!
speaker3: that was a good one!
speaker4: i know, i'm sorry. but this feels really awkward; turning all the way around like this.
speaker1: yeah, i think the lying on the bed is not quite working, chad. let's try one with the original blocking.
speaker3: which one was that? there's been so many changes. could somebody help me out please?
speaker5: the cue for the original blocking is "professional."
speaker3: thank you. thank you very much.
speaker1: ok, right away. call it, wanda.
speaker4: nick? could i just have a moment? is that alright?
speaker1: of course, nicole; are you kidding? hold the roll, wanda.
speaker2: holding the roll!

speaker1: call it, wanda. 
speaker2: and roll sound.
speaker3: speed!
speaker2: roll camera!
speaker4: rolling!
speaker5: scene six, take four!
speaker6: nick, i just had a great idea!
speaker2: hold the roll!
speaker1: what is it, chad?
speaker6: just stop me if i'm out of line here, but she says "admired from afar," right? doesn't it make sense to see damian up close and her "afar?" you start on a close-up of damian, watch me here; as she declares her love, the camera moves with me into this primo two-shot that you and the wolfmeister have set up here.
speaker1: what do you think, wolf?
speaker7: i don't like it. this is ellen's scene.
speaker1: i don't know; it sort of makes sense.
speaker6: hey, you did it, man. it's all there in the writing.

speaker1: that's ok, no problem. i'm just slapping a little water on my face.
speaker1: so, it's going pretty good, huh?
speaker2: is it? something feels off.
speaker1: yeah, you seem a little tense.
speaker2: do i?
speaker1: but don't worry about it. just take your attention off yourself and put it on chad. work off him a little more.
speaker2: ok, i'll try that.
speaker1: and listen, i know he's no olivier. but he's got something, don't you think? kind of a natural presence.
speaker2: oh yes, he's very natural.
speaker1: so nicole... anything else i can help you with?
speaker2: actually there is. could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth?
speaker1: oh, sure.

speaker1: my eye is killing me. 
speaker2: put your eyepatch on.
speaker1: i lost it.
speaker2: is that little light set yet?
speaker1: that little light was set ten minutes ago.
speaker2: get me the a team in here right away. nick, nicole, and mr. palomino. why didn't you tell me?
speaker1: hey, you're not worried about the time, i'm not worried about the time.
speaker2: oh, i am very worried about the time!
speaker1: i know you are.
speaker2: what is that supposed to mean?
speaker1: what do you think it means?!
speaker2: i don't know what it means!
speaker1: oh yes you do, you know exactly what it means.
speaker2: i have no idea what you're talking about! why are you --
speaker1: you don't understand me, wanda! you have no idea --
speaker2: i don't understand you?!! all i do is take care of you!!!
speaker3: hey, hey, hey! what the hell's going on here?! wanda. this is a very intimate scene and a lot of tension on the set doesn't help. ok? now, wolf, let's just go through the first part of the move. damian, on your new mark. good. close-up, damian; ellen in the background.
speaker3: chad, what are you doing?
speaker1: hey, that's my eyepatch.
speaker4: wolf, could i borrow it? cause i'm telling you, nick; it really feels right. i feel like this guy now, man.
speaker3: i don't know, chad. i don't think it works.
speaker4: you're wrong, man. i'm going to fight you on this one.
speaker1: hey, it's my eyepatch and i don't want anyone wearing it. it's insanitary.
speaker4: fine. i'll get my own. nick, send someone out for an eyepatch. i'll pay for it myself.
speaker3: listen, chad. i didn't want to say this in front of wolf but it makes you look a little... gay.
speaker4: really?
speaker3: yeah, a little bit.
speaker4: 
speaker4: you're right. thanks, buddy. good call.
speaker2: are you ready, nick?
speaker3: one second. you need a rehearsal, wolf?
speaker1: let's just shoot it!!
speaker4: el lobo!
speaker3: call it, wanda.
speaker2: going for picture. lock it up. and roll sound.
speaker5: speed!
speaker2: roll camera!
speaker6: rolling!
speaker7: scene six, take four!
speaker3: and, action.

speaker1: i've always admired you from afar. 
speaker2: admired? that sounds rather professional.
speaker1: well, then: loved. how does that sound?
speaker2: it sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker1: i've loved you from the moment we met.
speaker2: why didn't you tell me?
speaker1: we were working together. i didn't want anything to interfere --

speaker1: cut! 
speaker2: that's a cut. hold the work, going again, right away.
speaker3: i'm sorry, nick. i don't know why i did that. i'm sorry.
speaker4: nick, could i talk to you a second?
speaker2: a momentary delay. everyone stand by. we're going again, right away.
speaker5: excuse me, ellen? you were a tad low on that take.
speaker3: oh, ok. i'll bring it up. actually could i listen to the take before?

speaker1: i'm out of here, man! 
speaker2: what's the matter?!
speaker1: i like you, but i made a big mistake taking this part. have someone call me a cab.
speaker2: wait a second, chad. just talk to me. what's going on!?
speaker1: i can't act with this woman. i know she's a friend of yours but i got to tell you: she cannot act worth a i'm giving her everything! the whole thing i just did with the hair; did you see that? i came up with that on my own because i thought it would help her. but no, she's giving me nothing! i'm out of here.

speaker1: and all this time i thought... 
speaker1: why did you cast her? she sucked in that richard gere movie!
speaker2: you're right. she is not the best actress in the world. i see that now but you've got to help me, chad. i'm asking you to please help me here. we've got to get through this somehow.
speaker1: i'll tell you what this is about, man. you know why she took a cab this morning?
speaker2: something came up.
speaker1: no. she was in my hotel room and she didn't want you to know it. ok? i'm sorry it had to come out like this but i told her this morning "thanks a lot, it was a lot of fun last night but let's get something straight -- it was just a one-time deal," and she didn't want to hear that. she wanted more, you see what i'm saying? it's rejection.

speaker1: nicole, listen... 
speaker2: nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. i apologize. chad, i apologize to you too. i'm completely unfocused here and i think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow.
speaker1: what would you like to do?
speaker2: i was wondering if we could try improvising the scene. more along the lines of what chad has been doing. maybe that would help me find something.
speaker1: that's a fantastic idea. what do you think, chad?
speaker3: hey, that's the only way i can work. let's take it apart, let's cut loose.
speaker1: good! and we'll shoot it! hell, why not?!
speaker3: roll that camera, wolfie!
speaker4: kiss my ass!
speaker3: yeah! let's go!
speaker1: alright, now we're making a movie! call it, wanda!
speaker5: going for picture. lock it up. and roll sound.
speaker6: speed!
speaker5: roll camera!
speaker7: rolling!
speaker8: scene six, take five!
speaker1: and, action.

speaker1: i've always admired you from afar. 
speaker2: have you? that's, wow; that's incredible. but that sounds kind of professional doesn't it? admired?
speaker1: you're right. how does despised sound?
speaker2: great! what's it mean?
speaker2: that sounds like the champagne talking.
speaker1: it's not. i really do think you are a piece of
speaker2: no, you don't. you love me.
speaker1: the i do. i can't stand looking at you!
speaker2: then i guess i have nothing else to say.
speaker1: no, i think you have a lot more to say, damian.
speaker2: well, i am surprised you feel this way, ellen. i always thought you admired --
speaker1: that's not what i meant. you should tell everyone what you just told nick behind the set.
speaker2: hey, this isn't part of the scene.
speaker1: say it anyway: the reason this scene isn't working is because you and i slept together last night. did everyone hear that?! i chad last night!
speaker2: see, nick! i told you this was about rejection!
speaker1: you scumbag! you think i give a rat's about you?! i was there to get laid and even that was a joke!
speaker2: you know, you are really starting to me off!
speaker1: oh, does that mean you're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore, or stroke my hair real soft and concerned, or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of
speaker1: come on! i'll kick your ass! come on!
speaker3: ok, guys, i think we can stop there.
speaker2: you bet your we can stop! wanda, call me a cab!
speaker3: hold on, chad. let's just try to calm down.
speaker2: you. i'm out of here, man. this movie is
speaker3: now wait a second, chad. there's no reason for hostility.
speaker2: shut up, you loser. the only reason i took this part was because someone said you knew quentin tarantino! you're nowhere, man.
speaker3: hey, you want to go? go! i'm sick of your you hostess
speaker2: what'd you call me?
speaker3: you heard me.
speaker2: say it again.
speaker3: you hostess
speaker4: alright, everyone just stop. stop! stop this right now!
speaker5: alright, you've asked for it, chad!
speaker4: wolf!
speaker1: oh,
speaker3: you want to pick my brain?! this is the way i direct hostess scumbags like you!
speaker3: get him out of here! someone take him back to his hotel!
speaker6: chad...
speaker3: are you alright?
speaker1: don't touch me.

speaker1: nicole, i'm sorry. i didn't mean it. you were great in that richard gere movie. 
speaker2: shut up. you're no different than he is. you lie, you're deceitful...
speaker1: i'm not lying. christ, i tell everyone how great you are. i've got nothing but respect and admiration for you.
speaker2: oh now you're doing your own script.
speaker1: well, why do you think i wrote it?!
speaker2: i have no idea!
speaker1: it's about you. it's about how i feel about you.
speaker2: christ, did you get a bump on your head, nicky. 'cause you're talking like an
speaker1: nicole. i've loved you since the day we met.
speaker2: why didn't you tell me?
speaker1: i didn't want anything to get in the way of us working together.
speaker2: and all this time i thought...

speaker1: oh, 
speaker2: don't go out that door!

speaker1: why not? 
speaker2: it's part of the set, goddamnit. now go around.
speaker1: next time. this is an emergency.
speaker2: has ellen showed up yet?
speaker3: ssss... kkkkkrrk.
speaker2: get her into wardrobe right away.
speaker3: ssskk... ssssrrrk?
speaker2: no! scene six; scene five has been postponed. i'm not going to say it again; mr. palomino is not working today. now where is that smoke machine!

speaker1: oh. sorry. 
speaker2: what do you want?!
speaker1: i need to use the bathroom. kind of an emergency.
speaker2: well, knock!!
speaker2: i swear to christ, one of these days i'm going to punch somebody in the balls!

speaker1: just as we pull up to your apartment palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he can't work today. 
speaker2: was it something he ate?
speaker3: stand up, please.
speaker1: i don't know.
speaker2: can he work tomorrow?
speaker3: turn around, please.
speaker1: don't know that either. but i'm not worrying about it. i had this dream last night where i was on the set. you were in it, and another woman, someone older. anyway, everything was going wrong. the harder i tried to hold things together the more they fell apart. and you know what that dream was telling me, nicole? you just got to roll with it. and that's what i'm doing, i'm rolling with it. so, we'll just shoot the dream sequence today.
speaker1: hey, tito. you look great, man.

speaker4: tito.
speaker2: oh, i'm sorry.
speaker1: listen, if there's anything i can do to make you... if you need... uh, just let me know.
speaker4: put a stool in the bathroom.
speaker1: did i just offend him?
speaker2: what did you say?
speaker1: "short notice?"
speaker2: come on; that was nothing. i'm the one who called him "toto." i'm out of it. i dreamt i was on the set last night too.
speaker1: oh yeah?
speaker2: yeah. you were in the dream.
speaker1: was i freaking out?
speaker2: actually, you were.
speaker1: that's great: i freak out in my dream; i freak out in your dream. no wonder i'm exhausted.
speaker2: nick...
speaker1: yeah?

speaker1: alright, guys; special effects today. could be fun. who knows how to work this baby? 
speaker2: it's the old t-160. i used it once in '85.
speaker3: '85.
speaker1: what's this?
speaker2: that's where the gas goes.
speaker4: no, that's where the oil goes.
speaker2: is it?
speaker4: i think so.
speaker2: you're right. it's coming back now.
speaker1: i'm going to let you handle this one, bob. this is your baby. and les, if he needs help you give him a hand. ok, guys? we're all working together today.

speaker1: scene thirty-one?! i left my notes for scene thirty-one at home! i didn't know we were --
speaker2: nick, nick. i'll send someone to your apartment to pick them up. now, relax.
speaker1: oh, ok. send somebody to my apartment to pick them up; it's the red notebook, under the bed.
speaker2: it's taken care of, nick.
speaker1: good. great. good.
speaker3: we're all lit, the smoke machine is under control; we're ready to go.
speaker2: what about the dolly?
speaker3: just need to see a run-through and we're all set. i'm going to make your job easy today, wanda. wandaful. mmm, i'm glad you wore that perfume. and don't worry about palomino; i'll take you to a jazz club tonight.
speaker2: oh, i can't make it. i have to go see chad; he's extremely ill.
speaker3: oh, by the way my eye's much better.
speaker2: listen, wolf, this may not be the best time to say this but our relationship is going nowhere.
speaker3: what do you mean?
speaker2: please, don't take it personally. because i care for you, wolf, i really do. but i've had this feeling for quite a while and i think it's time we ended it. ok?

speaker1: i think it's better. 
speaker2: so do i.
speaker1: well, good. still friends?
speaker2: sure.
speaker1: great, cause we still have to work together and there's no reason it has to be unpleasant. give me a hug.
speaker1: you're a real special guy, wolf.
speaker2: thanks.
speaker1: ok, let's get the a team in please! nick, ellen, mr. tito!

speaker1: ok, here's the shot. we start wide with ellen standing absolutely still right in the middle of the frame. you got that, wolf? 
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: what happened to your eye?
speaker2: nothing. it's a little sensitive today.
speaker1: can you see?
speaker2: of course i can see!
speaker1: ok, ellen is standing there. the smoke is flowing in and: ellen's line.
speaker3: i am so hungry.
speaker1: good, tito, that's your cue.
speaker1: you walk around her once, hold the apple out, that's right; just beyond her reach. you're staring at her hard. harder, good. then stop right here. can we get a mark, please?
speaker1: then we dolly in to tito's close-up. alright, wolf?
speaker4: it should be hand-held.
speaker1: no, i think it's better on the dolly.
speaker2: whatever.
speaker3: nick, do i see him?
speaker1: no, just the apple. and tito, right after we dolly in give me a little laugh there.
speaker5: a little laugh?
speaker1: big, little; anything you feel like doing. ok? good. let's shoot one. call it, wanda.
speaker4: ok, here we go. camera back to one. action on the smoke.
speaker4: and roll sound.
speaker1: hold it, wanda. can we get a little more smoke? is that possible?
speaker6: oh, sure.
speaker1: good. call it, wanda.
speaker4: going for picture. lock it up. and roll sound.
speaker7: speed!
speaker4: roll camera!
speaker8: rolling!
speaker9: scene six, take one!
speaker1: and, action.

speaker1: and... cut. 
speaker2: that's a cut. nick; comments?
speaker1: yeah, just a couple. i thought that was uh... good. tito, that was very good, man, really. you didn't feel like laughing?
speaker3: i laughed.
speaker1: oh, ok; i guess i missed it. you could make it bigger if you want. and ellen, maybe just a little more tension when you see him.
speaker4: i thought i didn't see him.
speaker1: right, maybe you see him a little bit.
speaker4: alright, i'm confused. do i see him or not?
speaker1: you see him.
speaker4: ok, what is the tension? who is toto?
speaker3: it's tito.
speaker4: what did i say?
speaker3: toto.
speaker4: oh, i'm sorry, tito. i don't know why i'm doing that. i'm really sorry.
speaker1: ellen, come on now; concentrate. remember; you're marrying damian tomorrow. you're a little anxious. you have this dream. let's call it an anxiety dream, and tito represents the anxiety.
speaker1: ok? it seems pretty simple.
speaker4: let's just try it.
speaker1: good. and bob, let's really have some smoke on this one.
speaker5: ok, more smoke.
speaker6: i still think it should be hand-held.
speaker1: yeah, well, i don't want it hand- held. i want it on the dolly. where's my notebook, wanda?
speaker2: on it's way, nick.
speaker1: good. call it, wanda.
speaker2: lock it up. going for picture. and roll sound.
speaker7: speed!
speaker2: roll camera!
speaker8: rolling!
speaker9: scene six, take two!
speaker1: and, action.

speaker1: cut. 
speaker2: that's a cut. going again, nick?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: going again, please stand by.
speaker1: ok, ellen, good. you're on to something there.
speaker3: no, something's not right. it all feels fake to me.
speaker1: well, it's not fake; it's real. just remember, you really want the apple. tito, i still think we could see more of a laugh at the end.
speaker4: what kind of laugh?
speaker1: just a laugh.
speaker4: show me.
speaker1: oh, ok. a laugh. i'm thinking maybe like this. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
speaker1: something like that. ok? and remember, tito, this is a dream. not everything has to make sense. a laugh right there heightens our sense of... of...
speaker4: anxiety.
speaker1: exactly. wolf, how was that for you?
speaker5: i still think it should be hand-held.
speaker1: and bob, what the is that smoke? might as well get a couple hamsters in here blowing smoke rings for christ's sake.
speaker6: the septic valve wasn't open. i got it now. we're going to see some smoke now.
speaker1: alright, let's try another take.
speaker2: and, lock it up.
speaker5: nick, could i talk to you for a minute?
speaker1: what?!
speaker5: in private.
speaker1: alright.
speaker2: release the lock-up. everyone stand by.
speaker6: we'll see some smoke now.
speaker7: way to go, bob.

speaker1: i really don't like being spoken to like that, nick! 
speaker2: yeah, well i don't like your attitude!
speaker1: i don't have an attitude!
speaker2: the you don't! every time i ask you to do something all i get is no, no, no and i'm sick of it! i hired you to do a job; if you're not going to do it you better let me know right now!
speaker1: i'm sorry, nick. i'm going through some heavy
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: i can't really go into it. it's pretty heavy.
speaker2: personal?
speaker1: personal, professional, emotional. it's doing a number on me. and now you're telling me you're going to fire me.
speaker2: i didn't say that, wolf. come on, i'm not going to fire you. you're doing a great job here.
speaker1: am i?
speaker2: yeah, i don't know what i'd do without you, man. you've got a great eye. i just hope it's not the one under that eyepatch.
speaker2: listen, wolf. let me tell you one thing i've learned; sometimes you just have to roll with things. you know?
speaker1: you're right.
speaker2: roll with it, man. you'll be ok.
speaker1: thanks, bro.

speaker1: that's where the oil goes. 
speaker2: no, that's where the gas goes.
speaker1: i'm tellin' you, bob. that's where the oil goes.
speaker3: lester, don't you think bob knows where the oil goes?!
speaker2: i don't remember using oil in '85.
speaker4: maybe both the oil and gas go in there?
speaker1: i think he's right.
speaker2: i think he is too. ok, three parts gas, one part oil.
speaker5: is my notebook here yet, wanda?
speaker6: any minute, nick.
speaker5: good. call it, wanda.
speaker6: going for picture. lock it up. and roll sound.
speaker3: speed!
speaker6: roll camera!
speaker4: rolling!
speaker7: scene six, take three!
speaker5: and, action.

speaker1: cut! cut! cut! 
speaker2: turn it off! turn it off!
speaker3: i can't find the switch!
speaker4: pull the plug! bob! pull the plug!
speaker2: open the door! get some water!
speaker3: i got it! i got it!
speaker2: clear the set! ellen! tito! please step off the set!
speaker5: i'm off the set!
speaker6: so am i.
speaker2: then who is that? who is that? please step off the set!
speaker7: hi, nicky.
speaker1: mom!

speaker1: cora reve, r-e-v-e. blue housecoat, blue slippers. how do i know? because she's sitting ten feet away from me. well sweetheart, that's going to be a real problem. 
speaker2: she was waiting outside nick's apartment when i went to pick up his notebook. she said she was looking for him so i figured i should just bring her up here. you look really pretty in that dress.

speaker1: how did you get here? 
speaker2: i took a bus in; went right to your apartment.
speaker1: how did you get out of your room?
speaker2: oh, i just went right through the door.
speaker1: it was unlocked!?
speaker2: no, it was locked. i just went through it. it's something i've learned to do, nicky. i can walk through just about anything; like air.
speaker1: mom, you've got to stop doing this. i'm serious. i'm a little upset with you. you could have gotten lost, or hurt.
speaker2: i wanted to see you. i've missed you.
speaker1: i know, mom; i've missed you too. but it's not really a good time.
speaker3: they're sending a car. it should be here in a couple of hours. they didn't even know she was gone.
speaker1: i don't believe this.
speaker2: i'm sorry, nick. if i knew there was going to be a wedding i would have worn my hat.

speaker1: there. how's that, mom? can you see? 
speaker2: is the little fellow going to do gymnastics?
speaker1: shhhh! no. now come on, mom. you've got to be quiet. absolutely quiet.

speaker1: how are you doing? 
speaker2: good; real good.
speaker3: how's the smoke machine?
speaker1: it's dead, nick. i've got calls out to every effects house in the city but i just can't seem to locate --
speaker3: forget it. we'll shoot without it.
speaker1: but nick, it's a dream sequence.
speaker3: that's the way it goes, wanda. we're just going to have to roll with it. nothing else we can do. we've got to roll with it, right, wolf?
speaker3: ok, here we go. ellen, you've got to keep reaching for that apple. i don't feel that you really want it. i mean, christ, how many times do i have to tell you!
speaker1: everyone stand by. nobody move. going again, right away.

speaker1: alright, nicole. what's the matter? 
speaker2: you tell me! you're the one with the bug up your ass!
speaker1: now wait just a second!
speaker2: you've been picking on me all day! i can't do anything right!
speaker1: i'm sorry if i was short with you, nicole, but i think you can see i'm under a little pressure here. i'm shooting a dream sequence without a smoke machine, my mother's out there thinking she's at a circus wedding and you tell me the whole movie seems fake!
speaker2: i never said that!
speaker1: you did too. you said, "everything feels fake."
speaker2: i meant me! i feel fake! everything i'm doing feels fake. i can't act. i should just do shower scenes in richard gere movies for the rest of my life!
speaker1: nicole, that's ridiculous. you're a fantastic actress. all you have to do is show me you want that apple more than anything else in the world; don't give up. understand? you cannot give up.

speaker1: suddenly wanda yells out. 
speaker2: ready, nick?!
speaker3: ready!
speaker3: ok, here we go. everybody focus, concentrate. and tito, we're still looking for that little laugh, pal. ok? call it, wanda!
speaker2: picture's up. there will be no smoke in this scene. no smoke. no smoke in the dream sequence. and roll sound.
speaker4: speed!
speaker2: roll camera!
speaker5: rolling!
speaker6: scene six, take four!
speaker3: and, action.
speaker7: i am so hungry.
speaker8: oh, i thought this was the tv room.

speaker1: cut! 
speaker2: that's a cut. going again, right away.
speaker1: mom, listen to me. i don't want you to move from this chair. do you understand?
speaker3: oh you sound just like your father...
speaker1: mom, i'm serious.
speaker3: ok, ok. i won't move.
speaker1: thank you.

speaker1: ok, good. very good. tito, i think we're having a little communication problem here. all i want you to do is laugh. ok? 
speaker2: why?
speaker1: i told you why.
speaker2: tell me again.

speaker1: look, tito. it's not that big a deal. it's a dream, alright. strange things happen in a dream. all you have to do is laugh. why is that such a problem? 
speaker2: why does it have to be a dwarf?
speaker1: what?
speaker2: why does my character have to be a dwarf?
speaker1: he doesn't have to be a dwarf.
speaker2: then why is he?! is that the only way you can make this a dream; put a dwarf in it?
speaker1: no, tito; that's not --
speaker2: have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it?! do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? no! i don't even have dreams with dwarves in them! the only place i've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this! make it weird; put a dwarf in it. everyone will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a dream, there's a dwarf in it!" well, i'm sick of it. you can take this dream sequence and shove it up your ass! tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks
speaker3: nick? i can get right on the phone. we'll try to get another... small person here as soon as possible.
speaker1: no. he's absolutely right.
speaker4: you want to just shoot ellen, nick? she could be in the dream by herself.
speaker1: no. we're not going to shoot anything. i'm sorry. thanks for all your help, but it's over. i can't take it anymore. i tried to roll with it but it's time to face the music; i can't do this. i am not a director. the shoot is over. i give up.
speaker4: take the camera off the dolly. start putting it away.
speaker5: give me that apple!
speaker5: i'm ready, nick!

speaker1: roll camera. roll sound. let's go. right away. 
speaker2: i am so hungry.

speaker1: and cut!! 
speaker1: wolf, talk to me, man! did you get it?
speaker2: got it, nick! everything!
speaker1: the close-up?
speaker2: perfect. see? that's what i meant about going hand-held!
speaker1: you're a genius, man! what about the focus?!
speaker3: nailed it.
speaker2: a!
speaker4: going again, nick?
speaker1: how was the sound?
speaker5: i could use another but definitely acceptable.
speaker1: mom, you kook! that was incredible! did you know we were filming?
speaker6: of course i knew you were filming.
speaker1: you were great, you're a natural. and nicole, that was beautiful. don't you dare tell me that felt fake.
speaker4: going again, nick?
speaker1: oh, hold on. let me think a second.
speaker1: can i use it for the dream sequence, that's the question. does it work for the dream sequence?
speaker1: we're going with it, wanda!
speaker4: alright everyone, listen up. that is a wrap on scene six.
speaker5: hold it! hold it! hold it!
speaker4: what?!
speaker5: i need to record room tone. i'll need thirty seconds of silence.
speaker4: oh, alright! quiet. quiet! shut up!! thirty seconds of room tone. the sooner you're quiet the sooner we're done.
speaker6: what's room tone?
speaker1: it's for the sound, mom. we just have to be quiet.
speaker4: and roll sound. nobody move.
speaker5: speed.

speaker1: had any experience? 
speaker2: i was an actress for a while.
speaker1: yeah, but can you cook a hamburger?
speaker2: probably.

speaker1: what i love about you, chad, is you're not afraid of my power. 
speaker2: oh wanda! i love your power. it's like an afferdesiac to me!
