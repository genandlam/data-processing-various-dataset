GINGER: now i'll do you.
BRIGITTE: we do everything together. but, at fifteen? a chick can change. ya know?

BRIGITTE: don't get me wrong. it's not like we were all happy or nothin' to begin with. 
BRIGITTE: the suburb of bailey downs? basically a well lit black hole. the kingdom of cul du sac. that's french for dead end.

BRIGITTE: you had a gram of personality out here? life bit the big one. 
BRIGITTE: of course i'm generalizing.
BRIGITTE: no i'm not.
GINGER: the bee. take a picture already.

BRIGITTE: we were always considered freaks. for as long as i can remember, there was us. and there was them. like from kindergarten. 
ART TEACHER: very -um. class? comments?
ART TEACHER: brigitte. what does it mean for you?
GINGER: means there's more to life than -- well, li.fe.
BRIGITTE: attempts at communication wore futile.
BRIGITTE: some of them did seem to wanna reach ginger?
BRIGITTE: but nobody wanned to reach me.
BRIGITTE: like i cared.

GINGER: gawd, people! they hurt my brain! 
BRIGITTE: they didn't even get it.

GINGER: they're leems.
BRIGITTE: they're the walkin'-/
BR I G ITTE: another one?

8: ginger offers her a sucker and has one herself. 
GINGER: no pe .
JASON: see? she's weird, but hot.
TIM: anybody poled fitzy yet?
TIM: not that one. the cute one.
GINGER: sad. must be hard to think with yer brains slappin' around yer thighs like that all day.
BRIGITTE: we didn't do guys. guys were too gross. everyone at bailey high was just too incredibly gross.

BRIGITTE: the only thing worse than most teenage boys are most teenage girls. trinas are the limit. 
GINGER: i feel sick.
BRIGITTE: me too.
GINGER: no, j. mean really.
BRI.GITTE: there was really only one trina, but they were all the same.
TRINA: ooops. sorry.

GINGER: y' okay's 
BRIGITTE: i hate her. like to feed her ground glass with tacks for desert. then make her puke it back up and swallow it again until she's like shredded to a bazillion pieces from the inside out...
BRIGITTE,: what's the matter?
GINGER: i got gas...maybe i'll try an, cut one right in her face out there.

BRIGITTE: after two weeks a' high school., ya come to the conclusion it's all about agony. take phys. ed, sus' practise takin' pain. 
SYKES: field lacrosse is no pussy-assed tea party, ya get in there, get a lock on your target and push it! i want sweat i want action!

MZ.SYKES: shake a leg, fitzgeralds. an, out, you gotta death wish!? 
GINGER: feel really sick, mz. sykes.
MZ. SYRES: cigarettes'll do that for you! move!
BRIGITTE: phys. ed. is not optional at bailey high.
BRIGITTE: i been waiting for this. there'd been a lot of dead dogs around lately, but this was my personal first.
TRINA: oh, how gro-o-o-o-oss!!

BRIGITTE: 'kay, here's the weird thing about me. i dig dead stuff. live things make me sick, they're all warm and snotty and and pissy. and live things jus' suffer, which i can't take. but a dead thing? s'kinda beautiful, 'cause a dead thing's really i dunno -like, free. 
SYKES: don't touch it, fitzgerald! what's wrong with you two?!
TRINAS IN CHORUS: the cult? drains the blood out and drinks it, ya know! /1 heard they have with them first !
BRIGITTE: everyone was all like, oh it's a teen cult, or aah, it's some looney, the beast a' bailey downs. what crap.
SYKES: all right, ladies, settle! this is no joke! you have information about the dog deaths you do

CLASS IN CHORUS: tell a teacher, principal fardor, or the police. 
BRIGITTE: teen cult my ass. look ginge', something went for its throat - it's not cut, it's chewed...

BRIGITTE: ginger? 
BRIGITTE: ginger's no pussy. she doesn't faint. i might faint. like, if this pooch were only half-dead, i could faint.

FERRY: the fainting' s worrisome you don't diet do you dear? 
GINGER: no.
FERRY: hm. anemia's very common at your age. eat more red meat, try an iron vitamin supplement. if it happens again, straight to a proper doctor, all righty?
FERRY: now as for 'the headache, cramps, lower back pain .i'm guessing your period is due.
GINGER: i haven't got a, um, period.
FERRY: never? flow old are you?
GINGER: fifteen. our mother says we're late bloomers.

FERRY: well judging by your troubles, i'd say you can expect to blossom any time now! 
FERRY: are you familiar with all these?
FERRY: now what suits one girl might not be comfortable for another. the proper form of protection is a personal choice, and may have a lot to do with your menstrual flow, which naturally changes during the time you'll have your little miracle of nature. it could start thick and syrupy, move to a straight-forward basic bright red bleeding and then perhaps a deep brownish to blackish slime, signaling the end of the flow. twenty-eight days later or there abouts, it'll start all over again and continue every month until menopause, in about thirty years' time.
FERRY: here's a little calendar to keep track, count from the day it starts twenty-eight days. that'll be your next time. you have any questions, come see me again. you too sweetheart, be your turn shortly, i expect.

BRIGITTE: here's a dirty word. inevitability. that fate fully intended us to be typical in any way, sooner or later, was so insulting. 
BRIGITTE: "some days it's all you need."-?
GINGER: so you pulled a quincy on that dog, unh?
BRIGITTE: hunh?
GINGER: quincy, that guy with the stiffs on cable. alls i remember is you goin', "teen cult my ass".
BRIGITTE: oh. right. well, i dunno.
GINGER: why are you looking at me like that? do i look - different?
BRIGITTE: no.
GINGER: can you tell i'm going to-?
BRIGITTE: no. .really.

GINGER: hey. if i start simpin' around tampon dispensers and moanin' over cramps, or even think about buying somethin' that says baby powder fresh? you'll. shoot me, right? br tg.'i"i'l of course. 
GINGER: out by sixteen
BRIGITTE: .or dead in this scene.
BRIGITTE: if we failed to get a life by ginger's sixteenth birthday? we were s'posed to gas ourselves in the garage. for smart girls, we could be pretty dumb. we prob'ly never woulda done it, but we seemed to need a deadline.

HENRY: how was school today? 
GINGER: fine.
BRIGITTE: the nicest thing i could say about henry and pamela was also the meanest thing i could say.
PAMELA: didn't you have a presentation?
GINGER: fine.
BRIGITTE: they were easily satisfied.
PAMELA: made an appointment for you girls at my gynecologist. next thursday.
GINGER: why.
PAMELA: you know why.
GINGER: we're not going to a gynecologist.
PAMELA: what did i say about that tone of voice? .you are going to the gynecologist.

GINGER: dad!? she's completely paranoid! 
HENRY: i'd rather stay out of this.
GINGER: she's gonna have some fat jerk get his jollies poking his fingers up our ./
HENRY: i'm actually eating here.
PAMELA: henry, neither one of them has had a period yet.
HENRY: ah. yes. you've said. repeatedly.
PAMELA: it's very odd that two perfectly healthy fifteen year olds are not menstruating. right?
HENRY: mmmm. steak's really yummy tonight. this a new sauce?
PAMELA: i started at eleven. the problem must be on your side, henry.
HENRY: pamela? this is not my fault. no one's at fault here.
PAMELA: when did your sister start?

HENRY: i've told you, i really have no idea. oddly enough, we never discussed it. why don't you call her and ask her yourself? 
PAMELA: i can't call her out of the blue and ask a thing like that. besides, it's dinner time.
HENRY: a--ha!
PAMELA: well i've been checking for four years now
GINGER and BRIGITTE/HENRY: mo-othe-er!!! /for chrissakes.
GINGER: you look at our underwear?
HENRY: hey, hey - i don't want to hear that word in my house. you will do as your mother says and i will change the subject. anybody going to tell me what happened to my fence?
BRIGITTE: why din't you jus' tell her you're going to get it?

GINGER: can't take her 'attention'. she grosses me out. can't believe she's our mother. 
BRIGITTE: yeah, but now we have to see this doctor. you can jus' say you got it, but i'm screwed.
