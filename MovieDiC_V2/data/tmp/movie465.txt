RALPH: well brad, i guess we made it huh! 
BRAD: well i don't think there was any doubt about that - you and betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on dr scott's refresher lectures.
RALPH: tell you the truth brad, she was the only reason i came in the first place. science was never one of my favourite subjects but i sure with dr scott could have made it today.

NARRATOR: i would like if i may to take you on a strange journey. 
NARRATOR: it seemed a fairly ordinary night when brad majors and his fiancee janet weiss left denton that late november evening to visit dr everett scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them. it's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving. it's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air. but they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening. on a night out. he closes the book marking the place.
NARRATOR: it was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time.

JANET: gosh. that's the third motorcyclist that's passed us. they certainly take their lives in their hands. what with the weather and all. 
BRAD: yes, janet. life's pretty cheap to that type. janet takes another stick of gum. offers brad some. he declines.
JANET: what's the matter brad, darling?
BRAD: i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
JANET: oh dear! but then where did the motorcyclists come from?
BRAD: hmmm ... well, i guess we will have to turn back.

JANET: what was that bang? 
BRAD: we must have a blow-out.
JANET: oh...

BRAD: you'd better sit here and keep warm while i go for help. 
JANET: but where will you go? we're in the middle of nowhere.
BRAD: didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles? maybe they have a telephone i might use.
JANET: i'm coming with you.
BRAD: there's no point both of us getting wet.
JANET: i'm coming with you. besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back. brad laughs. a thunderclap.

JANET: in the velvet darkness of the blackest night burning bright. 
JANET: there's a guiding star
BRAD and JANET: there's a light the castle looms in the distance.
PHANTOM VOICES: over at the frankenstein place.

RIFF RAFF: i think you had better both come inside. 
JANET: you're too kind.

JANET: oh brad, i'm frightened. what kind of place is this? 
BRAD: oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

RIFF RAFF: this way. 
JANET: are you - giving a party?
RIFF RAFF: no. you've arrived on a rather special night. it's one of the master's affairs.

RIFF RAFF: i remember doing the time warp.
RIFF RAFF: drinking those moments when the blackness would hit me. magenta half closes her eyes in pleasure.
RIFF RAFF: and the void would be calling.

JANET: then ask the butler - or someone.
BRAD: let's wait awhile janet. we don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
JANET: this isn't the junior chamber of commerce brad.
BRAD: they're probably foreigners with ways different from our own. - they may do some more folk dancing.
JANET: brad - i'm cold, i'm wet, and plain scared.
BRAD: i'm here, there's nothing to worry about. guests rise, staring mesmerised at the lift.

FRANK: don't get strung out by the way that i look. 
FRANK: don't judge a book by its cover i'm not much of a man by the light of day but by night i'm one of a lover. janet gives a silent scream.
FRANK: i'm just a sweet transvestite from transexual transylvania.
BRAD: i'm glad we caught you at home ah - could we use your phone we're both in a bit of a hurry.

BRAD: ah, hi. my name is brad majors and this is my fiancee, janet weiss. you are ...

BRAD: people like you maybe
COLUMBIA: i've seen it.
JANET: it he - frank - is he your husband?
RIFF RAFF: the master is not yet married. nor do i think he ever will be. we are simply his servants.

FRANK: tonight...one, one, one. can you hear me at the back? tonight, my unconventional conventionists.
FRANK: tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in biochemical research.
FRANK: and paradise is to be mine.
FRANK: it was strange the way it happened. one of those quirks of fate really. one of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost: you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall. there's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break. all the pieces seem to fit into place. what a sucker you'r been. what a fool. the answer was there all the time. it took a small accident to make it happen. an accident!
FRANK: that's how i discovered the secret. that elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life. guests applaud. frank you see, brad and janet, you are fortunate. for tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be born.

FRANK: throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator. 
FRANK: and step up the reactor power input three more points.
JANET: brad...
BRAD: it's alright janet.

ROCKY: the sword of damocles is hanging over my head.

74A	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT: song: charles atlas
FRANK: a weakling weighing ninety eight pounds will get sand in his face when kicked to the ground. and soon in the gym with a determined chin the sweat from his pores as he works for his ca-ha-hause magenta and riff raff now bring the weights.
FRANK: will make him glisten - thank you - and gleam. and with massage and just a little bit of ste-he-he-he-hem... he'll be pink.
FRANK: he'll be a strong man - oh honey -
FRANK: he'll eat nutritious high protein and swallow raw eggs. try to build up his shoulders, his chest, arms and legs. such an effort - if he only knew of my plan.
FRANK: he'll do press-ups and chin-ups, do the snatch, clean and jerk. frank crosses to janet and brad he thinks dynamic tension must be hard work. such strenuous living i just don't understand.

COLUMBIA: eddie! 
EDDIE: stay cool baby.
JANET: who's eddie?
RIFF RAFF: the delivery boy.
MAGENTA: his delivery wasn't good enough though. rocky looks terrified. janet has fainted yet again.

EDDIE: whatever happened to saturday night when you dressed up sharp and you felt alright it don't seem the same since cosmic light came into my life and i thought i was divine. columbia leaps on to the pillion seat. i used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go and listen to the music on the radio. the motorcyclists guests remember only too well. a saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show and we climbed in the back and we really had a good time 
ALL: hot patootie bless my soul i really love that rock and roll
EDDIE: my head used to swim from the perfume i smelled. my hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt. i'd taster her baby pink lipstick, and that's when i'd melt. and she'd whisper in my ear, tonight she really was mine. get back in front and put some hair oil on. buddy holly was singing his very last song. with your arms around your girl you tried to - ah - sing along it felt pretty good, whoo. really had a good ti-i-ime.

NARRATOR: there are some people who say that life is an illusion, and that reality is simply a figment of our imaginations! if this is so, then brad and janet are quite safe. however, the sudden departure of their host and his creation had left them feeling both apprehensive and uneasy. a feeling which grew as the other guests 'departed' and 'they' were shown to their separate rooms. 
WIPE TO: janet looks lost.

82	INT.	BRAD'S ROOM 	NIGHT: brad looks lost.

BRAD: you promise you won't tell?

BRAD: once in a while she don't want to call you speaking on the telephone once in your life she won't want to know you you look around the one you've found she is gone. 
WIPE TO: janet is sitting on the end of the bed.
JANET: i'm engaged to brad just the same as betty monroe was to ralph hapschatt. but frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy i've never dreamt of before.

BRAD: and that's all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone you'd thought you'd known. 
WIPE TO: janet is at the door.
JANET: i could see brad's face before me and my mind screamed no! but my lips were hungry - too hungry.

JANET: yes. there you see it's instinctive. this room is your womb. you returned here for one thing - security. 
JANET: oh brad! what have they done with him?

JANET: ahhh! rocky smiles helplessly. 
JANET: oh brad. how could you? oh, but you're hurt. did they do this to you?

JANET: i thought there's no use getting into heavy petting. she rips off another piece of her petticoat. it only leads to trouble and seat wetting. 
JANET: now all i want to know is how to go i've tasted blood and i want more i'll put up no resistance i want to stay the distance i've got an itch to scratch and i need assistance.
JANET: touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me. i wanna be dirty. thrill me, chill me, fulfil me. creature of the night. then if anything grows while you pose, i'll oil you up and rub you down

FRANK: y'got a block, take my advice. you'd better wise up, janet weiss. 
FRANK: the transducer will seduce yah.
JANET: my feet - i can' move my feet.
DR. SCOTT: my wheels - my i can't move my wheels.
BRAD: it's as if we were glued to the spot.
FRANK: you are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
JANET: we're trapped. frank it's something you'll get used to. a mental mind can be nice.
JANET: oh! frank climbs up the ladder beside the tank.
DR. SCOTT: you won't find earth people quite the easy mark you imagine. this sonic transducer - it is, i suppose, some kind of audio-vibratory, physiomolecular transport device....
BRAD: you mean...
DR. SCOTT: yes brad. it's something we ourselves have been working on. but it seems our friend here has found a way of perfecting it. a device which is capable of breaking down solid matter and then projecting it through space, and - who knows - perhaps even time itself!
JANET: you mean he's gonna send us to another planet?
FRANK: planet. schmanet. janet.
FRANK: you'd better wise up, janet weiss. you'd better wise up, build your thighs up.

SONG:		"HOT DOG": janet screams out. 
JANET: sto-o-o-o-o-op.
BRAD: you're a hot dog but you'd better not try to hurt her, frank furter. frank signals to magenta. bcs magenta's hand on the transducer switch.
DR. SCOTT: you're a hot dog but you'd better not try to hurt her, frank furter.
JANET: you're a hot dog... frank signals. c.s. switch.

COLUMBIA: my i can't take any more of this - first you spurn me for eddie, then you cast him off like an old overcoat for rocky. you chew people up and then spit them out - i loved you, do you hear me - i loved you - and what did it get me - i'll tell you - a big nothing. you're like a sponge. you take, take, take, take! you drain others of their love and emotions. well, i've had enough. you've got to choose between me and rocky - so named because of the rocks in his head. frank throws a switch, she turns to stone. 
FRANK: it's not easy having a good time. he crosses over to riff raff and magenta even smiling makes my face ache. riff raff and magenta nod sympathetically. he lies on the operating table.
FRANK: my children turn on me. rocky's behaving just as eddie did. maybe i made a mistake in splitting his brain between the two of them.
MAGENTA: when will we return to transylvania?
FRANK: magenta, i am indeed grateful to both you and your brother riff raff - you have both served me well - loyalty such as yours must be rewarded and you will discover when the mood takes me i can be quite generous.
MAGENTA: i ask for nothing, master.
FRANK: and you shall receive it - in abundance. come. we are ready for the floor show. our guests will be growing restless. the lift moves downwards.

NARRATOR: and so, by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that brad and janet should keep that appointment with their friend dr everett scott. but it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen. and just a few hours after announcing their engagement, brad and janet had both tasted forbidden fruit. this in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion. what further indignities were they to be subjected to? and what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of? what indeed? from what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic. 
WIPE TO: 149 int. ballroom night

155	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT: columbia's statue comes to life. 
COLUMBIA: it was great when it all began i was a regular frank fan. but it was over when he had the plan to start working on a muscle-man. now the only thing that gives me hope is my love of a certain dope rose tints my world keeps me safe from my trouble and pain.

FRANK: give yourself over to absolutely pleasure swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh nightmares beyond any measure and sensual daydreams to treasure forever. frank enters the pool. can't you just see it. can't you just see it. they begin to immerse themselves in the pool. 161a don't dream it. be it. 
ALL: don't dream it. be it. dr scott animates belatedly.
DR. SCOTT: ach, we've got to get out of this trap before this decadence saps our wills. i've got to be strong and try to hang on. or else my mind, may well snap.
DR. SCOTT: und my life will be lived, for the thri-i-i-i-ill...
BRAD: it's beyond me help me mo-ommy. he is pulled back into the pool.
JANET: bless lilly saint cyr.

FRANK: my my my my 
ALL: i'm a wild and an untamed thing i'm a bee with a deadly sting. get a hit and your mind goes ping

RIFF RAFF: frank n. furter it's all over your mission is a failure. frank looks stunned. your life style's too extreme. frank is guilt-stricken. i'm your new commander. you are now my prisoner. the guests scramble for the safety of the wings. we return to transylvania prepare the transit beam.

MAGENTA: how sentimental. 
RIFF RAFF: and also presumptuous of you. you see when i said "we" were to return to transylvania, i referred only to magenta and myself. frank looks appalled.
RIFF RAFF: you see, you are to remain here, in spirit anyway.
DR SCOTT: great heavens, that's a laser.
RIFF RAFF: yes, dr scott. a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
BRAD: you mean you're going to kill him?
DR SCOTT: you saw what became of eddie.
RIFF RAFF: exactly, dr scott. now frank n. furter, your time has come. say goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.

RIFF RAFF: a decision had to be made.
DR SCOTT: you're ok by me.
RIFF RAFF: dr scott i'm sorry about your nephew.
DR SCOTT: yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
RIFF RAFF: you must leave now dr scott while it's still possible. we are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of transylvania. go now. the guests flee down the ballroom and out the door.

165A	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT: riff raff and magenta's laughter has subsided. 
RIFF RAFF: our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
MAGENTA: ah - sweet transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains. to take that step to the right...
RIFF RAFF: but it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
MAGENTA: and our world will do the time warp again.
165B	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN: there is a huge explosion.

BRAD: i've done a lot knows i've tried to find the truth i've even lied but all i know is down inside.
