MIKE: real fast.
BROOKE: far out!

LARRY: coming up! 
BOB: gangway, turkies!
ANDY: we're carrying weight.
LARRY: we'll take your supercargo.
JACKIE: is that me?
BROOKE: that's you.
JACKIE: i've never been supercargo.
LARRY: hey, get out of our air!
DONNY: want a passenger?

HENDRICKS: rich or poor, it's nice to have money. 
RED: figure they split?
HENDRICKS: happens every season -- someone takes off. once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
ANDREWS: this is all there is.
HENDRICKS: if that's it, that's it.

INDIGNANT MAN: i can't watch the news, i can't watch a ball game, i can't watch movies -- all i hear is that rotten kid with his rotten radio... "breaker, breaker..." 
BRODY: i'll do what i can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction...
INDIGNANT MAN: so call the fbi!
POLLY: black, two sugars.
BRODY: thanks. what else is out there?
POLLY: one petty theft, one domestic disturbance, and an exhibitionist.
BRODY: i'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others.
WOMAN: chief brody? i want you to do something about my first husband.
WHITE-HAIRED MAN: martin, you have got to demand that grace kinney keep her shades down.
2ND MAN: what about enforcing the "no parking" ordinance on beach road?
BRODY: in a minute, in a minute -- talk to mrs. prendergast, please...
WOMAN: albert keeps coming around when i'm with gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their cars...
2ND MAN: every time there's an out- of-state car in my driveway, i lose another mailbox. those little iron sailboats cost thirty-two dollars each!
BRODY: talk to me about mrs. kinney.
WHITE-HAIRED MAN: her bedroom window faces my oldest boy's bedroom, and she's teasing him, dancing around in a towel, or less...
BRODY: dancing?
HENDRICKS: chief...
BRODY: hendricks. i want to go over your reports and your form 908.
HENDRICKS: i never heard of a 908.
BRODY: i just made it up. it means, "get me out of there." what the hell's that?
HENDRICKS: diver's camera. tom andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
BRODY: abandoned? it's a little early in the season for that.
HENDRICKS: rich people. home port is newport, rhode island.
BRODY: if i had a $100,000 boat, i sure as wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
HENDRICKS: if you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
WHITE-HAIRED MAN: grace kinney is driving my boy to distraction.
BRODY: hendricks, get a description of that dance.
LARGE MAN: chief brody? i want to talk to you about my daughter... she's 15, but mature for her age...
WOMAN: chief, i've been telling mrs. prendergast that it's no good just talking about albert, she's got to do something...
2ND MAN: look -- the township is responsible for protecting life and property, and my property is unprotected...

TERRY: did you ever see a dolphin? 
DIANE: sure. they like to play. we may see some today.
TERRY: great!
TERRY: whoops, almost lost one. can't play with the dolphins without skis...
DIANE: ready?
TERRY: hang on, hang on... okay, go.

TINA: take a break for a minute, okay? 
ED: huh?
TINA: eddie, can we do that? can we go skiing? we can use my uncle's boat. eddie?
ED: next week.
TINA: with you, everything's next week. i want to go skiing soon. tomorrow?

CLOSE ON TERRY: rushing through the water, waving, stunting. 
TERRY: faster! faster!

TERRY: porpoise! look! a dolphin! 
UNDERWATER: closing in on the wake, crossing it.

DIANE: terry! you okay? 
TERRY: help! help!
DIANE: okay, okay, coming...

DIANE: terry! 
DIANE: help! help!

DIANE: a last flash before the gasoline explodes. 
DIANE: no-o-o-o-o-o...!

BRODY: there should be bodies. witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one skiing. 
HENDRICKS: i told you -- nothing here.
BRODY: try dragging.
HENDRICKS: for how long? current's moving everything around, and it's getting dark.
BRODY: stay on it. i don't care how long it takes.

TINA: we heard this noise, like a 'boomp' out there, and when we looked, there was just this cloud of smoke. 
GRACE: that was the explosion. one minute they were having a wonderful time, the next, bang!

GRACE: i don't know what could've done that. 
TINA: can we go now?
TINA: chief brody -- can we go? please?
BRODY: oh, yeah. sure.

RED: how much longer? 
HENDRICKS: until we find something.
RED: i don't care about the overtime, i'm hungry. and cold. and most of all, bored.
INSERT - THE WINCH CABLE: it goes taut with a sudden strain.
HENDRICKS: i think we got something.
RED: about time.
HENDRICKS: what the is it?
HENDRICKS: here it comes...

RED: oh drop it. 
HENDRICKS: what is it?
RED: power line.
HENDRICKS: oh, great.
RED: it comes here from cable junction.
HENDRICKS: untangle it and let's go -- we don't need a blackout on the island.
RED: now you're talking. let's get out of here before we do find something.

ELLEN: you have to smoke so early in the morning? 
BRODY: it's good with coffee.
ELLEN: so's a donut.
SEAN: i want fruit loops!
MIKE: eat cheerios.
SEAN: you eat cheerios. i want fruit loops.
ELLEN: eat cheerios.
BRODY: what're you guys doing today?
MIKE: i don't know about him -- i'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
BRODY: every day?
MIKE: what else is there to do?
BRODY: you could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
MIKE: do i have to?
BRODY: you'll have to make up your own mind about that.
ELLEN: where's my day book?
BRODY: in the den.
ELLEN: he doesn't have to work all the time, it's his vacation.
MRS. SILVERA: good morning -- everyone up early today?
BRODY: there's a lot going on.

ELLEN: why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up? 
BRODY: because, i'm in the middle of a boating accident, i got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a chief deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat. he's another one.
ELLEN: one what? ah-ha!
BRODY: boat nut. what is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
ELLEN: it's an island. got to run.

MIKE: i'm going. 
BRODY: what about tennis? riding? fixing up old cars? bartending?
MIKE: bartending? i'm 17.
BRODY: okay, not bartending. why on the water every day?
MIKE: because.
BRODY: look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
MIKE: i'll be careful. i'll see y'later.

BRODY: don't go out if it's rough or anything, huh? we've had a lot of trouble. 
MIKE: okay, okay.
SEAN: can i go with you today?
BRODY: you stay with mrs. silvera, tootsie. okay?
MRS. SILVERA: you can come with me to the market.
SEAN: all right.
BRODY: i'll be at the office.
SEAN: bye, daddy. i'm going to be careful, all day.

LUCY: where're we going? 
ANDY: oh, out a ways. maybe the lighthouse.
BROOKE: the lighthouse?
ANDY: no big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
MIKE: we got some stuff at the store. ed and tina are going to be there.
BROOKE: oh, sure, they would be.
JACKIE: what's the lighthouse?
MIKE: it's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. we sometimes hang out there, you know...
JACKIE: great. i got some wine.

BROOKE: the lighthouse is a make-out spot. 
JACKIE: now i really want to see it.
BROOKE: you going to fool around with mike? well, i'm not doing anything with him.
JACKIE: well, maybe i will, then.

ED: come on back up here! 
TINA: nope.
ED: give me back my hat!
TINA: double nope!

ANDY: why'd they decide to move? 
BROOKE: too hot in the lighthouse?
MIKE: too hot for those two? i can't believe it.
JACKIE: is there something i don't know about?
BROOKE: i told you, remember?
JACKIE: oh, yeah. so why aren't they doing it now?
ANDY: maybe by now they are.
MIKE: they're moving pretty fast.
JACKIE: he's cute...

CLOSEUP - TINA: reacting. 
TINA: yech!

BRODY: as soon as i heard about it, i called you. this thing is big! 
ELKINS: after we've looked, we'll talk.
HENDRICKS: this is it.
HENDRICKS: move back, please... back off... open it up a little...
BRODY: see? what'd i tell you?

BRODY: look at that! 
ELKINS: first things first.
ELKINS: from the tip of the snout, please.
ELKINS: length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
BRODY: come on, let's check the bite radius.
ELKINS: the what?
BRODY: bite radius. you know, the size of the mouth?
ELKINS: the whale's mouth?
BRODY: the shark's mouth.
ELKINS: what shark?
BRODY: the shark that did this. it was a shark, wasn't it?
ELKINS: we don't know that, do we?
BRODY: but that's what we're here to find out, right?
ELKINS: you don't tell me my job, and i won't tell you about yours, okay?
HENDRICKS: i can't hear you if you're going to whisper.
MIKE: can we go now?
BRODY: you stay here a minute.
MIKE: oh, c'mon.
BRODY: you heard me.
JACKIE: we'll be over by the lighthouse.
MIKE: i'll be right there. wait up.
ELKINS: could be a shark. but maybe not.
BRODY: look, i know a little bit about sharks.
ELKINS: do you?
BRODY: i know that this was probably a great white shark. car-cadon... caradan...
ELKINS: carcharadon carcharias.
BRODY: that's it.
ELKINS: okay, so that's it.
BRODY: is there one in these waters?
ELKINS: what makes you think there might be?
BRODY: because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish...
ELKINS: this is a mammal, not a fish.
BRODY: don't quibble with me. i want to know if a great white shark did this.
ELKINS: probably.
BRODY: that's it? probably? look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around...
ELKINS: and sound.
BRODY: sound?
ELKINS: sound. like sonar, or radar. they home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency vibration.
BRODY: so there's one around here.
ELKINS: not necessarily. these wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. none of them are immediately fatal. currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
HENDRICKS: we got a helluva tide this month.
BRODY: could you just keep that crowd back, please?
MIKE: pop...
BRODY: you stay right here. you're going in with me.

MIKE: we came out in my boat. 
BRODY: andy can sail in it.
MIKE: i got a date!
BRODY: she'll understand.
MIKE: she won't.
ELKINS: lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue. additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas, as well as the caudal. oriamal bite radius 37 inches, allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue attacks...
BRODY: i don't want to discuss it.
ELKINS: it's either a great white, or another killer whale.
BRODY: can't you tell?
ELKINS: not when it's like this. this animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
BRODY: look -- can great white sharks communicate? send out signals, or something? you know, take revenge, sense an enemy...
ELKINS: don't be ridiculous -- sharks don't take things personally.
MIKE: dad, please...
BRODY: no more sailing. you come back with me, and that's it.
MIKE: why me?
BRODY: because i say so.
ANDY: i'll tie up at the town dock, don't worry, man.
JACKIE: see you later, mikey...
ED AND TINA: later, bye...

VAUGHN: i'm showing summer rentals. we got a helluva season going. 
BRODY: we have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
VAUGHN: we're alone.
BRODY: larry, i don't know how to say this, but i think we got a shark problem. a real one.

VAUGHN: are you serious? 
BRODY: of course. look -- i've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator...
VAUGHN: no one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. be realistic.
BRODY: i got a feeling. i have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
VAUGHN: of course i can, but can't it wait? these things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
BRODY: we have to do something.
VAUGHN: we have done something -- hell, we near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
BRODY: i know, i know...
VAUGHN: and i stood by while you told the people from ramada and marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! in new england? we all lost on that one.
BRODY: it's still a good idea.
VAUGHN: martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke.
BRODY: please, larry -- there's good reason.
VAUGHN: a tragedy. but that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
BRODY: two of them are still missing!
VAUGHN: there's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. are they all shark victims?
BRODY: maybe they are!
VAUGHN: 
BRODY: i'll give you -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
VAUGHN: what am i, an ass? when you called me, i called elkins, and her bosses. nothing she saw is proof of anything.
BRODY: someone has to do something.
VAUGHN: don't push it this time. if you do, it won't turn out the way you want, i guarantee you that.
VAUGHN: i've got to get back to work.

BRODY: come on, give a guy a break. 
BRODY: come on. here boy. come to poppa...
BRODY: hoo! cold!
BRODY: come here. come on, sweetheart. you bastard. a little closer... here y'go...
BRODY: gotcha!

HENDRICKS: chief? 
BRODY: in here.
HENDRICKS: i missed you at the funeral home. santos said you were here.
BRODY: you didn't miss much. christ, what a mess.
HENDRICKS: positive i.d.?
BRODY: the woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
HENDRICKS: oh.
BRODY: what about that camera?
HENDRICKS: what camera?
BRODY: that one -- from the wreck. you brought it up, did you look inside it?
BRODY: well, what the -- might be something worth seeing. take it somewhere and see if there's film in it...
HENDRICKS: if there is, develop it!
BRODY: you got it.
HENDRICKS: i know just where to go.
BRODY: not the drugstore!
HENDRICKS: of course not, they're closed. phil fogarty's place. he'll do it for me.
BRODY: the drugstore's closed? what the time is it?
HENDRICKS: nine-thirty, ten maybe.
BRODY: -- i'm late for dinner... close up, okay?
BRODY: oh yeah -- i'm expecting a long distance call, very important. give them my home phone.
HENDRICKS: right.

ELLEN: thank you. i'll tell him. 
BRODY: for me?
ELLEN: sort of -- matthew hooper is aboard the research vessel aurora, presently in the antarctic ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
BRODY: 
MIKE: is hooper coming to dinner?
BRODY: not till next year.

BRODY: oh, hi -- how was dinner? 
ELLEN: oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. where were you?
BRODY: santos' place.

BRODY: oww! 
ELLEN: careful. what's wrong?
BRODY: nothing.
ELLEN: nothing, huh?
BRODY: that's what i said. is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
ELLEN: use the little brush there. why were you at santos'?
BRODY: found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
ELLEN: oh. want to talk about it?
BRODY: no.
ELLEN: terrific.
BRODY: michael.
MIKE: yeah?
BRODY: you want to come here a minute?
SEAN: hi dad.
BRODY: hiya yourself.
MIKE: what is it?
BRODY: i got something for you to do tomorrow.
MIKE: i kind of had plans...
BRODY: sailing? forget it. you're beached. grounded. no more boats.
MIKE: hey, come on...
BRODY: no backtalk! i spoke to upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. you can work until school starts.
ELLEN: all summer?
BRODY: he wanted a job, he's got one. i want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.

MIKE: dad, please... 
BRODY: tomorrow night. out of the water.

ELLEN: not so loud! 
BRODY: i know what you're going to say.
ELLEN: do you?
BRODY: in the city, it happened all the time -- some kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the brooklyn local, old people die alone in apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. call the cops. what are we, immune?
ELLEN: it was bad, wasn't it.
BRODY: the smell is always the same.
ELLEN: are you going to be able to sleep?
BRODY: yeah. i think so. mike! keep it down, for chrissake!

PETERSON: this is the town beach; the development naturally has its own private access, but i wanted you to see the concession area. look at that sand -- like sugar! 
ELLEN: during the summer, the sun sets right there... over the water. beautiful.
VAUGHN: i'll say hello for you.
NICHOLS: hello -- selling some more of the good life?
ELLEN: a piece here, a piece there, it all adds up.
NICHOLS: your husband's been here all morning. what's he doing?
ELLEN: his job.
VAUGHN: your dad got you working?
MIKE: yeah.
SEAN: i'm helping.
VAUGHN: you know where your dad is?
MIKE: up there.
VAUGHN: oh, for christ's sake.
PETERSON: and if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, ellen brody here will be happy to answer them.
VAUGHN: len, can i see you a minute? peterson excuses himself and joins the mayor.
PETERSON: i think we got a couple of live ones.
VAUGHN: brody's riding his tower.
PETERSON: oh,

JACKIE: this is fun! can we go faster? 
LARRY: trim.
JACKIE: yay!
LARRY: that's my dad!

VAUGHN: wave to my son. 
PETERSON: how the do we get him down from there?
VAUGHN: maybe nobody will notice. let's get them back in the bus.
MRS. BRYANT: renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there?
PETERSON: he's, ah, watching. a lookout.
MRS. BRYANT: for what?
RENEE: it's a shark tower. i saw one in florida. he's looking for sharks.
VAUGHN: it's an observation platform. that's our chief of police. he's just checking it.
PETERSON: normally, it's used for, ah, bird watching. nature observation. weather measurements, that sort of thing. ellen, we're running late!
ELLEN: okay. folks, if we could get back on, we'll show you the country club, and stop for lunch...
PETERSON: the country club has an 18-hole course, putting greens, and twelve tennis courts...

BRODY: get out of the water! tell everyone to get out! now! out of the water! 
VAUGHN: oh, my
PETERSON: what the is he doing?
NICHOLS: oh, no!
ELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN: looking up, startled at brody's sudden panic.

A SWIMMER: what's going on? 
ANOTHER SWIMMER: fish! anyone got a net?
3RD SWIMMER: someone get me a rod and reel!

BRODY: sorry. i'm sorry. false alarm... 
BRODY: okay, it's all over, go on, it's over. no trouble...
ELLEN: it's okay. it's over...
BRODY: it's all right, everything's all right...
ELLEN: let's go, everyone... mrs. bryant, len, please...

VAUGHN: brody's a good man. 
KAISER: nobody says he isn't.
PETERSON: you should've been out there. you should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. there were shots fired!
VAUGHN: he thought he had a good reason.
MS. NICHOLS: but that's not rational behavior!
PETERSON: that's what i'm saying!
VAUGHN: how many people were there?
MS. NICHOLS: hundred! literally hundreds. what are they going to say about us?
PETERSON: larry, i'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
VAUGHN: so? so?
PETERSON: so it can't be done like that. the man's a menace, plain and simple.
VAUGHN: look, what am i supposed to do? it's done, it's over. we have to deal with the consequences.
SANSOM: that's what we're here to do.
VAUGHN: all right. let's go into my office, where we can have a little privacy.

PHIL: i don't know what you did, but that kid stopped. i haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days. believe me, it's a pleasure... 
BRODY: you said something about a camera.
PHIL: sure, sure -- jeff hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and i didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in-law, in montauk, he works at a hi-fi store, and they sell cameras, so he...
BRODY: did you get any pictures?
PHIL: well, yeah, i did, that's the funny thing. you can't tell much from the negatives, i was going to blow 'em up. here's a test i did...

PHIL: not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4. look at the diffusion, though... 
BRODY: what else you got?
PHIL: let's see -- you got a minute?
BRODY: come on, phil, don't jerk me around.
PHIL: okay, okay -- stand over there...

PETERSON: speak of the devil. 
BRODY: thank you guys were all together. i got something for you. proof!
VAUGHN: martin, this is kind of an official meeting
BRODY: perfect. look at this --- he fumbles with the envelope.
VAUGHN: chief -- the board of selectmen has a question only you can answer.
BRODY: what?
PETERSON: is jeff hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim chief of police in your absence?
BRODY: temporarily? uh... sure... the question's out of left field. why are they asking?
NICHOLS: so jeff could handle things? he knows the routine, he has the authority?
BRODY: yeah. why?
PETERSON: it came up during the meeting.
BRODY: look -- i just got this from phil fogarty. it was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. it proves i was right, all along.
KAISER: seaweed?
NICHOLS: it's underwater, isn't it? that's why it's so dark.
SANSOM: i don't know -- what is it?
BRODY: it's a shark! a great white! it's right there!

VAUGHN: it's nothing i can see. 
BRODY: what are you all, blind? it's a shark. look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
PETERSON: is that what it is?
BRODY: you're right that's what it is.
NICHOLS: i'm sorry, i just don't see it.
VAUGHN: martin, it could be anything.
BRODY: what the does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? it's right there in front of you. i know what a shark looks like, i've been through it, don't you understand? i've seen this before! the selectmen look at each other in the face of brody's agitation. tempers are running high.
PETERSON: what have you seen before? this is nothing. seaweed. mud. something in the lens.
BRODY: my ass!
VAUGHN: be reasonable, please...
PETERSON: forget it, he won't listen.
BRODY: there is nothing to discuss.
PETERSON: will you listen to this man? will you just listen to him? you really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody decides to sue us? that could ruin us.
BRODY: is that what it is? dollars? money? i'll pay for it. take it out of my salary.
PETERSON: you don't make enough.
BRODY: maybe i don't make as much money as some rip-off artists around here, but i don't work the same way.
PETERSON: what's that supposed to mean?
BRODY: it means i don't like all that grab- and heavy breathing with my wife, it means i know who's out to screw me here, and it means that i know something none of you know because i've been there -- and i don't want to go through that horror again. ever!
VAUGHN: martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
BRODY: go ahead, whatever it's worth.

PETERSON: i won't mention his personal attack on me. 
NICHOLS: i've never seen him like this.
PETERSON: and hendricks is qualified, you heard that from his own mouth.
KAISER: we made a motion and it was already seconded.
VAUGHN: very well then. it is moved and seconded that martin brody be relieved of his duties as chief of police, his contract with the township be terminated, and that jeff hendricks be appointed acting chief in the interim. those in favor?
PETERSON: anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?
VAUGHN: i'm sorry, but i respect his convictions. the motion is carried.
VAUGHN: martin? could you come in please?

ELLEN: hi. i closed a sale today, without len. that's $1200 commission, if the papers go through. 
BRODY: that's great.
ELLEN: sean's asleep.
BRODY: that's great too. gorgeous.
BRODY: you look about 22 years old sitting there. like you were doing homework...
ELLEN: what's wrong?
BRODY: ooohh, nothing. i just got fired, that's all.
ELLEN: what?
BRODY: what'd i say?
ELLEN: that you were fired.
BRODY: then that's what i meant. fired. canned. out on my fanny. the selectmen just made hendricks the new chief of police. just like that.
ELLEN: because of today? the beach?
BRODY: no sweat. a blessing in disguise. back to the city, you can go to bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? me, surrounded by water... ridiculous.
ELLEN: stop that! we're not going any place. you love it here. tell me what the happened!
BRODY: showed them the photo, showed them the shark, big as life. they didn't see it. not like me. not like the poor who snapped this li'l picture... he's out there, somewhere... i shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me...
ELLEN: honey, this is nothing... i don't know what it is. what did they...
BRODY: ...everybody wants the job. no one wants the authority. except hendricks. fine. he can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. call me in new york... tell him to kiss my ass...
ELLEN: they have no right to treat you like that. you've given them everything. for four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island...
BRODY: fired me! i'm not a hysterical man. i'm responsible. i know what i saw...
ELLEN: i know you did...
BRODY: i try. goddamnit, i tried... now, i'm tired... i can't keep fighting it... i'm too tired... i'm... i'm...
ELLEN: you're drunk is what you are...
ELLEN: take it easy... easy...

ELLEN: shhhh. go back upstairs. daddy's sleeping. 
SEAN: what's this?
ELLEN: nothing, sweetheart. seaweed.

TIMMY: gaff rigged? why not a staysail schooner? go anywhere. look at this -- the mayan, an alden schooner.

MIKE: maybe you and brooke could come over to the town beach...
JACKIE: no way. everybody's going sailing. if you don't want to take me, just say so.
MIKE: that's not it. my dad told me not to go.
JACKIE: you do everything your parents tell you?
MIKE: no.
JACKIE: good. i'll be on the dock at eight. eight o'clock, everybody!
JACKIE: i really want to to be there. who's bringing the wine? and who's got a quarter for the box?

ELLEN: i'll give notice.
BRODY: don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
BRODY: mike left early. couldn't wait to make out. must be a morning man.
MRS. SILVERA: morning. anything special today?
ELLEN: sean's not up yet. you know what he likes, just some fruit loops and milk. no candy.
BRODY: the sink upstairs is busted. try some drano, or a plunger, maybe. or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name...
MRS. SILVERA: frankie. he's my cousin.
BRODY: frankie. okay. ask him if he needs an apprentice.
MRS. SILVERA: have a nice day.

ANDY: if you're beached, why are we doing this? for practice? 
MIKE: yeah.
ANDY: then why are we futzing around the dock? we can make a few bucks working at the beach.
MIKE: look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
SEAN: i'm not in the way. andy, am i in the way?
ANDY: you're always in the way.
MARGE: this guy giving you any trouble?
SEAN: put me down!
ANDY: put him down in the water.

SEAN: yeah.
MIKE: would you take him?
MARGE: sure.
ANDY: you've just made someone very happy.
BROOKE: mike! are you going out?

MIKE: i can go out if i want to.
ANDY: you can?

JACKIE: can't we stop?
BROOKE: they're probably looking for us.
DOUG: what about the fish?
LARRY: maybe it's gone.
DOUG: they tend to follow moving things. maybe it's following polo and timmy.
BROOKE: so all we have to do is land at cable junction and wait.
PATRICK: first we got to get there.
LARRY: how're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
BOB: anyone got another set of sails?
