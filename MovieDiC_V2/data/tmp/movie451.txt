OPERATOR: and what was this?
BARRY: i'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
OPERATOR: this is "fly with us?"
BARRY: it's hard to understand because it says in addition to but i can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
OPERATOR: i think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
BARRY: so, just to clarify, i'm sorry: ten purchases of any of your healthy choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
OPERATOR: that's it.
BARRY: do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
OPERATOR: i don't know...i mean: i don't know.

BARRY: can i call you back if i have any further questions...? can i get your extension? 
OPERATOR: it's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
BARRY: ok. thank you.

REGULAR JOE: take it easy, man, relax. don't --
DEAN: i'll relax your head -- this is my personal space, man, this is my personal space, you don't violate that, you don't do that.
REGULAR JOE: i've got a glass in my hand why don't you chill out?
DEAN: you've got a glass?

CRUSH YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.: dean gets in the middle of it; 
DEAN: take it easy, take it easy you guys in here, i need to talk to you later, tommy -- i wanna know if you wanna book the boys --
MAN: i'll talk to you later.

DEAN: your expenses are your own. 
DAVID: i thought latisha said you would --
DEAN: -- she didn't know what she was talking about --
DAVID: it's....whatever....that's not cool.
DEAN: david, don't. just. seriously. it doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. ok? it's business. seriously. one hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. i'm serious now. ok. please. now. just stop.
DEAN: ...keys for the track. you have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. his address. we have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
LATISHA: uch. shut up, dean.
DEAN: what's the problem?
LATISHA: you don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --

DEAN: flinchy. that's what i thought. shut up. call me when you see this guy -- check him out see what's what. she asked him for seven fifty when she was on the phone with him, so -- just call me when you get there. 
DEAN: this is this place called ace vintage, you gotta find it, i don't know exactly where this is and i don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. it's a '61 ac cobra that this old guy says is fine, but i need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. so take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then i'll head down there and check it out.
DAVID: ok.
DEAN: that's it.
DAVID: can we maybe ask for more money on this?
LATISHA: why?
DAVID: ...because it's california? i mean it's like a nine or ten hour drive. it's not like going to salt lake and getting the mormon's, it's different...

LENA: who is it? 
BARRY: it's barry.
LENA: hi.

LENA: so i want to tell you something, i gotta tell you: i saw a picture of you guys, your sisters and you and i saw your picture and i really wanted to meet you. i came to drop my car off there on purpose, to try and meet you. 
BARRY: ...really? that's nice...are you lying?
LENA: ...i thought i should tell you. i didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something -- beat. he leans slightly back in frame.
BARRY: that's very nice. thank you. thank you for saying that. you're friends with my sister?
LENA: yeah.
BARRY: how long have you known her?
LENA: about six months.
BARRY: you like her?
LENA: yeah. yeah we get along well. you didn't get along with her very well?
BARRY: did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
LENA: no, no. i did.
BARRY: that's nice. it's nice. i've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. do you remember all that pudding?
LENA: yeah.
BARRY: so that pudding was bought, i bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by healthy choice and american airlines. it's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying healthy choice products. they make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
LENA: yeah?
BARRY: ....i'm sorry....i lost my thoughts, what i was saying....
LENA: you were talking about the promotion --
BARRY: -- the promotion says: buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. so in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. that's those little bar codes, you know? the universal product codes?
LENA: yeah.
BARRY: that's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. add in the coupon: it's one thousand.
LENA: yeah.
BARRY: you see?
LENA: yeah, no, i see --
BARRY: you see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
LENA: that's insane. that is really, really crazy. that's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
BARRY: ....yeah....
LENA: so that was your pudding?
BARRY: ....no....
LENA: i'm sorry. i thought you said --
BARRY: no i didn't say that.
LENA: i thought you said you bought all that pudding --
BARRY: my friend carlos is doing it who works with me. it's his. it's his pudding, he's doing it. it's not mine. he's crazy. i told him not to do it. he's the one who's insane. he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
LENA: your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? is that right? you threw a hammer through a sliding glass door? barry starts to well with tears, which he hides very
BARRY: i don't remember that, she might be lying. i have to go the bathroom.
