LOIS: ...wuddya waitin' for, honey? plug him.
MARCUS: good-bye, willie. he aims. willie squeezes his eyes shut.
MEGAPHONE VOICE: drop the gun, munchkin!
MARCUS: huh? !
MEGAPHONE VOICE: and you, santa! -- drop the elephant!
MARCUS: ...where did you come from?
CHIEF: tipped off.
WILLIE: 
CAMERA TRACKS IN ON HIS FACE: willie slaps his forehead.
WILLIE: ...fuckin' kid!
CHIEF: all three of you are in so much it's almost unbelievable.
LOIS: gevalt.
MARCUS: oh yeah? well come'n get us, coppers! ha-ha-ha-ha!
WILLIE: me...
WILLIE: ...fuck me me me... gunfire fills the air.

MEGAPHONE VOICE: halt, put your hands up! 
WILLIE: up your ass!
POLICE VOICE: all right, boys -- nail him! a ripple of gunfire.

WILLIE: dear kid. i hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much i guess. 
WILLIE: ...anyway, just in case they took it as evidence i am also sending you a t-shirt. i hope it's the right size. i am healing up good and they tell me that i will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is anyway, ha-ha-ha. anyways...
WILLIE: ...thank you for giving that letter to the cops. i forgot i asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or santa's little helper would've plugged his ass. and now the cops know i wrote it, which is gonna keep my out of jail. that, plus everyone agreeing that the phoenix police department shooting an unarmed santa was even more fucked-up than rodney king. the cops are treating me like royalty now which is new in my experience. they are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole department. whatever.
WILLIE: ...as for my little helper, i am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad. i hope your dad doesn't go sucking from them like i did. meanwhile, i told the cops you had no one to take the care of you, so they set it up with mrs. santa's sister watching you till your dad gets back in one year and three months. they made her a guardian pro-temp or some such anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and jacuzzi.
WILLIE: ...so i'll be staying in phoenix now, telling the police how screwed- up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go. they're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so i'll see you when i come over to mrs. santa's sister in the jacuzzi. until then, don't take no from nobody. least of all yourself. anyways... see ya soon...
WILLIE: ...santa.
