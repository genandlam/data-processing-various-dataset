speaker1: ... i have a drinking problem!

speaker1: bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter. his shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray. behind him we see the apartment door opening. katie, an attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of the door, but stops, surprised to see osbourne. 
speaker2: you're home.
speaker1: hang on to your hat, honey. i have some news. i----
speaker2: did you pick up the cheeses?

speaker4: because i have lactose reflux. but i can----
speaker2: you're lactose intolerant?
speaker4: yes, but i can----
speaker2: or you have acid reflux? they're two different things.
speaker4: i know what they are.
speaker2: then you misspoke yourself. so i----
speaker4: thank you for correcting me.
speaker1: you should try the chevre, harry.
speaker4: yeah. i can eat goat cheese.
speaker4: ... i was just explaining to your husband here, i have a condition----
speaker1: harry works with the marshalls' service.

speaker5: ah. i'm on the legislative side, i work with senator hobby.
speaker5: pink revision 8/14/07 7.
speaker4: used to work for treasury, but i didn't go over to homeland security. i'm with the marshalls.
speaker2: if you want he'll show you his great big gun.
speaker4: very amusing. the gun is actually no big deal. twenty years in the marshall's service and i've never discharged my weapon.
speaker2: sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist.
speaker4: what? i don't have a psychiatrist.
speaker5: boy, i guess my job is pretty undramatic. i'm on the legislative side. what do you do mrs. pfarrer? do you also carry a gun?
speaker4: sandy writes children's books.
speaker6: i write children's books----
speaker4: oliver the cat who...who..arghh----who---- choking on piece of cheese, coughing

speaker7: those are wonderful! my nieces and nephews----

speaker1: yeah, it's a beloved series. you wouldn't believe her fan mail. unghh. 
speaker2: why don't you let your wife tell them about her own books, harry?
speaker1: i'm sorry----was i----
speaker2: here, come in the kitchen, help me with the cruditã©s.
speaker1: goddamnit. he knows, doesn't he.
speaker1: ... nice floors.
speaker2: knows what?
speaker1: about us, he knows about us. little prick.
speaker2: don't be an ass, he doesn't know a thing.
speaker1: what is that, forbo?

speaker1: what a horse's ass. 
speaker2: i don't know why we see them.
speaker1: well, she's all right.
speaker2: she is a cold, stuck-up

speaker1: you quit?! 
speaker2: uh-huh.
speaker1: well----thank you for letting me know!
speaker2: i tried to tell you this afternoon.
speaker1: you tried? you tried? and then---- what, the aphasia kicked in?
speaker2: our guests came. we----

speaker1: why?! for fuck's sake, ozzie! 
speaker2: i'm just----i don't know. i got so tired.
speaker1: you're tired.
speaker2: tired of swimming against the current.
speaker1: uh-huh.
speaker2: independent thought is not only not valued there, they resist it, they fight it, the bureaucracy is positively----
speaker1: did you get a pension, or severance or something, or----
speaker2: i didn't retire you know, i, i quit.
speaker1: but i suppose my benefits are all right, i suppose you can live with those, is that the idea?
speaker2: it's not like that's the only way to make money.
speaker1: yes? yes? what're you gonna do?
speaker2: i'll do some consulting.
speaker1: consulting.
speaker2: yes, to help while i----i've always wanted to write.
speaker1: write. write what.

speaker1: you okay there, dad? 
speaker1: ... dad, i left my job at the agency...
speaker1: ... i, uh... i'm sorry. dad, government service is not what it was when you were in state. things are different now. i don't know, maybe it's... it's... the cold war ending; now it seems like it's all bureaucracy and no mission...
speaker1: ... i'm writing a memoir. i think it's going to be pretty explosive. but i don't think you'll disapprove. i don't think you'll disapprove.

speaker1: but... sometimes there's a higher patriotism, dad. so we'll... yes, change is hard. it's hard on katie. but we'll be okay. we'll be okay. life is change. this is good. we were all blocked up, katie and me. this is, this is a blessing in disguise. i'll go into training, you know. lay off the sauce. like you did. you managed to do it. finally. and then i can concentrate on, you know. new beginning. and this'll all have been for the best. don't you think dad? the old man stares out into the wind. 
speaker1: ... cold.
speaker1: ... i guess we should head back.

speaker1: ... mrs. cox, you can't let this man take advantage of you. and he will. 
speaker2: yes. this is my fear. he's trying---- he says----he's trying to pull himself together, but...
speaker1: look, sure, i----i'm obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things. and you should. people turn themselves around. not unheard-of. but. you---- you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: well that's good. because first you should get all his financials. before he's forewarned. because here's a man, here's a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say it's his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances. paper files, computer files, whatever----this is your prerogative. you can be a spy too, madam. do this before you put him on alert. before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh...
speaker1: ... feet.
speaker1: ... and hopefully everything will work out. he will reform. but! if not: forewarned is forearmed.

speaker1: we were young and committed and there was nothing we couldn't do. we thought of the agency less as... less as... 
speaker1: ... the principles of george kennan----a personal hero of mine----were what animated us. in fact they were what had originally inspired me to enter government service. like the state department's china hands of yore, or, in a different forum, in a different venue, in a different medium, in, um... "murrow's boys," the fabled----in a different---- he suddenly stops, head cocked, listening. faintly, a ringing phone.

speaker1: you have reached the group... 
speaker1: ... we can't answer your call right now. please leave a----
speaker2: hello.
speaker2: ... yes?... oh, no... no, call her number... no, upstairs...no she's not, but leave it on her machine.

speaker1: he pauses for a long beat. 
speaker2: single...

speaker1: i should try to get a run in. 
speaker2: ozzie!

speaker1: from inside the room, male voices: 
speaker2: tune every heart and every voice...

speaker1: ... bid every care withdraw. let all with one accord rejoice... 
speaker1: ... in praise of old nassau...
speaker1: ... in praise of old nassau my boys, hoo-rah, hoo-rah, hoorah!
speaker1: ... her sons... shall give... while they... shall live...
speaker1: ... in praise of old nassau!

speaker1: bare. pale. middle-aged. 
speaker2: we take all the chicken fat off your buttocks, here... and here... and the upper arms. and a little off your tummy...

speaker1: ...and we do breast augmentation with a tiny incision here... and here. 
speaker2: uh-huh. and what about the thigh area?
speaker1: well we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise. buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises.
speaker2: uh-huh. i know, i can work out on my arms til the cows come home, but...
speaker1: uh-huh. and of course there are also genetic factors.
speaker2: the litzkes are big.
speaker1: uh-huh, well everything's----
speaker2: my mom had an that could pull a bus.
speaker1: wow. well that's a predispo----
speaker2: father's side too, although dad tends to carry his weight in front of him.
speaker1: uh-huh.
speaker2: in the gut area. derriere, not so much.
speaker1: okay.

speaker1: and what about the face, you know, the window to the soul. 
speaker2: uh-huh! uh-huh! very well put. well your eyes are one of your best features. but we can do something about the incipient crow's feet.
speaker1: baby crow's feet. little chickling's feet. i mean chicks. chickie chickie chickie.
speaker2: ha-ha, yes, again, well put. you have a way with words. we cut here...
speaker2: ... and we pull the skin tight, like stretching the skin over a drum. not too tight, though. we don't want that "worked-on" look. you need sufficient slack for the face to remain expressive.
speaker1: yeah, i don't wanna look like boris karloff.
speaker2: uh-huh! heh-heh, so you don't want a change!
speaker1: no, i'm all woman!

speaker1: yeah, i don't want to get anything burned off. 
speaker2: and why should you. with that lovely skin. and lastly, the breast augmentation. now we can also do something about the vaccine scar----i don't know if you wear sleeveless dresses much----
speaker1: not with these ham hocks!
speaker2: yes, well once they're nice and svelte, post-op, you----
speaker1: well i don't know. is the vaccine thing----can you counsel me on this? i don't know, is it unsightly? i see it a lot, a bunch of people have it.
speaker2: absolutely! some women don't mind it at all! personal taste!

speaker1: ow! 
speaker2: i'm sorry, was that too much?

speaker1: i felt a straining... a tightness in the... in the front of my ass... 
speaker2: well you're pretty tight. you have to feel it or----

speaker2: did you have to send a picture?
speaker1: no, only guys do. i submitted a verbal profile, turn-ons, turn-offs, et cetera. i'm really looking for someone with a sense of humor.
speaker2: that guy----wait----that guy wasn't bad.
speaker1: him?
speaker2: no, before.
speaker1: him?
speaker2: yeah. he uh, he might not be a loser.
speaker1: how can you tell?
speaker2: that's a brioni suit.
speaker1: oh yeah?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: does he look like he has a sense of humor?
speaker2: he looks like his optometrist has a sense of humor.

speaker1: linda slaps his arm. 
speaker2: ... huh-huh-huh. what does he do?
speaker3: state department.
speaker2: that's cool.
speaker3: his hair is... what is that?

speaker1: ...no, those are four different operations... it's very complicated; i'm reinventing myself, it's a whole new look so it isn't just one thing, however, it's all approved by my doctor... but----madam! this is not----my job involves, you know, public interface! this is not...

speaker1: her jaw sets. she controls her fury. quieter: 
speaker2: ... yes i do understand. could i speak to your supervisor please?

speaker1: alan? 
speaker2: are you, uh... linda?

speaker1: ... and then, you know, you grow up. i guess that's what's happened with me. you just... people change. we married when i was, what, in my mid- twenties. a kid. we were kids. twenties. you think it's forever. then, you know, you're older----you begin to feel your mortality, you start to think, well, there's no more time for dishonesty. subterfuge. you go, i'm not that person. the choices you made, you can't, just through inertia---- 
speaker2: i'm thinking of divorcing ozzie.

speaker2: so if i were divorced----
speaker1: well yes, if you were uh, you know, yes. yes, i should settle things. with sandy. because of you and me. it just takes, courage, you know. to inflict that pain. scary stuff.

speaker1: scary stuff. you're a brave lady. well, of course, it would be easier for you. 
speaker2: why's that? i don't see that.
speaker1: well you know, because he's such a dope. but sandy, she's... a good lady. a very special lady.
speaker2: she's a cold, stuck-up
speaker1: well that's... a little----
speaker2: you and i should sort things out. i've told you that this is not just frivolity.

speaker1: never heard of him.
speaker2: oh, like you're so plugged in to the intelligence community.

speaker3: well, that's----he sounds very senior. i think this is some senior guy who has screwed the pooch, big-time.
speaker3: blue revision 8/1/07 45.
speaker4: yeah, that's why we got him, you know, we've caught him with his thing caught in a big fat wringer.

speaker3: ... how many cities?
speaker1: seattle, san francisco, los angeles, chicago.
speaker3: why do they always have you do seattle. not a big market.
speaker1: i don't know, lots of independent bookstores. rains all day, what are people gonna do.
speaker3: i can think of a couple of things.
speaker1: you can think of one thing.

speaker1: it better be the peninsula. the money i make for them. are you gonna be okay? 
speaker2: i'll be sad. but i'll be okay.
speaker1: not too sad..
speaker2: just the right amount.
speaker2: ... i am crazy about you, baby.

speaker1: tony bennett, toni morrison and zoe caldwell. it was marvelous. first time i've attended the kennedy honors. jane alexander is a client. old friend of zoe's. what an actress. anyway... 
speaker1: pink revision 8/14/07 48.
speaker1: ... connie, could you bring in your copy of the financials?

speaker1: i thought i had it here on a disk----i don't know where the disk is. i'm sorry, i'll have to run another off my hard drive. 
speaker2: tony sang "the best is yet to come." mr. bennett.
speaker2: yeah, okay.

speaker1: so. we've drawn up the papers and are prepared to execute service on osbourne if you so elect, mrs. cox. our missiles are pointed at his capital, so to speak, and we await only your word. but, be mindful, madam: once these missiles are launched, there is no recalling them. we are not picking daisies. we are declaring war, and hostilities will then impose their own logic. i think you understand what i'm saying. 
speaker2: it'll ozzie off.
speaker1: mm-hm.

speaker1: mr. terikhian, i have given my husband second chances galore. there are limits to my charity. 
speaker2: of course. but since we are at the point of no return, i always urge my clients at this juncture to give it one more day of reflection.
speaker1: yes. understood.

speaker1: harry? i'm linda. 
speaker2: yeah, i did the whole bodyguard thing for years. my guy was in state, the secretary in fact, so of course i traveled a lot.
speaker2: ..."ironside is leaving the building." we called him iron ass.
speaker2: pink revision 8/14/07 50.
speaker2: ... not to his face, of course. not to his ass, either!
speaker2: ... ah, he was okay. but, personal protection----that's a young man's game.
speaker1: you wanna try these dumplings? they're delicious.
speaker2: sure...
speaker2: ... does it have shellfood in it?
speaker1: shellfood?
speaker2: `cause i have this sensitivity. i, uh, go into anaphylactic shock. my larynx swells up, closes off the----ah what the hell.
speaker2: live dangerously---- through a mouthful:
speaker2: ... can't always wear a condom.
speaker1: that's right! not always!
speaker2: anyway, my job's more administrative now, not so much pp. personal protection. though i still carry the gun.
speaker1: omygod, really!
speaker1: pink revision 8/14/07 50a.
speaker2: it's no big deal. never discharged it, twenty years service. security blanket now. i don't think about it---- course, you're not supposed to think about it;

speaker1: in a situation where your man is threatened the training kicks in. muscle memory. reflex----those are outrageous. 
speaker1: ... wanna swap?
speaker2: no way!
speaker1: ----but there was just a of a lot of political infighting, petty, petty, and then basically the old man stepped on goldberger's throat. nice...
speaker1: ... wide-plank pine?
speaker2: i guess.
speaker1: listen, full disclosure here linda...
speaker1: ... i'm not wearing a wedding ring but i am married. took the ring off, what, eighteen months ago when we agreed to separate. agreed to disagree. that's about the only thing we ever agreed on.

speaker1: thanks for telling me. i really do appreciate it, harry. 
speaker2: well, full transparency, the only way to----
speaker1: that's not gonna go off, is it?
speaker2: well let's go in the other room and find out! grrr!

speaker1: the soulful manager of hardbodies. 
speaker2: that's great. that sounds... exciting.
speaker3: he's very very communicative. very accessible. he has a sense of humor. and he agrees one hundred percent about my surgeries.
speaker2: well, i----
speaker3: he thinks my could be smaller. i mean, not in a mean way, he kidded about it----he's got a terrific sense of humor.
speaker2: that's good, but... but... linda, what do you really know about this guy?
speaker3: i told you, he's in the treasury department and he----

speaker1: but he could be one of these people who, you know, who cruises the internet---- 
speaker2: yeah, so am i!

speaker1: no, you can't go like that! you gotta wear a suit. 
speaker2: well----you mean----go home and change?
speaker1: yeah!
speaker2: i was gonna ride my bike. do i have time?

speaker1: ----which to my mind is all the more reason to lower the boom on ozzie. 
speaker2: mm.
speaker1: that's it? "mm"?
speaker2: i'm just... wondering if it's the right time.

speaker1: of course it's the right time. why wouldn't it be the right time. does it threaten you? 
speaker2: no no. no, you and me are rock solid. that's why i, uh, i think we can afford to be big. we can think about ozzie, whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you hammer him with, um----
speaker1: is that how you see me, "hammering" him?
speaker2: of course not, but----
speaker1: weren't those your words?
speaker2: yes, but----
speaker1: i don't "hammer."
speaker2: no, uh-huh, of course not. but, i'm saying----i'm no friend of the guy. you know that. i think he's an arrogant little geek. but for christ sakes, you and me have all the time in the world, and he just lost his job----
speaker1: he didn't lose it, he quit.
speaker2: yeah. most of the people who "quit" in this town were fired.
speaker2: ... i feel sorry for the guy. and he'll be easier to deal with when he doesn't feel... cornered.

speaker1: maybe. as long as we're talking about ozzie and not you. 
speaker2: of course we're talking about ozzie. baby, i stand by you whatever you do. i adore you.
speaker1: please get the check.
speaker1: ...yes?... yes?... is there blood in his stool?...yes, soon.
speaker1: it's after two. i have to get back to work.
speaker2: i love you so much.

speaker1: osbourne cox? 
speaker2: and you, i take it, are "mr. black"?
speaker1: yes i am. you have the money?
speaker2: the fifty-thousand dollars.
speaker1: that's what was agreed upon, osbourne cox.
speaker2: all right. let me explain something to you, "mr. black." you know who i am; i know who you are.
speaker1: perhaps. but appearances can be---- deceptive.
speaker2: yeah. what you're engaged in is blackmail, which is a felony. that's for starters.
speaker1: appearances can be----deceptive. i am a mere good samar----
speaker2: secondly, the unauthorized dissemination of classified material is a federal crime. if you ever carried out your proposed threat, you would experience such a shitstorm of consequences, my friend, it would make your empty little head spin faster than your schwinn bicycle over there.
speaker1: you think that's a schwinn?
speaker2: now give me the floppy or the cd or whatever the you have it on, and i will----

speaker1: as soon as you give me the money, dickwad! i'm not----huhgf! osbourne has punched him in the nose. chad stares at him, stunned. 
speaker1: ... you
speaker2: give it to me,
speaker1: you you fucker!

speaker1: i know who you are, fucker! 
speaker2: you're the fucker!
speaker3: where's the money?

speaker1: oh, for----get in! 
speaker2: that fucker!

speaker2: the russians.

speaker2: shot----your analyst?

speaker3: ... hi.
speaker2: hi. sorry to call out of the blue but i have a, well, a publishing question and i thought you might be the person to ask, i have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but i think it's pretty explosive stuff and i think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where i'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so i'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than i'd planned----i mean, like now, in fact----so i was thinking, i know you, and you seem to do well, so i was wondering if you were happy with your publisher. the people you use.

speaker1: you've written a children's book? 
speaker2: no! no no, a, a kind of a memoir, but ----doesn't your company have an adult arm? or isn't it, uh, the children's arm? of a regular publisher?
speaker1: pappas and swain do children's literature.
speaker2: uh-huh. i see. so they don't---- okay... are you well?
speaker1: very well thank you. and you.
speaker2: yes. good. okay, well, thank you sandy.
speaker1: yes. good talking to you. disconnect.
speaker2: 

speaker1: what kind of mickey mouse embassy are you running?! i've been waiting here for fifty-five minutes, and i'm---- 
speaker2: i am so sorry, madam. an urgent matter.
speaker1: well this could be urgent too, since, you know, chad has been missing for forty-eight hours now and----
speaker2: i don't know the whereabouts of chad, madam.
speaker1: well he was gathering information for you when he----
speaker2: we're not interested in such "information". it was drivel. linda is dumbfounded.
speaker1: ... dribble!
speaker2: would you like your disk back?
speaker1: ... dribble!
speaker2: i'm so sorry i can't help you.
speaker1: i'll tell you what's dribble! you listen to me, mr. krapkin! i am----
speaker1: blue revision 8/1/07 98.
speaker1: cut it out.

speaker1: ... what? 
speaker1: ... what the
speaker1: blue revision 8/1/07 99.

speaker1: no-o-o-o-o-o way. no way. whoa. no way, linda... 
speaker1: ... no.
speaker2: but ted, i can't do it, i don't know anything about computers.

speaker1: linda, the whole thing is crazy. it was crazy the first time, and you want to do it again? break into the man's house? and why would----why would----you said the russians didn't even want this stuff! 
speaker2: my world is bigger than that, ted. there's other people. there's the chinese.
speaker1: linda, these surgeries----
speaker2: it's not just the surgeries, ted! it's not just the money! we can use it as leverage! to get chad back!
speaker1: what do you mean "get him back"!
speaker2: information is power, ted! hel-lo!
speaker1: what do you mean "get him back"! you don't know where he is!
speaker2: somebody has him. and we can----
speaker1: you ask the police to help you find missing people! and you----
