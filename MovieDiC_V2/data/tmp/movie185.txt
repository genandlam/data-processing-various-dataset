speaker2: do you always rob the bodies of the dead?
speaker1: of course, we all do it. it's one of the perks of working in a hospital. stepan grumbles, accustomed to this teasing.
speaker2: did you know that your daughter robs the bodies of the dead?
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 10.

speaker1: stepan, is there an address? 
speaker2: you have an uncle who doesn't steal things from the dead. not even their secrets.

speaker1: who the fuck's that?
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 12.

speaker2: i know.
speaker2: sorry... i'm a midwife.

speaker2: that's amazing. my dad made gravy just like that.
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 15.

speaker1: this is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff. maybe you will have more luck there. but i think they will be closed until new year.

speaker2: i found her diary in her bag.
speaker1: why did you not tell me you found a diary?
speaker1: ok, anna, this is how it will be. you will bring the diary here and i will translate it for you. then if we get the names of any relatives i will call them myself. i am something of a... community leader for the russians here in this unfriendly city. what do you say?
speaker2: i was going to ask my uncle....
speaker1: and when you come i will make you some more gravy like your papa used to make and you can try the

speaker1: fish with the sauce. ok? tomorrow, yes? shall we say seven? 
speaker1: then it is settled. but for now, you must forgive me.

speaker1: `sentimental value'. i've heard of that. 
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 19.

speaker1: you're not staying for the party? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: nor me. chauffeurs don't get invited. you want to go for a drink instead?
speaker2: it's christmas. everything's closed.
speaker1: sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know?

speaker1: anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve? 
speaker2: i don't live with oliver any more, uncle stepan. i'm living back here for a bit.
speaker3: for as long as you want.
speaker1: i knew he would run away from you.
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 20.

speaker1: he didn't run away. you make me sound like a burning building. 
speaker2: black men always run away.
speaker3: oh stepan!
speaker2: what? i am allowed to be honest?
speaker3: he was a doctor, stepan.
speaker1: what the has that got to do with it?
speaker2: it is not natural to mix race and race. that is why your baby died inside you.
speaker3: stepan, shut up! please anna.
speaker3: you're just how he was. stupid drunken russians.

speaker1: it's christmas. i'm thirty-one. 
speaker2: anna, you know what he's like.
speaker1: i don't give a about stepan. who has that poor baby got in the whole world?
speaker2: i knew this would happen.
speaker1: good. fine. so you know everything.
speaker2: anna, she isn't your responsibility.
speaker1: the baby is my responsibility until i hand her over to the mother.
speaker2: then it's up to the proper authorities.
speaker1: the proper authorities will all be skiing until after new year.
speaker2: it's part of the grieving.
speaker1: what grieving?
speaker1: goldenrod revision - 11/27/06 22.

speaker1: in the last year you've lost your father and you lost a baby.

speaker1: green revision - 11/24/06 23.

speaker1: the driver stays down here. 
speaker2: you really think i do this kind of thing?

speaker2: i got tickets, ozim. it's with chelsea. they said there was no tickets but i got tickets for the chelsea game.
speaker1: ok, ok, ok. you go and watch a dvd, yeah?
speaker3: he knows to say he hasn't seen us, right ozim?
speaker1: he don't know anything. he's touched by the angels.

speaker1: that's him. 
speaker1: there was a time when he was like a brother to me.
speaker1: now he looks like a ice cream.
speaker2: hey, hey, show some respect for a dead man.
speaker1: respect? this is respect.
speaker1: ok, nikolai, he's all yours. and show some respect. this muslim is scared of ghosts.
speaker3: have you got a hair dryer?

speaker1: you'd better burn that. 
speaker1: did you finish cutting his hair?
speaker1: i just thought you might want six- fifty out of his pockets.
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 27.

speaker1: ok, now i'm going to do his teeth and cut off his fingers. you might want to leave the room. 
speaker1: you too, kirill.

speaker1: aren't you going to weight him down or something? 
speaker2: if you want to dump a body, this is the place. the currents keep it under the surface until past the barrier.
speaker3: my friend said he would get me to amsterdam and from there we could find a way into london. i have been practising my singing and

speaker1: ah. my dear! i wasn't expecting you so early. 
speaker2: is it ok?

speaker2: then i will bring what i have done to your home. where do you live, anna?

speaker1: i'm fine. i'm on my motorbike.
speaker2: so what will happen to the poor child?
speaker1: after christmas, they'll do a missing persons report.
speaker2: who will?

speaker1: yeah, yeah, i know. 
speaker1: what? you never seen anybody before?
speaker1: come on, kirill. where are your keys?

speaker1: we went to a kurdish place. they don't even celebrate christmas. 
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 32.

speaker1: hey, papa, what did i do? this is merry christmas or what? 
speaker2: i think he's had enough.
speaker3: who... the are you to tell me enough?
speaker2: we're partners.
speaker2: he's thunder, i'm lightning. he makes all the noise, i do all the damage.
speaker3: i hired you as a driver...
speaker3: ...someone to stop him killing himself.
speaker2: well, you got more than a driver.
speaker2: i run a mini-cab business.

speaker1: albanians, chechens, russians. they deliver packages. anything. anywhere. 
speaker1: i only took this job so that i could get to meet you. i think you and i could do business together.
speaker2: i have no idea what business you're talking about. now get out.

speaker1: you've got water in it. 
speaker2: water? what makes you think that?
speaker1: the postmen used these. in my village. when i was a boy. russian copy of bmw flat twin.
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 33a.

speaker1: get a bus. 
speaker1: you got far to go?
speaker2: just across the park.
speaker1: i'm a driver. i even do limousines. look...
speaker1: if semyon found out i let one of his guests walk home in the rain, he'd fire me. and i can take care of your bike. so...

speaker1: so you're a midwife. 
speaker1: what's it like?
speaker2: you get used to it.
speaker1: i didn't faint, but it was close.
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 35.

speaker1: how many have you got? 
speaker1: what, you don't know?
speaker2: yeah, i know, i know, it's just... it makes me upset, you know? thinking about it. this time of year. they're back in yekaterinburg. in the forests. near the mountains.
speaker1: left here.
speaker1: so semyon employs you?
speaker2: i'm... sort of freelance.
speaker1: you said he'd fire you.
speaker1: did you ever meet a girl called tatiana?
speaker2: i meet lots of girls called tatiana.
speaker1: she was pregnant.
speaker2: in that case, no, i never heard of her.
speaker1: she died last night on my shift.
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 36.

speaker1: i thought you did birth. 
speaker2: sometimes birth and death go together. she had needle punctures all over both arms. dehydration, emaciation. early presentation of syphilis. probably a prostitute. at the age of fourteen.
speaker1: you know what? i hate the rain. this time of year. you ever been to russia at christmas? man, snow that covers your whole house.
speaker1: oh yeah. and the ice. whole lakes covered in ice. you don't want to walk across them, though. ice gets thin where you least expect it.
speaker2: you think semyon's son knew her?
speaker1: like i said, i'm a driver. i go left, i go right, i go straight ahead. that's it.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: just here is great.
speaker2: how much do i owe you?
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 37.

speaker1: we think he might be russian mafia. 
speaker2: he is actually a chechen. he is also a member of the vory v zakone. the stars on the knees mean he would never kneel before anyone.
speaker2: in russian prisons, your life story is written on your body in tattoos. you don't exist without tattoos. he was a captain.
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 37a.

speaker1: but he has been processed professionally. 
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 38.

speaker1: anna? 
speaker1: stepan, come here. tell her what you told me.
speaker2: what?
speaker2: who gave you that?
speaker1: it was on the dresser.
speaker2: mum, you can't go through my things.
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 38a.

speaker1: you wanted him to translate it. 
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 39.

speaker1: and he said he wouldn't do it so i've found somebody else. 
speaker2: no anna! you don't go to someone else with this! you don't go to anyone! nasilovanie, it means rape. iglah, it means needle. prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess.
speaker2: i go to wash my hands.
speaker3: anna, stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone. do you know what that means?
speaker1: just because i'm back in this room doesn't mean i'm twelve again.
speaker3: you never listened to me even then!
speaker1: look, if i don't find a relative in the next few days they'll put christine out for fostering. once she's in the system, she'll never get out again.
speaker3: who named her christine?
speaker3: blue revision - 11/4/06 40.

speaker1: i had to call her something. it sounds like christmas. she's very beautiful. 
speaker2: if i can persuade stepan to translate it, will you leave the rest to the police?
speaker1: tell him i've heard bad words before.
speaker2: your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease. there's no cure once they've touched you.
speaker1: momma, this is london.

speaker1: ok, boss is here. boss, boss. you make him happy... 
speaker1: no crying. it's a party!

speaker1: so he said to me, `who is this driver guy?' i laughed so hard. 
speaker1: and i said you were the safest guy i'd met. solid.
speaker2: and what did he say?
speaker1: you know my dad. he didn't say nothing. but his eyes looked impressed.
speaker3: kirill!
speaker1: get out of the way, you black gypsy baboon.
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 42.

speaker1: ok, which one you going to fuck!? 
speaker2: what's it to you?
speaker1: serious. pick one.

speaker1: you hear me? you're going to one of these girls.
speaker2: ok, ok, jesus...
speaker1: you're going to one of these girls right now. that's an order.
speaker2: what? what's the matter with you?
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 43.

speaker1: i'm recommending you to my dad. i want to make sure you're not a queer.
speaker2: you've drunk enough kirill.
speaker1: enough?
speaker1: you siberian ox don't tell a vor what is enough.
speaker1: i've brought you to my dad's best stable. he uses this place himself. they're all clean. now i'm going to watch you one of these girls to prove to me that you ain't queer.
speaker1: so which one is it going to be?
speaker2: her. kirill smiles.

speaker1: you did ok! you did ok. 
speaker2: yeah?

speaker2: how did you get in here?
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 45a.

speaker1: there are always open doors, anna ivanovna. 
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 46.
speaker2: you're not allowed in here.
speaker1: please anna, let me speak.
speaker1: i translated the diary...
speaker1: i was shocked to discover... that my son kirill is mentioned many times.
speaker1: i have known for some years that he has strayed from the path i set out for him. his mother died when he was very young.
speaker2: what does it say about him?
speaker1: many bad things.
speaker1: but anna please. let me deal with him. if the diary should find its way to the police...
speaker1: some of the things my son did are illegal. anna, he is a good boy.
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 47.
speaker2: i don't care about him. i care about the baby.
speaker1: of course. of course. and that is the baby?
speaker1: anna, i have made some inquiries and i have found out an address for tatiana's family in russia. that's where the baby belongs, no?
speaker1: so... perhaps we can do a deal.
speaker1: do you understand me, anna?
speaker3: anna?
speaker2: it's ok. he's just leaving.
speaker1: you know where i am, anna ivanovna.
speaker1: and i know where you are.
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 48.

speaker1: ...like potato sacks. kirill came down after me and he hit me until i was bleeding. then he tried to me but he couldn't do it... he just got madder and madder and kept hitting me. in the end his father came down. it was the father who raped me. he shouted at his son...'if you don't break a horse, it will never be tame, kirill'. 
speaker2: hello dear. how was your night?
speaker2: stepan's arthritis is playing up. i'm taking dictation.
speaker2: would you like some tea or something?
speaker3: no.
speaker3: pink revision - 11/12/06 49.

speaker1: what's wrong? 
speaker2: he came to see me.
speaker2: the man from the restaurant. he came to the hospital.
speaker3: i told you this would happen! i told you!
speaker1: sit down stepan.
speaker3: the devil is loose now.
speaker2: i know it's my fault...
speaker1: it's no one's fault...

speaker1: we should just sit down calmly and think...
speaker3: i have a friend from ukraine who owns a gun....
speaker1: stepan!!
speaker3: ...from the war in afghanistan.
speaker3: white revision - 9/12/06 50.

speaker1: don't talk about guns... 
speaker2: shut up both of you!!!
speaker2: ok... now... what would dad have done?
speaker3: we all know what he would have done.
speaker1: and then he would have been practical.
speaker3: he would ask if there were bullets for the gun.
speaker1: no! this isn't our world. we're just... ordinary people.
speaker3: i dealt with the vory v zakone when i worked for the kgb.
speaker2: you never worked for the

speaker1: anna! 
speaker2: i was an auxiliary!
speaker2: white revision - 9/12/06 51.

speaker1: please! 
speaker1: what did this man want?
speaker2: the diary. in return he'll give us an address for tatiana's family. for christine's family.
speaker1: and that's all he wants?
speaker3: you cannot do deals with these people!
speaker1: this isn't a deal. it's an exchange of information.
speaker3: have you forgotten already what i just read to you?
speaker1: we must be practical.
speaker2: stepan, i think he was threatening to harm christine.
speaker1: then it's settled.
speaker3: no!! no!! no!!
speaker1: stepan, this isn't our world. we are ordinary people.
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 52.

speaker1: i swear i don't know nothing about it... 
speaker2: i said, don't lie to me!
speaker3: your dad is right, kirill. there's no point lying to him.
speaker3: ozim's nephew slit soyka's throat. kirill paid him to do it.
speaker1: shut your mouth!
speaker3: your dad always knows the truth anyway.
speaker3: but it's ok boss. you don't have to worry...
speaker2: i don't have to worry?
speaker3: i disposed of the body myself. the police won't find a thing.
speaker2: my son commits a murder?

speaker1: on my own doorstep? a fellow soldier! and no one thought to tell me about it? 
speaker2: the vory code says you don't talk to anybody about your captain. kirill is my captain.
speaker2: when i found out what had happened, i did what i had to do to clean the situation up.
speaker2: it was a matter of honor. soyka was spreading lies about kirill. about your family. kirill did the right thing.
speaker1: i decide what is right and what is wrong. you do not kill a vor for no reason.
speaker2: you know as well as i do soyka was talking to the police.
speaker1: for a driver, you are well informed.
speaker2: i've got connections with the chechens who export cars. soyka was speaking to the russian desk.

speaker3: anna! no! come back here!

speaker1: she was fourteen! read the diary! she was fourteen when he raped her! nikolai casually hits the key fob of his car. 
speaker1: you murdered her! you murdered her!
speaker2: anger is very dangerous. it makes people do stupid things. forget any of this ever happened. you're in the wrong place, anna ivanovna.
speaker2: you belong in there. with nice people. stay away from people like me.

speaker1: sometimes i think this is all a hallucination... 
speaker2: it is good to have someone who i can trust to do simple tasks.
speaker2: in this business, sometimes the biggest danger comes from the most stupid things. you can't afford to be careless in any area.
speaker2: nasdrovia.
speaker3: nasdrovia.
speaker2: so what was the lie that soyka was spreading about my son?
speaker3: it was nothing important.
speaker2: kirill had him killed for nothing important?
speaker3: i don't want to repeat it.
speaker3: pink revision - 11/12/06 61.

speaker1: for me you will repeat it. 
speaker1: you play with the prince to do business with the king. but if you want to do business with me you must be open with me. thieves- in-law.
speaker1: what was soyka saying about the prince?
speaker2: that he is a drunk. and that he is also... a queer.
speaker1: my only son.
speaker1: you know it never snows in this city. and it's never hot. london is a city of whores and queers. my son...
speaker1: ...i think london is to blame for what he is...
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 62.

speaker1: so why don't you go home? 
speaker2: the cold gets into my bones.
speaker2: and also... the kgb would be waiting for me.
speaker1: fsb. they are called fsb now.
speaker2: whatever they call them they are worse even than the kgb were. maybe the kgb and the vory v zakone were partners in a marriage. we had rules, they had rules.
speaker2: now in moscow, the thieves don't wear tattoos and the police don't wear uniforms. you never know who they are...
speaker2: you've heard about these new policemen?
speaker2: they get under you, over you, behind you, inside you. they are the ones you least expect.
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 63.

speaker1: the midwife said she had an uncle. 
speaker2: i met him.
speaker1: so you know what he looks like.
speaker1: she said he has read the diary.
speaker1: we can't trust a russian with that kind of information.
speaker1: do you understand me?
speaker1: perhaps you can deal with him.

speaker1: i thought i'd bring it back before it got stolen. lot of villains around. sorry about the chain. 
speaker1: i got that address you wanted.
speaker1: a little village outside st. petersburg. i know it. not much of a place for a kid to grow up in. especially not a girl.
speaker1: if you want my opinion, the kid would be better off in london. maybe with you. why not? tatiana's family don't sound like the kind of people who'd want another mouth to feed.
speaker2: you read the diary?
speaker2: so how can you keep doing what you're doing?
speaker1: i told you. i'm just a driver.
speaker2: you look the other way.
speaker2: white revision - 9/12/06 65.

speaker1: i'm a camera. the pictures stay in my head. 
speaker2: why did you bring me this?
speaker1: i don't know. i was passing.
speaker1: oh, and... your uncle.
speaker1: is it true he was in the kgb?
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: well, he's a brave old man. that's for sure.
speaker1: does he live with you?
speaker1: i fixed it. it should be ok now.

speaker1: so what did they say? 
speaker2: they were going to kill me. those chechens are savages.
speaker2: i pointed out that i am a muslim too and it is a sin for a muslim to kill a muslim.
speaker1: what did they say about my son?
speaker2: they said they would spare me only if i delivered kirill to them.
speaker1: you are being very honest.
speaker2: i fear you more than i fear them.
speaker2: white revision - 9/12/06 68.

speaker1: never again do business with any member of my family behind my back. 
speaker2: never. i will never listen to kirill again. i swear...
speaker1: do they know where to find kirill?
speaker2: they are like wolves.
speaker1: do they know what he looks like?
speaker2: no. they have just arrived from the mountains.
speaker1: then tell them you will deliver kirill to them.
speaker1: tell them to give you two days.

speaker1: mum... i can't get hold of stepan. 
speaker2: why do you want to?
speaker1: i need to check something with him.
speaker2: anna...
speaker1: he's not at home, do you know where else he might be?
speaker2: anna. haven't you had enough excitement?
speaker1: i think i've worked out who christine's father is.
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 70.
speaker2: why does it matter?!!
speaker1: it matters... to me!!
speaker2: you enjoy this.
speaker2: you're like your father. ordinary life isn't enough.

speaker1: what are you doing here? 
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 71.

speaker1: i don't know. i was passing. 
speaker2: if you're passing, you pass. you keep going, nikolai, come on...
speaker1: family is important to you people isn't it?
speaker2: 'you people'? what the is she talking about?
speaker1: tell semyon the baby i delivered on christmas eve is his daughter.
speaker2: what did she say?!
speaker1: when he raped her she was a virgin. then they gave her pills. semyon has to be the father!
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 72.

speaker1: she was fourteen! she was a child! 
speaker2: you don't use my father's name! you don't say that filth about him...
speaker2: don't even look at her any more.
speaker2: that's an order.
speaker1: tell him what i said.
speaker3: there is nothing to tell. slaves give birth to slaves...
speaker2: come on nikolai!!
speaker2: blue revision - 11/4/06 73.

speaker1: and if you open your mouth again, i'll tell my driver to stick his inside it! understand? maybe that's what you want! 
speaker1: you want to come in?! maybe we all get to you....

speaker1: that girl you in front of me... you remember her? the ukrainian 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: so they kick down the door. these are ordinary police. they ask for her by name and they take her away. some punter must have given them her name. what gives the police the right to take our women, huh?
speaker1: hey papa, i never seen so many old people in one place. whose party is it out there? the angel of death?
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 74.

speaker2: come on, nikolai, help me.
speaker1: no. he stays here. i want to talk business.
speaker2: what business?
speaker2: papa, what business? his business is my business.
speaker1: go to the cellar kirill. and take your time.
speaker1: did you deal with the old man? nikolai nods.
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 75.

speaker1: it's time you joined us. 
speaker2: thank you. papa.
speaker2: what shall i tell kirill?
speaker1: tell him i changed my mind about the brandy.

speaker1: my dad swapped a little georgian girl for this stuff. 
speaker1: hey, don't feel bad. what happened up there is just how he is. he plays people against each other. that's all. i realize more and more what he's like. here, drink to the georgian girl...
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 76.

speaker1: what? i drink alone now. 
speaker2: he offered me stars. i accepted them.
speaker1: some stuff will take a long time. i've been protecting you until now.
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: what?
speaker1: you think i don't know stuff you don't know? i am vor by birth.
speaker2: i know, kirill.
speaker1: where the are you going? we've got to celebrate. help me with these bottles.
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 77.
speaker2: your dad don't need the bottles any more.
speaker1: hey! we're still partners, right? thunder and lightning!

speaker1: we can see that you were in prison in siberia. and that you were a thief. 
speaker2: my father was a government worker. he fixed the cars of officials. i began by selling the spare parts when i was fifteen.
speaker1: you have no forced tattoos?
speaker2: none.
speaker3: you were not co-operative?
speaker2: i spent two years in the punishment block.
speaker1: you went through the crosses in st. petersburg?
speaker2: i was in solitary confinement fifteen times. i was called 'the stump' because they couldn't shift me.
speaker1: your father was a and a weak for working with the government, that's right isn't it?
speaker2: that's right. my father means nothing to me. my mother....
speaker3: you have no mother. she was a anyway.
speaker3: pink revision - 11/12/06 79.

speaker1: yes. i have no mother and no father. there is only the code, the vory v zakone code which i have always followed. 
speaker2: that is why there is an empty place above your heart. where the stars will go. and why there is an empty place on your knees.
speaker1: i am dead already. i died when i was fifteen. now i live in the zone all the time.
speaker3: you have never worked for the government? any government?
speaker1: i have lived off albanians and georgians. i steal from them within the law.

speaker1: have you slept at all? 
speaker1: i tried to get hold of stepan for you.
speaker1: he's usually either at home or at his sisters. but she hasn't heard from him at all.
speaker1: he did spit in that horrible man's face.
speaker2: i don't think the driver would do anything to stepan.
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 81.

speaker1: how do you know what he would do? 
speaker1: you haven't spoken to him since, have you?

speaker1: semyon recommends these places for business meetings because you can see what tattoos a man has. 
speaker1: come on. we have a lot to get through. let's cook.

speaker1: our lines to kabul get broken every two or three weeks. 
speaker2: how come?
speaker1: the americans. nato. valery nabokov imports flowers and television sets into this country. the television sets are one in ten. that means one in ten have cargo inside them.
speaker2: where do they dock?
speaker1: i will tell you when i return from the bathroom.

speaker1: i'm so late. sorry. 
speaker1: oh
speaker2: it's fine, although i think i've had enough.
speaker1: paul, on my way here i made a decision.
speaker2: you can't possibly dump me. we're not even going out.
speaker1: take my hand.
speaker1: feel my pulse.
speaker1: i'm going to apply to adopt christine.
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 85.

speaker1: anna? 
speaker2: is it ok to talk to him for a minute?
speaker1: he's still in trauma. do you know him?
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 86.

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: i thought you did birth.
speaker1: my uncle....
speaker1: ...the one who spat in your face... he's disappeared.
speaker1: if we don't hear from him soon we're going to the police...
speaker1: do you know where he is?
speaker2: yes.
speaker2: he's in scotland. in edinburgh. in a five-star hotel.
speaker2: white revision - 9/12/06 87.

speaker1: edinburgh? 
speaker2: i'm going to need some clothes. i arrived here without any. can you get me some?
speaker2: i can't walk out of here naked.
speaker1: you can't walk out of here because you're attached to a drip. explain edinburgh.
speaker2: your uncle knew too much.
speaker2: i was told to get rid of him. i was meant to send him to heaven with a bullet in his head. instead i sent him to edinburgh. with a first-class ticket.
speaker2: he is of the old school. he understood the situation. exile or death. edinburgh was his idea. he said they throw a great party at new year. and he said it was a good excuse to get away from his family.
speaker2: so... just a pair of jeans and a t- shirt. a jacket. and some shoes. anna still looks disbelieving. nikolai sighs.
speaker2: goldenrod revision - 11/27/06 88.

speaker1: ...no, i couldn't get much sense out of him, he was drunk. 
speaker1: mum, i don't want to tell you how i found him because i don't want another argument. i just wanted you to know he's definitely safe...
speaker1: no, we can't tonight. i'm working. i need the money. for a place of my own, for christ's sake! she listens with growing anger until she finally cuts the call without a word. christine stirs but doesn't wake.

speaker1: you got my message? 
speaker2: using a dead body to file a progress report must be against fsb regulations.
speaker1: it's called improvisation.
speaker2: you've been improvising quite a lot lately. and taking risks.
speaker2: maybe too many.
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 90.

speaker1: in light of what has happened to you... 
speaker2: ah,
speaker1: ...and in light of other violent incidents associated with you, the russian desk at scotland yard have made an official request to the russian embassy that your undercover operation in london be terminated.
speaker1: you have gone beyond what was agreed.
speaker1: in my opinion you should see this as good news. you've been in the zone far too long...
speaker1: my
speaker2: if they terminate the operation now, they will be wasting this...
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 91.

speaker1: you tell the russian desk you saw stars over my heart. ok? tell them i'm through the door. 
speaker2: they are bound to ask... who did you kill?
speaker1: tell them i only killed myself. a pause. yuri is humbled. they share a moment of understanding as they smoke. finally...
speaker1: and you can tell them i'm going to replace semyon at the head of the london organization.
speaker2: what drugs are they giving you?
speaker1: i need you to take semyon out of the picture. i want you to arrest him.
speaker2: arrest him for what?
speaker1: rape.
speaker1: the girl was fourteen.
speaker1: blue revision - 11/4/06 92.

speaker1: and of course, she will testify... 
speaker2: she doesn't have to. she's dead.
speaker2: but she had semyon's baby. if you prove the baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was conceived, that's statutory rape.
speaker2: all you need is the baby and some of semyon's dna. for poetic reasons i suggest you take his blood.
speaker1: you intrigue me.
speaker1: if we had never had this conversation they would have sent you home. you could have spent the spring in the mountains. riding your bicycle to your office every morning through fields of flowers.
speaker1: why stay?
speaker1: you keep in touch.
speaker1: pink revision - 11/12/06 93.

speaker1: how is uncle stepan? 
speaker2: they're from the morgue. they belonged to someone who died yesterday.
speaker2: i can't believe i'm doing a favor for someone just because he had the decency not to murder a member of my family.
speaker1: hey... wait a minute...
speaker1: is your bike still working ok?
speaker2: yeah. it's ok.

speaker1: did you get in touch with tatiana's family in russia? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: good.
speaker1: so the baby's still in england.
speaker2: she's staying here for good.
speaker2: why do you care?
speaker2: stepan said you were kind to him. he said you were risking your own life to keep him alive.
speaker1: yeah, and all the thanks i get is a pair of dead man's shoes. i listen to you.
speaker2: do you really?
speaker1: yes. about semyon and the baby. thank you.

speaker1: what are you looking at? 
speaker2: you.
speaker2: what were you and grandpa shouting about last night?
speaker1: nothing, baby.
speaker2: it sounded like something.
speaker1: someone i know got hurt and i blamed grandpa.
speaker2: did you fight each other? i heard banging.
speaker2: pink revision - 11/12/06 96.

speaker1: no. it's not a fight if one of you doesn't fight back. 
speaker1: so, today i do as i am told.
speaker1: maria. go upstairs.

speaker1: you'll have a drink, yuri... 
speaker2: i don't drink on duty.
speaker1: sometimes i don't believe you are really russian.
speaker2: i've told you, i am half russian.
speaker1: then have half a drink.
speaker1: white revision - 9/12/06 97.

speaker1: so what is all this nonsense? 
speaker2: we just need a blood sample.
speaker1: for what?
speaker2: we can take the sample right now voluntarily or i can get an order from the court. it's up to you.
speaker1: he sits there like a vampire.
speaker2: what, you are afraid of needles, semyon?
speaker1: i am afraid of... conspiracies.
speaker2: i will return tomorrow with a court order.
speaker1: wait. i've done nothing wrong.

speaker1: what did they want with you, papa? 
speaker2: to poison me.
speaker2: they took blood from me with a needle. probably the same needle they use for all the junkies and whores and blacks and queers.
speaker2: now i probably have the queer disease.
speaker1: why would they want your blood, papa?
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker2: someone is ahead of me. i don't like people ahead of me.
speaker2: blue revision - 11/4/06 99.

speaker1: maybe it's about the baby. 
speaker2: what baby?
speaker1: some was out there saying you were the father of a baby. semyon turns to kirill, his face hardening...
speaker2: what are you talking about?
speaker1: it was nothing. just some
speaker2: who?
speaker1: the woman from the hospital. the midwife.

speaker1: sonya! is someone bathing christine?

speaker3: kirill, a vor doesn't kill little babies.
speaker3: something like this would be bad for all of us. your dad has gone too far, kirill.
speaker3: it's our turn now.
speaker2: i swear i didn't know my dad was setting you up.
speaker2: yellow revision - 11/21/06 105.

speaker1: we can be partners again. thunder and lightning, right?
speaker1: get into the car. i'll drive you home.
speaker1: you're ok, yeah?
speaker2: who are you really? why have you helped us?
