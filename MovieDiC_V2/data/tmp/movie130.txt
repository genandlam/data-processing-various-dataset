speaker1: come on... just a little lower... 
speaker2: come on... i'll take good care of you. all the bugs you can eat.

speaker1: hey, darren! 
speaker1: did you fall in? darren!
speaker2: shhh...
speaker3: you're gonna scare him away.

speaker1: man, we're getting killed out there. it's three to nothing. 
speaker2: your problem, steve, not mine...

speaker1: goal! three to one! 
speaker1: three to two!
speaker1: what does that prove? huh?
speaker2: go get the ball. it's 3 to 2.

speaker1: that's why he kicked it. to kill time. well, i still got time to kick your face. 
speaker2: forget it. the ball.
speaker3: thanks, darren. he's crazy.

speaker1: you 
speaker1: look at this.
speaker1: .human oddities and other living curiosities...
speaker1: other. does that mean not human?

speaker1: darren shrugs, takes the flyer. 
speaker2: a freak show. ever been to one?
speaker3: just this school.

speaker1: sword swallower and glass eater: ohio gray. frog boy: avery childs. human skeleton: j.d. combs. .and then... 
speaker2: i gotta show you something...

speaker1: i don't get it. 
speaker2: vampires. i've been studying them.
speaker1: right. you're failing half your classes at school, but you're studying vampires.
speaker2: they been around 1000's of years.

speaker1: what? when? 
speaker2: okay, sometimes, when humans fight? they fight at the same time. and no one knows it. like at the battle of stalingrad they fought at the same time the russians and germans were fighting.
speaker2: some people know about it. there have even been books written.
speaker1: that's your proof? it smells.
speaker2: it's everywhere if you look. on the internet, in blogs, newspapers, weird places. but you can find it.
speaker2: i chatted online with one of them.
speaker1: come on.
speaker2: serious.

speaker1: here he is in 1923. and here 1855. huh? maybe he'll be there tonight. would that make you believe? 
speaker2: how'd you know?
speaker3: saw your shadow on the floor. gotta try harder, knucklehead.
speaker1: i'm gonna get a soda.
speaker3: get me one, too.

speaker1: i know you want to fight global warming, darren, but that's not the way to do it. 
speaker2: sorry, mrs. shan.
speaker1: oh hi, steve. i thought you were, darren.

speaker1: i wish i was. 
speaker1: you guys got everything in here.
speaker2: help yourself.
speaker2: how's your mother?
speaker1: she's okay... she's been working a lot lately.
speaker2: glasses are up there.
speaker1: i know.
speaker2: hello?

speaker1: i gotta go. see ya tonight. 
speaker2: huh? tonight where?
speaker1: cirque du freak.
speaker2: i got no money right now.
speaker1: don't sweat it. i got money. meet me ten to midnight. the zeiterion theater.
speaker2: that place is supposed to be haunted.
speaker2: what am i going to tell my parents?
speaker1: tell them you're sleeping over. we can meet early, walk over together.
speaker2: i don't know, man...
speaker1: d, it's cirque du freak. you wanna hear about it monday? or see it tonight?

speaker1: and that's why we need a dog. 
speaker2: we'll have to think about it.
speaker1: how do you guys decide who's going to say no when you look at each other.
speaker2: whoever's eyes are the widest. and i didn't say no. yet.
speaker3: mom? i'm gonna sleep over steve's tonight? okay?
speaker4: no.
speaker3: what? why not?
speaker4: because i said so, darren.
speaker3: i'm fourteen. i shouldn't even have to ask stuff like this.
speaker4: the answer is no. and i'm not sure i want you hanging around with steve anymore.
speaker3: i've known him since i was five years old!

speaker1: people change and i don't like the way steve's changing. 
speaker2: but -- that's not fair!
speaker3: stop arguing with her, darren.

speaker1: i came here after your house. there was a van there, guy selling tickets. rest is history. 
speaker2: you know why they closed it, right? years ago a kid fell out of the balcony and died. it's haunted.

speaker1: the balcony. where he fell... 
speaker2: may i help you?
speaker3: we're here to see the show.
speaker4: ticket.
speaker4: do you have your ticket? darren.
speaker4: this way. we're about to begin.
speaker1: he knew my name.
speaker3: maybe he heard me say it.

speaker1: .bringing the remarkable and grotesque to generations. our freaks are not people in masks. they are not harmless misfits. what you see tonight is real. each performer unique. none harmless. 
speaker1: beauty and the beast.

speaker1: it's not true. that all tarantulas are poisonous. though some can kill a man. with one bite. 
speaker2: reacts. a spider!

speaker1: crepsley makes the introduction. 
speaker2: her name? madam octa. pray that she never learns yours.
speaker2: no...? shall it be life?
speaker2: i wonder if you would be as shocked to see the same fate for me?

speaker1: for her bite there is no cure. 
speaker2: thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
speaker3: but... what happened to him?!
speaker2: don't you know? what happens to us all, can happen to any of us.

speaker1: let's get outta here. 
speaker2: no, you go. i'm staying.
speaker1: wait. what're you doing?
speaker2: this is my destiny. don't ruin it.
speaker2: that car today. it was a sign. sending me here. i was told there'd be a sign.
speaker1: told by who? the guy in the chat room? the internet guy?
speaker2: i'll tell you later. if i can.
speaker1: steve...

speaker1: coming down the creaky stairs. spooky. 
speaker1: steve...

speaker1: are you looking for me? steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- smash! 
speaker2: rooted to the spot. watching...

speaker1: i -- i know who you are. 
speaker2: tell me, boy. who am i?
speaker1: you're a vampire.
speaker2: too broad a definition. do you introduce yourself as a human? who i am is larten crepsley.
speaker3: moving slightly to get a clearer view.

speaker1: who sent you and what do they want? 
speaker2: nothing. no one.
speaker1: then what do you want?

speaker1: i want to join you. 
speaker2: join me? i don't understand.
speaker1: i want you to make me a vampire.
speaker2: is it because you want to live forever? because we don't.
speaker1: i don't care about living forever. but you do seem to live a long time.
speaker2: a long time alone. do you want to live alone?
speaker1: i already do.
speaker2: are you an orphan?
speaker1: my father's gone; my mother doesn't care about me.
speaker2: nor mine. you're friendless also?
speaker1: i have a friend, but he doesn't understand. he's got too much to know what it's like to be alone.
speaker1: when you're alone you feel weak. useless. but i know there must be something strong about it, too. i want to feel the power of being alone. i want to be a vampire.

speaker1: the power of being alone will never be greater than the weakness of it. 
speaker2: i don't care.
speaker1: it makes no matter. we do not blood children. i'm sorry.
speaker1: do you intend to use that on me?
speaker2: do it. make me a vampire.
speaker1: do not tempt me.

speaker1: what's wrong? 
speaker2: you have bad blood.
speaker1: what do you mean?

speaker1: i can taste the menace in your blood. you can never be a vampire. you're evil. 
speaker2: that's a lie. you take that back!
speaker1: go home.

speaker1: a freak show? are you kidding me? 
speaker2: it was down at the old zeiterion theater. look, dad, i'm sorry.
speaker1: you told me the other day you were broke. you were looking for a job to do around the house this weekend.
speaker2: yeah? so?
speaker1: where'd you get money for the show?
speaker2: steve had money.

speaker1: steve... we weren't going to tell you, but we think steve stole money from your mom's purse yesterday. 
speaker2: he wouldn't do that.
speaker1: mom's pretty sure about it.
speaker2: man, what is this? you don't want me hanging around with him. now you say you think he stole money?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: steve's had some bad times lately.
speaker1: being a good friend and sneaking out are two different things.
speaker2: i have to sneak out! you treat me like a kid!
speaker1: then act like an adult if that's how you want to be treated. this world is crossed by fences --
speaker3: i know, i know. and you gotta decide which side you stand on. and you can't sit on it either.
speaker1: a freak show. what do they do, put people in cages for everyone to laugh at?

speaker1: is he in a lot of trouble? 
speaker2: nothing a few years in prison won't take care of.
speaker1: i don't see what the big deal is...
speaker2: did you talk to steve's mom yet?
speaker3: get this. she said she couldn't comment because she didn't make it home last night herself.
speaker1: where was she?
speaker3: go tell darren it's breakfast.

speaker1: annie, you gotta learn to knock. 
speaker2: mom said to come eat. what's that?
speaker1: out.

speaker1: mom, this is the best omelette i ever had. 
speaker2: hey, midget, where's the idiot?
speaker2: hi, mr. shan, mrs. shan. it's nice to see ya.

speaker1: what was that? everyone acting like they don't know me. did i walk in on something? 
speaker2: what happened last night?
speaker1: nothing. i hung out in the theater for awhile, but no one was around.
speaker1: sorry about the way i acted. i'm sorry i pushed you.
speaker2: don't worry. there's, you know, no bad blood or anything like that.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i said don't worry.
speaker1: you said bad blood. i never heard you say something like that before.
speaker2: what are you, the word police?
speaker2: wanna see that new game i got?
speaker1: sure...

speaker1: i gotta get one of these. 
speaker2: let me see that --
speaker1: it's madam octa.
speaker2: i took it at the show.
speaker1: liar. look at the background. this got taken right on your desk.

speaker1: how'd you do it? 
speaker2: they were loading a van outside.
speaker1: just like that... you stole from a vampire you know?
speaker2: just because he had a coffin doesn't mean he's really a...
speaker1: you were there, weren't you?
speaker1: you heard what he said to me? that i was evil?

speaker1: i didn't believe it. 
speaker1: i heard what you said to him, too. that you wanted to be a vampire.
speaker2: how do you think he made her do what he wanted?
speaker1: i wish i knew how to play it.
speaker2: i think that was just for show. i think he used something else. some kind of mind control.
speaker1: you mean telepathy?
speaker2: i bet anyone with a brain could do it. which leaves you out.
speaker3: can i come in?
speaker1: i swear to annie...
speaker4: what? i knocked.

speaker1: don't move. 
speaker1: steve...
speaker2: darren, he's freezing.
speaker1: get dad. go.

speaker1: what kind of spider was it? 
speaker2: i think some kind of a tarantula.
speaker1: where is it?
speaker2: it got away.

speaker1: we have a picture of it. 
speaker2: anaphylactic shock. get doctor lund. and we need to download a photo to poison control.

speaker1: how did you make this and why would you make this? 
speaker1: poison control couldn't id it. in fact, the department of entomology at harvard couldn't find it in their data base. so either it's a new species or it's a fake photo.
speaker2: if my son said he took that photo, then that's the truth.
speaker3: what have you done to him?!
speaker4: did you hurt stevie?! did you?!

speaker1: what have you come for this time? 
speaker2: crosses don't hurt you?
speaker1: why should they?
speaker2: because... you're evil.
speaker1: am i? are vampire bats evil when they drink the blood of cows?
speaker2: that's different. bats are animals.
speaker1: so am i. so are you. our appetites don't make us evil. why are you here?
speaker2: your spider bit my friend steve.
speaker2: he's dying.
speaker1: yes, well, boys who play with things they do not understand can hardly complain if --

speaker1: you have to help him! 
speaker2: the antidote to her poison is rare. expensive. why should someone as evil as i am waste it on steve?
speaker1: i'll pay you back. if it takes 50 years. whatever it costs.
speaker2: money doesn't interest me.
speaker1: there's something you want. that's why you're here waiting for me. right?
speaker2: the night steve came below to speak to me, you were there. did you hear what we talked about?
speaker1: he wanted to... become like you.
speaker2: you don't just 'become' a vampire. the change is too extreme. and if the shock didn't kill you, your inexperience would. so you become one in stages. a half-vampire at first. with greater strength than a human, but still able to go out in sunlight. you learn from a full vampire. do you understand?
speaker1: i think so...
speaker2: but your friend has bad blood. he's no good. there's no telling what he'll become as he matures.
speaker1: i don't believe that someone can have bad blood.

speaker1: and yesterday you didn't believe in vampires. regardless, i've left the cirque. left my protection. i need someone to protect me while i sleep. i need an apprentice. 
speaker2: me?
speaker2: you're crazy. there's no way.
speaker1: then your friend will die.
speaker1: you hardly have a choice. it's your destiny.
speaker2: destiny? that doesn't make sense.
speaker1: try this then. you're reckless enough to steal, responsible enough to come back for a friend. that's enough for me.
speaker2: not for me.
speaker1: yes, well, destiny can't be explained. it must be lived. now, you're wasting my time.
speaker2: there's gotta be another way.
speaker1: there isn't.
speaker2: please... he's my friend.

speaker1: and he slips away while we argue. 
speaker2: you'd never be able to trust me. if i got a chance for payback i'd take it.
speaker1: yes or no?
speaker1: you have good blood.
speaker1: lift your hands.
speaker1: get used to pain. more lies ahead.
speaker1: the blood flows into your left arm and out of your right. do you feel it? getting near your heart?
speaker1: almost there.

speaker1: lick your fingers. vampire spit will stop wounds from bleeding. 
speaker2: how'd we get here?
speaker1: it's called flitting. which room is your friend in?

speaker1: we're in time. he still has a few minutes left. 
speaker2: what's happening?
speaker1: he was near death. the journey back is not pleasant. what do you know about him, this boy with bad blood?
speaker2: he's my friend.
speaker1: hmm... who's his father?
speaker2: never met him. i don't think steve ever did either. why do you want to know?
speaker3: darren?
speaker1: will you come with me now or do you have things to set in order first?

speaker1: i see... 
speaker1: run if you want. it won't help. you're a creature of the night now, darren shan.

speaker1: darren... wake up, honey. 
speaker1: i just got off the phone. great news. steve's going to be okay.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: the hospital says it's a miracle.
speaker1: yeah, it's great news. i know how you feel.

speaker1: boo! 
speaker1: got you! i finally got you! -
speaker2: don't ever do that again.

speaker1: .doctor said it was a miracle. they say i'm unique -- 
speaker1: hey, darren. i've been looking for you. we got a lot to talk about.

speaker1: yeah? 
speaker2: but first...
speaker2: welcome to cirque du steve. what happens to us all can happen to any of us. if you watch, it's by your own free will. say farewell...
speaker3: .to crepsley the mouse.

speaker1: it's cruel. 
speaker2: it's nature. anyhow don't watch.
speaker2: and don't blink; you might miss it. steve sets the mouse in the terrarium.

speaker1: what happened to the spider? 
speaker2: i killed it.
speaker1: i had a dream. you and crepsley were in my hospital room...
speaker2: tell me about it later.
speaker1: i'll tell you now.
speaker2: i said later.

speaker1: darren! wait up! 
speaker1: can i walk home with you?
speaker2: got you something.

speaker1: hey. that's king. 
speaker2: no it's not. king's my buddy.
speaker1: that's king, darren. it is.
speaker2: come on.

speaker1: how was school today? 
speaker2: the usual. sometimes it was boring, sometimes really boring.

speaker1: hello? hey! 
speaker2: the darkness isn't so scary anymore, is it?
speaker1: i'm starting to think it's me that's scary.
speaker1: it's only gonna get worse, isn't it? there's no way back, is there? no magic potion to make me human again?
speaker1: we made a deal. i won't run away again.
speaker2: it's neither here nor there, but, i do feel sorry for you.
speaker2: are you ready then? the night is young. we can make many miles.
speaker1: i can't just -- my family, i can't let them think i just left them. or that something happened to me. my mother would... she couldn't...
speaker2: there's only one thing for it.

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: we'll have to kill you.

speaker1: i'm going to bed. 
speaker1: i love you both. i don't say it that much, but i do.
speaker2: we love you, too. don't we, tommy?
speaker3: of course we do.
speaker1: good night.
speaker3: kids. who knows how they think?

speaker1: shut up. 
speaker1: this is my home and i'm never gonna see it again, so don't rush me.
speaker1: hold onto this for me, okay?
speaker1: you're sure it will work?
speaker2: your heart will slow down so drastically they won't find a pulse. with the fall from the window, they'll think you're dead.
speaker1: what if i break bones?
speaker2: even better. they'll mend in a few days. vampires don't stay broken for long and it takes a very long fall to kill one.
speaker1: and the funeral home? won't they embalm me or something?
speaker2: don't worry. i have ways of making my thoughts become the thoughts of others. they'll leave you alone.

speaker1: my dad's allergic to grass. it's my job to cut the lawn. 
speaker2: you have a new job now. drink.
speaker1: so this is destiny, huh? tastes like crap.
speaker2: your breathing is slowing, your heart as well. do you feel it?
speaker2: you may be aware of what's going on around you. remember, the grief that you hear will be a release for those who express it.

speaker1: no, no, come on -- 
speaker1: hey -- hey, kid --

speaker1: darren? darren! 
speaker2: darren! oh my

speaker1: cause of death is trauma from the impact of the fall. poor kid. 
speaker2: are we doing an autopsy?

speaker1: not on a child. 
speaker2: i'm not going to cut open a kid.

speaker1: he's still cute. 
speaker2: i always had a crush on him.
speaker3: for the next life, shan. top right corner every time.
speaker4: i love you, darren. you said it the other night; i didn't say it back.

speaker1: on your feet. 
speaker2: my legs are asleep.

speaker1: what are you doing here? 
speaker2: vampire hunting.
speaker1: what do you have against vampires?
speaker2: yeah, i wanted to, but you did. you stole my dream. you stole my destiny.
speaker1: are you crazy? i did it to save your life. that was the deal. me for you.

speaker1: liar. you told him i was evil. you planned this all along. and you'll pay! you'll pay -- 
speaker2: i want you to leave...
speaker2: i want you to leave and forget you ever saw me. understand?
speaker1: i'm going to hunt you, darren. you and the other one. crepsley. i'll put a stake in you and burn you to ashes. i'll make sure you never come back from the grave again.
speaker3: if we ever meet again, i will show you loneliness you cannot imagine.
speaker3: do you still question his blood?
speaker2: would a stake through the heart kill a vampire?
speaker3: yes. but so would getting hit by a truck if it was going fast enough.

speaker1: he'll be trouble before it's over. 
speaker2: before what's over?
speaker1: this adventure we're on. shall we start?
speaker1: you'll get used to it after awhile. vampires are always saying goodbye.
speaker2: let's go.

speaker1: how's that? dark enough? 
speaker2: better.
speaker1: it's sunrise.
speaker2: i know the time. i know more about the sunrise than anyone alive.

speaker1: yes, sunlight would kill me. my electrons are different than a human's. but it would take several hours of exposure. i'd have plenty of time to kill you before i closed the curtains and went back to bed. crepsley pulls the blanket up over his head. 
speaker2: as darren considers this...

speaker1: we can die violently. accidentally or otherwise. but we also grow old. a full vampire will age one year for every ten human years he's alive. a half-vampire like you: one for every five. 
speaker2: i don't understand.
speaker1: i was born in 1774. i became --

speaker1: should we do the math or not? 
speaker1: i became a vampire when i was 20 years old. in 1794.

speaker1: math. 1794. so i've been a vampire now for 211 years. hmm? 
speaker1: i age 1 year for every 10, so, 211 divided by 10, i've aged about 21 years in that time. that 21 plus my first human 20 makes me look about 40.
speaker2: but altogether you're 211 plus 20.
speaker1: exactly. you're going to be a teenager for a very long time.
speaker2: where do you keep your car anyhow?
speaker1: what car?
speaker2: the one you were driving around my town in. the old black one.
speaker1: i've never owned a car, darren. i don't need one.
speaker2: it was near school one day. it followed me home a few days later.
speaker1: and you saw me behind the wheel?
speaker2: i couldn't see who was driving.
speaker1: it wasn't me.

speaker1: there... 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: dinner.

speaker1: go. run. 
speaker1: did you kill her?
speaker2: i put her to sleep. she'll be like this 15 minutes. when she wakes up, she won't remember a thing.

speaker1: will she become a vampire? 
speaker2: no. she'd have to share y blood for that to happen.
speaker1: don't take too much.
speaker2: a vampire who feeds often can control himself. one who drinks only when he must can end up feeding wildly.
speaker2: the hunger inside us must be fed to be controlled. to be civilized. it's what separates us from... the others.
speaker1: what others?
speaker2: your turn.
speaker1: no. i won't.
speaker2: darren...
speaker1: i'll never do it.
speaker2: you can lead a vampire to blood, but you can't make him drink.
speaker1: i'm only half-vampire.

speaker1: no matter, you need blood to live now. you'll drink eventually. when you're hungry enough. 
speaker2: i'll die first.
speaker1: don't be stupid. you may abstain tonight, but you must feed soon.
speaker2: what is it?
speaker1: nothing. let's go.
speaker2: something out there scares you.
speaker1: the thought of spending another minute with you.

speaker1: we still need to eat food, too. i just don't need it tonight. 
speaker1: now what?

speaker1: the blood... i wanted it. i wanted to drink it. 
speaker2: of course you did! you're a
speaker2: i'm sorry. it was wrong of me to blood you. you're too young. but it's done. like the entire history of the world up to this moment.
speaker1: thank you.
speaker2: eat. let's not waste anymore food tonight.
speaker1: the car...
speaker3: as he looks back over his shoulder at the door.

speaker1: darren shan, we meet at last. 
speaker1: you're quite a boy. sacrificed everything to save a friend.
speaker2: where'd you hear that?
speaker1: a little bat told me.
speaker1: oh, he's still here.
speaker2: who is?
speaker1: crepsley. trying to stay alive.
speaker1: would you like to see?
speaker2: see what? the air seems to buzz as something 'passes'.
speaker1: why the fight of course. boys like to watch fights, don't they?

speaker1: it's behind us! 
speaker2: closes regardless, relentless, death in his eyes.

speaker1: are you okay? 
speaker2: my arm's broken. but it should be fine in a day or two.

speaker1: who were they? vampires? 
speaker2: no. the one with the watch was mr.
speaker1: how dangerous can a man named mr.
speaker2: who said he was a man?
speaker1: then what is he?
speaker2: mr. tiny can't be explained. he needs to be experienced.
speaker1: and the purple guy. what was he?
speaker2: a vampaneze.
speaker1: yeah? keep talking.
speaker2: long ago humans were looked upon as animals by some vampires. cattle to be slaughtered. laws were passed to forbid needless killing. it made it easier to pass unnoticed among humans if we didn't murder them. most vampires obeyed...
speaker1: but some didn't?

speaker1: seventy vampires broke away, declared themselves a separate race. the vampaneze. over time their appearance changed, their numbers grew. they believe it's wrong to feed from a human without killing it. 
speaker2: what? that's crazy.
speaker1: they believe those of us who feed in small amounts live like leeches. in shame. it led to war.
speaker1: the last one nearly destroyed us all. there's been a truce for many years now.
speaker1: will you be alright while i sleep?
speaker2: oh yeah... this is so much better than where i used to be...
speaker1: what do you think of rejoining the cirque du freak? until you get on your vampire feet so to speak.
speaker2: half vampire.
speaker1: yes, yes. three-eighths if you want. what do you think?

speaker1: show time in twenty minutes. someone tell rhamus to get his stomachs in gear! 
speaker1: larten'crepsley! as i live and breathe. i thought it would be years before i saw you again.
speaker1: darren shan. you've come a long way since the last time i saw you.
speaker2: i liked it better where i was.
speaker1: i'm sure.
speaker3: do you still have my coffin?
speaker1: of course. you're really back?
speaker1: perhaps you could do the show tonight? a few of us are absent or ill this evening.
speaker3: i'd be delighted.
speaker1: mr. shan will have to pull his weight as well. i'll give him to evra. evra! evra!
speaker1: i hope i haven't gone from one unreliable boy to two.

speaker1: evra, my industrious wonder. here is darren. put him to work with you. show him the snakey ropes. 
speaker1: off with you. go!
speaker1: you blooded a child, larten? what were you thinking?
speaker2: you don't approve?
speaker1: i don't matter. what will the vampire generals say when they hear about it?
speaker2: i'm no longer part of their domain.
speaker1: so you say. they may disagree.

speaker1: what do you do? me? i'm a snake boy. i do a whole snake thing. 
speaker2: do you eat mice?
speaker1: big macs actually.

speaker1: i caught your act in the last town. 
speaker2: thanks. i'm not doing it tonight.
speaker1: snakes can catch cold?
speaker2: still gotta work the floor though. ushers. we get the seats filled.
speaker1: who are they all?
speaker2: the backbone of cirque du freak. they do the driving, the tent pitching, the potato peeling even.
speaker1: how did they end up here?
speaker2: most wandered in. if mr. tall likes them, they stay.

speaker1: can we help you find a seat? 
speaker2: are there any left?
speaker1: only the best seats in the house.
speaker2: you guys are with the cirque?
speaker3: cirque is french, right? are you guys french?
speaker1: oui. vous etes observateur. nous sommes les serpents frangais.
speaker2: cool... i'm debbie, this is sam.
speaker1: evra von.

speaker1: oh, i'm darren. 
speaker2: is the show great? say yes. we had to sneak out to see it.
speaker1: i snuck out to see it once, too. and i'm still here. an odd, almost spooky moment. is he serious?
speaker3: good one, darren. hey. debbie and darren. like bonnie and clyde. and their friend evra von what?
speaker3: dude, it looks like the kind of suit you'd wear to a funeral.
speaker1: you have no idea...

speaker1: how long have you known mr. tall? 
speaker2: five years.

speaker1: how do you meet someone like him? 
speaker2: i was raised in a circus, but not a nice one like this. the owner used to beat me and keep me in a glass cage. i felt like a useless freak. one night i looked out of my cage and saw mr. tall just standing there. he watched me until the owner came over and asked if he could help him. mr. tall grabbed him by the throat and strangled him to death. then he opened the cage and said, "let's go, evra." he named me that. i added the von. i've been with him ever since.
speaker3: darren...
speaker4: how do you feel about show business?

speaker1: to be poisoned by a spider may be my fate. 
speaker2: as she realizes it's darren. cool.

speaker1: almost done. 
speaker2: darren...

speaker1: i'm not going to sleep here. we'll find a nook in the factory. 
speaker2: mattress.
speaker3: i just felt sick for a second.
speaker1: you need blood.

speaker1: you think mr. tiny might come? 
speaker1: who is he? what does he want?
speaker2: what we want is who we are, don't you think?
speaker1: can't you give me a straight answer just once?!
speaker2: you won't learn by me telling you. you must live some things to know what they are.
speaker2: okay. why do you like spiders?

speaker1: did you ever think there was a particular reason? 
speaker2: no. i never thought about it.
speaker1: that's the trouble with children.
speaker2: i'm not a child.
speaker1: are you a man? if you're not a man, you're a child.
speaker2: i'm in between.
speaker1: in between does not exist!
speaker1: i'll sleep in here tonight. but sit outside the van tomorrow and make it look like i'm there. it's just caution. old habits die hard.
speaker3: and old vampires?
speaker1: gavner purl, as always i heard you coming from a mile away.

speaker1: we'll call it a draw then. 
speaker2: it's been too long, larten.
speaker3: decades now.
speaker4: you guys are friends?
speaker2: i suppose. we once shared a coffin together. for six months.
speaker4: like roommates? to save money?
speaker2: we were being hunted.
speaker4: who was hunting you?
speaker3: never mind. darren, gavner purl.
speaker2: a half-vampire?
speaker3: of course. we don't make full vampires of our assistants.
speaker2: nor do we make assistants of children.

speaker1: gavner purl 
speaker1: a child, larten? why?!
speaker2: i have my reasons.
speaker3: and they are?
speaker2: i don't owe answers to vampires anymore. i'm exiled from our kind
speaker3: self-exiled. and i at least am owed an answer.
speaker2: all i care to say is a boy sought me out, knew who i was. he asked me to make him my assistant.
speaker3: and how did you know --
speaker2: it wasn't darren. another boy. his blood was bad. i should have killed him, but i didn't.
speaker2: i met darren shortly after. his blood was good or i certainly would have killed him.
speaker3: how could a boy find you?
speaker3: tiny?

speaker1: he tried to kill us. 
speaker2: he tried to kill me. what he wanted with you wasn't determined.
speaker3: perhaps you chose the wrong boy. in mr. tiny's eyes.
speaker1: what are you guys talking about!?
speaker2: what's important enough to track down an exile? what is your news?
speaker3: war.
speaker2: i'm not interested in your wars.
speaker3: well the other side is interested or they wouldn't be trying to get rid of you.
speaker2: i've had enough killing! no more! you've come to the wrong place. i am the wrong place...
speaker3: even so, i'm glad you're alive.
speaker2: the sun is coming. will you stay?
speaker3: i can still make miles. the war won't wait. and neither will bad news. i have to go.

speaker1: then travel safely. 
speaker2: would you mind if i walk a bit with your assistant?
speaker1: take him with you if you want.

speaker1: you look sick. doesn't larten feed you? 
speaker2: i won't drink blood if that's what you mean. i promised myself.
speaker1: why?
speaker2: you'll get insulted.
speaker2: i'm afraid if i drink blood, i'll become evil.
speaker1: the only thing drinking blood will do to you is keep you alive.
speaker2: that's how it would start. i would swear it was just to stay alive. but what'll i turn into? you're on one side of the fence or the other. my father used to say that and now i know what he meant.

speaker1: you've already turned, darren. you need to accept what you've already become. there's no going back. 
speaker2: why did crepsley make himself an exile anyhow?
speaker1: he was tired of all the killing.
speaker2: with the vampaneze?
speaker1: crepsley was once a vampire general. one of our great leaders. he may seem reluctant, but i assure you, no one is as skilled at killing vampaneze than crepsley is. i think that's why they'd like to get him out of the way. kill him off before the new war starts.
speaker2: you've known him a long time?
speaker1: i was his assistant. he blooded me, as he blooded you.
speaker2: why'd he choose you?
speaker1: to teach me to kill vampaneze. up until now, it's the only reason he ever chooses anyone.
speaker2: is it why he chose me?

speaker1: that's for crepsley to say. not me. 
speaker1: do you know what the biggest danger is to a vampire, darren?
speaker2: the vampaneze? mr. tiny?
speaker1: no. it's that they live so long they no longer care. everything they love is left behind until they finally have nothing left to live for. except death. the fact that he's taken an apprentice seems, to me, a good sign. a sign that he's thinking of living not dying.
speaker2: lucky for me. glad i could help.
speaker1: a clear run. good.
speaker1: stay by him, darren. stay by him.
speaker2: that part is definitely cool.

speaker1: what's up? 
speaker2: nothing.
speaker1: it's smells like burnt hair.
speaker2: don't know. i'm congested.
speaker2: hey...
speaker3: debbie and sam ducking inside the factory.
speaker4: exchange a look. start after them.

speaker1: you should see the look on your faces. 
speaker2: what're you doing here?
speaker1: we could ask you the same thing. we come here all the time. my grandfather used to work here.
speaker3: must've been a long time ago.
speaker1: he says now it's like one of those bombed out world war ii cathedrals. empty of what is used to be.
speaker4: hey, we loved the show, man. it was off the hook.
speaker2: off the hook, huh? i'll tell all the freaks you said so.
speaker4: are you guys on your own? just traveling. no parents or nothing?
speaker3: no. no parents.
speaker4: school?
speaker2: no school either.

speaker1: you're the luckiest guys on earth. 
speaker2: you have to be different to be here.
speaker3: different how?
speaker4: everyone has a place they belong.
speaker3: i think your skin is beautiful.
speaker3: can i touch it?
speaker3: wow. has it always been this way?
speaker2: he's a snake-boy.
speaker3: you shouldn't call him names because he looks different.
speaker4: it's okay. i am a snake boy.
speaker1: you could say you're dermatologically challenged.
speaker3: what about you, darren? how are you different?

speaker1: i get scared easy. 
speaker1: how'd you get up there anyhow?
speaker2: you mean, how did a girl get up there?

speaker1: hey, be careful. 
speaker2: don't worry. she's like a gymnast.
speaker3: you're crazy!
speaker4: how about you?
speaker3: i got nothing to prove.
speaker4: but it'd be easier for you than me.
speaker3: why's that?
speaker4: because chickens have wings.

speaker1: let's play mirrors. 
speaker2: what's that?
speaker1: i do something and you have to copy me. like this.
speaker3: come on, guys...
speaker1: there definitely something different about you. i just can't figure it out.
speaker2: is sam your boyfriend?

speaker1: he's my cousin. 
speaker2: oh...
speaker2: we should get off this.

speaker1: hold on. 
speaker2: i don't think it'll hold you, dude.
speaker3: thanks for the heads up... bro.
speaker4: it's okay. i'm okay.
speaker1: i don't know how you hung on. i couldn't have.
speaker4: you wouldn't have fallen in the first place... i just got dizzy.

speaker1: maybe you need to eat something. 
speaker2: well, the food's down on ground level. let's get out of here.
speaker3: she's kind'of cool, huh? i mean, for a girl.
speaker2: i like her. she asks a lot of questions though.
speaker3: she's just curious.
speaker2: there's no such thing as 'just' with a girl.
speaker3: what makes you such an expert?
speaker2: my snake's a girl.

speaker1: good morning, darren. 
speaker2: what's good about it?

speaker1: he stops as sam and debbie catch up with him. 
speaker2: hey, darren. hi...
speaker1: you guys are coming to the show again tonight?
speaker3: of course. evra's doing his snake act tonight.
speaker1: oh, you came to see evra.
speaker3: and you...
speaker4: i was hoping for amanda bynes.
speaker1: hey, i'll catch up with you later.

speaker1: they watch as darren heads off. 
speaker2: he's gonna be gone in another day or two. tonight's the last show.
speaker3: i know that. so?
speaker2: so stop looking at him like you love him.
speaker3: you're such an sam.
speaker4: darren joins crepsley, a little unsteady.
speaker5: look at you. you can barely stand.
speaker6: i'm fine.
speaker5: you need to feed. you need blood..
speaker6: no! i won't let you hunt some poor person down for me. i --

speaker1: no need to hunt. there's someone here willing to save you. 
speaker2: by my own free will, darren shan.

speaker1: drink or you'll die. 
speaker2: no. i can't. i'm human.
speaker1: you're not! and you'll be nothing!
speaker2: i am human. in my heart i am.

speaker1: an usher in the house of usher. and i can't seem to find a seat. 
speaker2: this way.
speaker3: join me.
speaker2: i don't think so.

speaker1: it's time we had a few moments. folks involved in epic struggles should get to know each other. 
speaker1: has crepsley told you about me?
speaker2: he said you can't be explained.
speaker1: he gives me too much credit.
speaker3: hey, darren.
speaker3: we're gonna sit on this side.
speaker4: cuz we miss you so much.
speaker1: choosing sides can only lead to trouble. never, ever choose sides unless it's your own.
speaker2: you've chosen the vampaneze.
speaker1: is that really what you think? a smart boy like you?

speaker1: a white spot shines down on mr. tall. 
speaker2: ladies and gentlemen...

speaker1: .subjugators and saps... 
speaker2: welcome to the cirque du freak. we are an ancient circus...
speaker1: oh, his speeches are impossible.
speaker1: i'm not so complicated, darren. during war there are those who profit. a war between vampires and vampaneze would have terrible consequences. therefore...
speaker3: terrible profits.
speaker1: excellent. i am a profiteer. i exact fees and gains. i'm simple.
speaker1: did crepsley tell you of the prophesy?
speaker3: what prophesy?

speaker1: they say the final battle between vampires and vampaneze will be decided by a child. that's why the vampires won't blood children. to avoid the end of the world. 
speaker1: i think i underestimated you. i think you could be wonderful.
speaker2: i think you're a creep. i think you suck.
speaker1: too bad.
speaker3: he was great!
speaker4: is it dar-wren's girlfriend?
speaker2: forget about her --
speaker4: she has plenty of lovely blood inside. inside, outside, hmmm?
speaker4: i don't care about humans. i don't care about you. but the vampire - larten crepsley - him i care about.
speaker4: murlough is a vampire killer.

speaker1: on stage: the spotlight hits crepsley. 
speaker2: you guys are in trouble. there's more than one vampire now. gavner purl is here.
speaker3: have you seen purl gavner's face?
speaker4: darren, you're a liar. he's a thousand miles gone by now. and master crepsley is right there.

speaker1: shimmers, phases into flit mode. disappears. 
speaker2: crepsley! look out!
speaker3: as murlough 'appears' alongside crepsley.

speaker1: crepsley will come for his assistant. 
speaker2: he doesn't care about me.
speaker1: murlough has an assistant, too. a smart one, smarter than you.
speaker2: steve?
speaker3: mr. tiny made my dream come true. only better. i'm half vampaneze instead of a stupid half vampire. mr. tiny says i have a destiny. he says he's gonna make sure of it.
speaker2: is that who you talked to? was that the internet guy? mr. tiny?
speaker3: pretty funny, huh? he introduced himself after you left town.

speaker1: but, i think i've known him a long time in my head. in my bad, bad blood. 
speaker1: he gave me back the dream you stole.
speaker2: crepsley comes.

speaker1: where'd he go? 
speaker2: evra... get them out of here.

speaker1: you guys better go back. 
speaker2: what are you gonna do?
speaker1: darren's my friend.

speaker1: crepsley speaks to 'the room'. 
speaker2: i can smell it. why does it hide?
speaker2: the vampire is here.
speaker3: the vampire will die.

speaker1: sam, unhook his legs. 
speaker2: are you guys nuts? get outta here!
speaker1: it's against our code.
speaker1: never leave a freak behind.

speaker1: come on! 
speaker2: evra. i think i'm dying.
speaker3: let's carry him if we have to.
speaker1: it's okay. it's the wolfman. he's in his cage.
speaker1: no don't!
speaker4: ooops...

speaker1: oh sam. oh no... darren crawls over, takes sam's hand. 
speaker2: go save debbie, darren...
speaker2: i think she loves you...
speaker1: forgive me, sam, but i need strength. i need blood.
speaker1: we're going to save her together.

speaker1: is crepsley dead? 
speaker2: who knows? young murlough lives, but he's hurt.
speaker1: what can i do?
speaker2: what can dar-wren's girlfriend do? we need to get the blood inside outside. don't we?

speaker1: let her go. 
speaker2: stop being a big shot. this isn't like stopping some fight at school.
speaker1: shut up, steve.

speaker1: murlough's eyes go very, very dark. he attacks. 
speaker2: you need to stand still so you can die.

speaker1: stay back! or i'll throw her off! i mean it! 
speaker2: it's over, steve.
speaker1: is it?
speaker1: you wanna hear something funny? after your funeral, i went to see your parents.
speaker1: and they were fine. they acted like they barely remembered you.
speaker2: liar.

speaker1: and your sister. she was moving into your room. they had a yard sale. i bought some of your stuff. 
speaker2: did you steal money from my mom's purse?
speaker1: what?
speaker2: did you?
speaker1: why do you ask? is knowing that gonna help you rest in peace?
speaker2: no. it's just practically the last thing that ever happened between me and my dad was i was arguing with him.
speaker1: least you had a dad to argue with.
speaker2: i was telling him he was wrong about you. that's the last time we had together. fighting about you.
speaker1: hate to tell ya. your dad was right. how do you think we got the money for the tickets? i took it. just like i'm gonna take you.

speaker1: wham! darren lets steve have it. 
speaker2: i miss him.

speaker1: i miss him so much. 
speaker2: kill him, darren. do it now so you won't have to do it later.
speaker1: no. he used to be my friend.
speaker1: start running. don't ever stop.
speaker3: next time... and he's gone. disappearing into the dark.
speaker4: sam?

speaker1: are you gonna be okay? 
speaker2: i just need to catch my breath.
speaker1: you think i made a mistake, don't you?
speaker2: no. i think that you proved yourself human after all.
speaker1: half human. what now?
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: there's a war on, isn't there?
speaker1: this world is crossed by fences. you have to decide which side you stand on.
speaker2: yes, yes. black and white fences crossing very gray fields.
speaker1: it's not gray. i've met the bad guys. they need to be stopped.
speaker2: i'm not sure it's my fight.
speaker1: but you said it. there's no in between. and the power of being alone is never going to be greater than the weakness. it's our fight.

speaker1: he was a good kid. it's weird, but i remember things about him even though i wasn't there when they happened. even though it's impossible. 
speaker2: his blood is in you.
speaker3: i'll deal with the police when they come. what i'll say, i don't know.
speaker4: say what happened. some crazy guy showed up. sam was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
speaker5: he was brave.
speaker4: for the only time in his life.
speaker1: he didn't die in vain.

speaker1: time to fly or flit or whatever you call it. the sun won't wait all night. 
speaker2: actually, that's exactly what it does.
speaker1: time will tell what this night has brought us.
speaker2: yes. keep my coffin ready, would you?
speaker1: always.
speaker3: do you think we'll meet again?
speaker4: you never know.
speaker3: i hope so...
speaker4: hope is a good word. i hope so, too.
speaker4: where are we going?
speaker2: to meet the vampire generals. war clouds are forming. a storm is coming. and i have a feeling you're needed much more than i am.

speaker1: so what are we waiting for? let's go. 
speaker2: take my arm. darren shakes his head, doesn't need it. he shimmers, flits into the night.
