EDDIE: let's beat it, man. i don't like being up here.
NICK: what, scared of heights?
EDDIE: i dunno, man. after what happened to johnny gobs --
NICK: look, johnny gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right? no big loss.
EDDIE: that ain't what i heard. that ain't what i heard at all. i heard the bat got him.
NICK: gimme a break, will you? shut up...
EDDIE: five stories, straight down. there was
EDDIE: there was no blood, man. my brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and
NICK: no wonder you're such a chickenshit.
NICK: do you want this money or

JACK NAPIER: decent people shouldn't live here. they'd be much happier someplace else. 
ALICIA: anything new?
JACK: the usual gas. if this clown could lay a hand on grissom... i would've had to kill him by now.
ALICIA: if grissom knew about
ALICIA: you look just fine, jack.
JACK: ... i didn't ask.

MEDIC: that one there won't say a word. the other one's raving his head off. 
ECKHARDT: variety, huh? the spice of life.

PATROLMAN: they found him hugging a drainpipe. 
KNOX: great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what? 'cause if so, it's the third one this week.
PATROLMAN: i dunno. what's "what"?
KNOX: good answer. i'm gonna put you in for a commendation.
ECKHARDT: oh christ, it's knox.
KNOX: hiya, gents. this anything i should know about?
ECKHARDT: nothing out of the routine.
NICK: a
KNOX: come on. one question. is there a six-foot bat in gotham city?
ECKHARDT: we had another bat sighting.
JACK: i'm sure that was vitally important. listen: things are heating up. someone is leaking information to harvey dent.
ECKHARDT: i'm doing the best i can. if it's a problem --
JACK: eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
ECKHARDT: i'll work on it.
JACK: very nice, lieutenant. but a little ostentatious on a cop's salary, don't you think?
ECKHARDT: i answer to grissom, punk. not to you.
JACK: you're a smart boy, eckhardt. you should be thinking about the future.
ECKHARDT: ambition. forget it, jack. you'll never run that organization.
JACK: and why's that?
ECKHARDT: you're a psycho, friend. you're an a-one crazy boy and grissom knows it.
JACK: here. use mine.

COLLEAGUE: hey knox, you got a visitor. 
KNOX: i'm real busy, clark. be a pal and dust him, okay?
COLLEAGUE: this one you might want to dust yourself.
KNOX: ... vicki vale.
VICKI: how'd you know it was me?
KNOX: honey -- i would know any randomly selected
KNOX: a girl could get hurt doing this.
VICKI: i do get hurt.
KNOX: got any more of those?
VICKI: nothing i'm at liberty to reveal here. what's new and hot in gotham city?
KNOX: it's too good, vick. we got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
VICKI: evildoers, huh? big or small?
KNOX: small so far. i mean -- they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they.
VICKI: speaking of which... i hear the notorious bruce wayne is throwing a big do for the harvey dent campaign.
KNOX: yeah. hottest ticket in town. every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there.
VICKI: no.
KNOX: well, i'm starving. will you at least buy me a hamburger?
VICKI: yes, but please -- be gentle. overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm.

JACK: we can always pop him. -- or pop someone close to him. 
LIEUTENANT: let's feed him to the bat.
GRISSOM: he's going after our front companies. specifically ace chemical. which would tie us in with councilman kane, senator miller... on up the line. we have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down.
LIEUTENANT: how do we go? the usual fire?
GRISSOM: i'm thinking break-in. trash the office, remove the relevant documents...
JACK: "industrial espionage."
GRISSOM: that's right. and jack -- i'd like you to handle this operation personally.
JACK: ...
JACK: why do you need

ALFRED: i'd say about thirty feet, sir. 
KNOX: you know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
ALFRED: which bathroom is that, air?
KNOX: the small one.
GORDON: knox, for the ninth time, and you can quote me --
KNOX: mr. dent. what's

KNOX: holy 
KNOX: likes to kill?
VICKI: women find him magnetic.
KNOX: i bet they like him for his big charity balls.
VICKI: that, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
KNOX: well, you know me. the more they've got, the less they're worth. this guy must be the most worthless man in america.
BRUCE WAYNE: you disappoint me. why not the world?
BRUCE: bruce wayne. -- i've read your work.
KNOX: great. give me a grant.
BRUCE: i might consider it if you introduce me to miss vale.
KNOX: "this is miss vale." --
VICKI: that's intriguing. they haven't been
KNOX: some people think she has
VICKI: as far as i know.
BRUCE: good. then with any luck we'll run into each other.
ALFRED: excuse me, sir. commissioner gordon was compelled to leave --
KNOX: i know the rich are different, but that guy is
KNOX: what were you thinking?
VICKI: yum, yum.
KNOX: well,

GORDON: good lord, it we could put our hands on jack napier... why wasn't i told about this? who's in charge of the -- 
PATROLMAN: lt. eckhardt, sir.

HOOD I: just like the file cabinets. 
HOOD II: i don't get it. if this place is cleaned out already, what do we need five men?
GORDON: you men are dismissed. we'll take over from here. any man who opens fire on jack napier... will answer to me. eckhardt tries to slink off. gordon grabs him roughly. gordon you. stick around.
GORDON: i'm in charge here. not carl grissom.

KNOX: commissioner. do us both a favor. 
KNOX: bruce wayne? date? he called you up and asked you for a date?...
KNOX: yeah. "mister one-nighter." because that's the average length of his relationships with women.
MIRANDA: the current record is almost two weeks. that cover girl -- what's her name? you must've shot her, vicki --
KNOX: tell her about the peanuts.
VICKI: peanuts?
KNOX: yeah. peanuts. which is how he goes through
VICKI: plain or roasted? alex, i'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
KNOX: why? aw, come on, vicki, i'm a reporter. i'm curious. i do this for a living.
VICKI: i told him yes.
KNOX: miranda, i'm busy. go be productive.

BRUCE: too much work. i'm not really the physical type. -- thank you, alfred. 
VICKI: you do a very convincing imitation. mm, this is tasty. what's yours?
BRUCE: two drinks and i start swinging from the rooftops. tell me, vicki. there's something i'm very curious about. what took you down to corto maltese?
VICKI: ... i guess i needed a change.
BRUCE: you were one of the most successful magazine photographers in the city.
VICKI: have you ever been to corto maltese?
BRUCE: not since the shooting started.
VICKI: we went there once when i was little. i played on the beach. and at nights -- they had a band -- i danced with my father on the hotel patio. that was corto maltese. when the war broke out i had to go back. and i promised myself that this time... i wouldn't look away.
BRUCE: what did you see?
VICKI: ... terror.
BRUCE: there's terror everywhere. some types are just more --
BRUCE: insulation?
VICKI: bruce, really, when i say these things i don't mean to criticize
VICKI: i'm happy to talk about something else. i don't want to be depressing.
VICKI: i'm sorry, bruce, i have to ask. are you like this with the other women you know? -- because i just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
BRUCE: vicki, if i say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, i think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how i'll mean it. bingo. the guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's also rather touchingly, almost childishly,

VICKI: you 
VICKI: ... we could try that.

JACK: it's me. "sugar bumps." 
GRISSOM: jack? thank i can't believe it's you.
JACK: is that what you "heard"?
JACK: i've died once already. it wasn't so bad. -- in fact i

ALICIA: ... the rent? paid? 
GANG BOSS: so why don't we hear this from grissom?
RACKETEER: i got something i'd like to know.
ROTELLI: and what happens if we say no?
JOKER: nobody wants a war, carmine. if we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
ROTELLI: that's it?
JOKER: that's it.
CRIMELORD: ... you're

BRUCE: i said i'd call you the minute i got free. and i did. -- and here we are. 
VICKI: hm hmm. lunch. not even dinner.
BRUCE: vicki. do you want the whole truth? all coyness aside? i wish i had more time to give you. every day i don't see you, i miss you. now. are you going to waste this lovely afternoon being all mad at me?
VICKI: okay, i'm a you sound so much like someone i used to... bruce? i know this is silly, but -- you're not
BRUCE: ... looks like a

BRUCE: oh my are you all right? 
JOKER: all

VICKI: oh my i've seen this picture. 
KNOX: i guess so. pulitzer prize, 1963.
VICKI: his face. allie, look at his face.
KNOX: something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
KNOX: he walks out on his own party. half an hour later, the caped crusader turns up in full bat-drag. sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. no place to
KNOX: oh? why is that, vicki?
VICKI: he's best friends with jim gordon and harvey dent. they would
KNOX: your little chum is out of his mind. next time you call him up and he can't go

JOKER: mmm. how'd you find it? 
VOICE ON PHONE: called her agent.
VICKI: not to me. i need a job.
CLAIRE: now vicki. everyone
CLAIRE: oh. really.

VICKI: i won't let you have it. the batman is amused. he smiles menacingly. vicki i know you can break my neck and take it. but the joker's on that same roll. i --
BATMAN: the joker is a murderer. and
BATMAN: all right, here's a compromise. i'll develop the photos. you keep the jokers and i'll keep the rest.
VICKI: how do i know you won't keep them all?
BATMAN: because i'll take you with me.
