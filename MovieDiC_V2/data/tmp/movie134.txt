KOSALAS: yeah, that's how it went down.
EDDIE: stay here. take care of your partner.

VICTOR: call luis. the lab technicians arrive. 
KOBAS: get these people back out of here, wouldja.

CRAGIE: look, it's no big thing, kid. a friggin' dog and pony show. some questions by bureaucrats. "when's the last time you were at the range?" like that. 
KOSALAS: look. it was a accident. why can't you just be --
CRAGIE: you born yesterday?! these ain't cops. they'll roast our just cause we carry a badge. both of us. we stick together on this, kid. we're partners, right?

EDDIE: we're jerking off here.

SANCHEZ: let's cut the cusack. 
SANCHEZ: option 1: you can send em downtown. if judge collins didn't get laid last night, you can probably get him to arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway. he'll set bail. i'll take care of it. option 2: release them here and now and we'll call it a day. up to you.
EDDIE: i like to see you earn your money.

CRAGIE: we come up the back stairs. we start cleanin' the hallway when the deceased pops out of a doorway with a 25 automatic. i tell him to drop it, but he's comin. we had no choice. kosalas here saw the whole thing. 
KATES: did you?
KOSALAS: i was on another doorway...
KATES: but you saw the action?
KOSALAS: i saw him fall.

CRAGIE: hearing? who called for a hearing? the little tried to shoot me in the back!
KATES: ms. partida --
CRAGIE: that piece of
KATES: shut-up, cragie. partida has demanded a formal hearing. you will be under oath so the department will provide you with a lawyer unless you've got your own. an ops review board member is waiting to talk to you. doesn't sound like you got anything to worry about. cragie gets up. kosalas, sitting through this interview in stunned silence stands also.
KATES: kosalas, you work with cusack until this is over.
KOSALAS: yes sir.
EDDIE: i ain't got no time to nursmaid a rookie. i don't need a partner.
KATES: your right! you don't need a partner! you need a keeper! christ! how do i explain this one upstairs? we gave you 600 man-hours, you took a month planning the thing, and what have you got to show for it? nine bodies? a dead informant? one of my best men shot! for christ's sake! you're going to have me back on a beat busting perverts in the park.
EDDIE: we got a bigger problem. these comachos aren't gonna take this lying down. the animals are out of the cages.

EDDIE: i'm going to have to fix that. 
EDDIE: you know, it's kind of interesting. that 16 year old in the hallway with the gun? partida told me he doesn't have a record. the kid's never been arrested.
KOSALAS: yeah, well, you know, if you read the papers, cops only shoot honor students. sole support of the family and all that.

ENGINEER: ...after the gyros are locked, any movement of the hand controller is duplicated by the 'prowler.' 
ENGINEER: this simple control system means that even semi-skilled employees can operate the unit with a minimum of training. as they say, "even a child can operate it."
KATES: he's talking about you, cusack. pay attention. you're all gonna have to be qualified on this. it's the future.

KOSALAS: you know i really wanted to be a good cop, but... it's hard enough sometimes just to stay alive. comes so easy to you. you got all the answers. me, i'm still tryin' to find the questions.
KOSALAS: cragie planted the gun on the kid. just wasted him, and then i... i don't know what to do about the hearing tomorrow...
EDDIE: tell the truth.
KOSALAS: see. it's all so nothin' for you. if i talk straight every cop on the force will on me. if i don't... cragie gets away with murder.
EDDIE: and the chance to do it again. next time he might take away a cop. that make any difference?
KOSALAS: he's my partner.
EDDIE: your partner's selling you out, kosalas. he kills an unarmed kid, and now he's risking your to save his own.
KOSALAS: it was a mistake.
EDDIE: it cost an innocent kid his life.
KOSALAS: i know that! i know that!
KOSALAS: i see that kid's face every time i close my eyes.
EDDIE: tell 'em like it is, nick. i'll back you up.

CRAGIE: nice to see you out with the boys for a change, sarge. 
EDDIE: hello, cragie.
CRAGIE: they tell me my sergeant wouldn't sign for me. you want to tell me why?
EDDIE: you know why.
CRAGIE: no. tell me.
EDDIE: you were a good cop for a lot of years. you've passed your limit now cragie.
CRAGIE: you. where do you get off?
EDDIE: right about here.

PIRELLI: she's havin' a bad night. gave her a shot of brandy. maybe she'll sleep. 
EDDIE: giving liquor to a minor, pirelli?
EDDIE: i'll be back right after the hearing tomorrow, and you can get some sleep then.

DIANA: what do you do when you don't have anyone? 
EDDIE: you find someone.
DIANA: could you... hold me for a while?

MALE PANEL MEMBER: how far were you standing from where your grandson was shot, mrs. murillio? 
CLERK: in the next doorway. four meters.
DONATO: how you doin', sarge?
EDDIE: what's the score?
PARTIDA: officer cragie has already been sworn. officer cragie, you have heard mrs. murillio's testimony --
CRAGIE: yes, sir.
PARTIDA: you have heard her tell this panel that she saw you lay the gun in her grandson's hand.
CRAGIE: i'm not saying the woman would make this up. but there's no way she could have seen anything from where she was standing in a hallway that dark. like you said, she's the boy's grandmother.
PARTIDA: if it was dark, officer, how were you sure vega had a gun?
CRAGIE: we were lucky. there was a glint of light, a reflection comin off the barrel of the weapon.

DONATO: you think he'll get a pass? 
EDDIE: you heard it all. what do you think?
DONATO: if the hearing was over i'd have to put my money on the old lady. but kosalas's next. my bet's on cragie.
EDDIE: the kid may surprise you.

PARTIDA: and right after you heard officer cragie's gun discharge, what did you do then? 
KOSALAS: i immediately advanced down the hall.
PARTIDA: and what did you see?
KOSALAS: the deceased, vega, lying on the floor. officer cragie was checking his vital signs.
PARTIDA: what happened then?
KOSALAS: we recovered a .25 calibre automatic from the teenager's right hand.
PARTIDA: did you see that weapon in vega's hand before officer cragie fired?
KOSALAS: yes, sir. cragie leans back.
PARTIDA: no more questions.
PARTIDA: i'd like to now call sergeant cusack.

DIANA: you made that uniform look good. 
PIRELLI: that good looking gorilla next to me is eddie's father. better than good cop. killed in the line of duty.
'71.: another cop shot him. an accident.

EDDIE: i can't comment on that. it was over before i got there. 
PARTIDA: you are his superior officer, are you not?
EDDIE: cragie's in my unit, yes.
PARTIDA: did you give the men their various assignments?
EDDIE: i did.
PARTIDA: did you request that officer cragie be on your tac team?
EDDIE: no, i didn't.
PARTIDA: sergeant... i have here a department document dated 24 september, of last year. it is a request by you, to your superiors, to have officer cragie transferred to another unit. are you familiar with this document?
EDDIE: yes.
PARTIDA: why did you request his transfer?
EDDIE: maybe 30 years is too long for anyone to look at the city's guts, mr. partida.
PARTIDA: what happened to this request?
EDDIE: it was denied.
PARTIDA: this is a letter of support for officer cragie. everyone in his unit signed it but you. why?
EDDIE: i don't agree with what it says.
PARTIDA: are you saying you do not believe officer cragie is fit to work the streets of chicago?
EDDIE: that's what i'm saying.

EDDIE: i just dialed 348-6610, and i get this funny buzz. check the line for me? thanks. 
BRENNAN: seems to me the man's got his tongue stuck to his asshole, cragie.
CRAGIE: hey, that don't bother him. he's the white knight. you wanna take on the whole world by yourself? now you're gonna get your chance, sarge.
OPERATOR: sorry, sir, that number seems to be out of service. i've reported it.

COP: he was a friend of yours wasn't he? 
EDDIE: yeah.

BRENNAN: ten-four, dispatch. unit 1463 responding. 
BRENNAN: i could use a cup of coffee.

EDDIE: i want your opinion i'll beat it out of you.

EDDIE: where is luis? 
DEGAS: get the out of here.
EDDIE: talk to me, degas, or i'll hit you with so many lefts you're gonna beg for a right.
DEGAS: he's coming here. he's on his way.
