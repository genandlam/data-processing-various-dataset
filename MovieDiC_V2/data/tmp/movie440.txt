LADY PIGNOSE: son of a 
UTAH: halt. fbi!
PIG NOSE #1: i wanna say just two words to you, asshole, simu-lation!!! johnny- utah. guys like you will do anything to win! utah stares back in defiance. the surveillance van pulls up nearby.
BINOCULARS: this far, utah! you're this far from being the most overqualified guy burger king ever had. get me?!
UTAH: yes sir. sir?
BINOCULARS: what?
UTAH: i did stop the perpetrators.
LIGHTS AND BUZZERS.: pig nose explodes. more agents restrain him.

DRIVER: anywhere? you don't care? 
UTAH: anywhere. i've just never seen the ocean before.

HARP: you know less than nothing. if you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't. 
UTAH: yes, sir.
HARP: eating solid breakfasts, utah?
UTAH: sir?
HARP: all the food groups? avoiding sugar? caffeine? i see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness. we stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
HARP: this is us. bank robbery. and you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
UTAH: 1322 last year in la county. up 26 percent from the year before.
HARP: that's right. and we nailed over a thousand of them. we did it by crunching data. good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis. nobody had to tackle a car once. you getting the signal, special agent?
UTAH: zero distortion, sir.
UTAH: i love these things.
HARP: you're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, utah? i don't know why they sent you to la. must be an shortage.
UTAH: not so far.

PAPPAS: the dolls love this baby. it brings them luck when they rub it -- right between their buttons. 
COREY: angelo, we need a bigger tape.
PAPPAS: just read the number.
COREY: still a 46. maybe we can cinch it down, wear a girdle--
PAPPAS: screw you and this holistic fitness crap! at least my arms don't flap in the wind. corey secretly squeezes his bicep as...
BIG SHOULDERS: okay, pappas, let's put on the blindfold. wanna see you retrieve at least two bricks from the bottom.
PAPPAS: i've been in the field 33 years, fired my piece 23 times in the line of duty, and i got no idea what a blind man fetching bricks has gotta do with being a special agent!
PAPPAS: added to which indignity, i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner. some quarterback punk, johnny unitas or something.
UTAH: the they pull, huh?
COREY: here he comes. hold up a fish,
COREY: hey shamu, this is your guy.
PAPPAS: pappas. angelo pappas.
UTAH: punk. quarterback punk.
PAPPAS: welcome to sea world, kid.

SERIES OF TIGHT SHOTS: ecu sweep hand of a dive watch clicks through the seconds. magnum shells are fed into a pump shotgun. 
VOICE: the little hand says...
REAGAN: ... let's rock and roll.

REAGAN: use a gun, go to heaven. 
REAGAN: everybody freeze!! that's right. all tellers step back from the counter! hands on heads! move!!
REAGAN: everybody else on the floor! do it!
NIXON: linoleum, bitch!! you got earwax?!
REAGAN: just stay cool. everybody stay cool. heads down. eyes down. the money's insured-- tight on -- money flying into the sack.
REAGAN: -- it's not worth dying for. another 45 seconds of your time. that's all. then -- whoa, tricky

UTAH: good move. 
PAPPAS: yeah, they control the room well. stick strictly to the cash drawers.
UTAH: they don't go for the vault?
PAPPAS: never go for the vault. they never get greedy.
UTAH: smart. you burn time in the vault.
PAPPAS: reagan usually drives. stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance. when they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish. and i mean vanish.
UTAH: surgical. look at them separate the dye packs. and ronny know their jobs.
PAPPAS: the ex-presidents are the best i've seen, kid.
MUNOZ: anytime you two are finished jerking off watching mtv i need to get a look at that tape.
COLE: hey, pappas, you tell the kid your theory on the presidents?
PAPPAS: just take the tape, cole.
MUNOZ: hang ten, pappas, like totally rad... i gotta tell ya, the department loves it.
UTAH: what's he talking about, angelo? harp raps glass. cole and munoz look sharp.
HARP: they found the drop car up on mulholland. i want you two to go work it.
PAPPAS: what? now i'm working the drop car?
HARP: cole and munoz. i'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
PAPPAS: cole and munoz? i been on this case for two years.
HARP: that's the point, isn't it?
PAPPAS: yeah, i get it. time to play let's the old guys, huh, harp?
HARP: supervising special agent, harp. now i want you to go work the drop car, okay, angelo? okay?
PAPPAS: sure. no problem. how about your office? your office need vacuuming? we could do that too.
PAPPAS: excuse me.

PAPPAS: cute huh? they love to with us. 
PAPPAS: don't tell me, let me guess. the switch-car was stolen this morning... they vacuumed and 409'd the interior, did the windows, emptied the ashtrays...
HALSEY: yeah, the usual drill.
UTAH: could've taken their gloves off before setting that card. laser it for prints. maybe held it to his teeth -- check the edges for saliva. today was a scorcher. this chevy doesn't have air conditioning...
HALSEY: sweat secretions in the seatbacks?
PAPPAS: you through, mr. wizard? let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you're at it. hell, it's only 7:30. the night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
UTAH: well, what're your ideas on these guys?
PAPPAS: forget about it, kid. they're ghosts. let the yuppie mormon affirmative action handle it. see i'm almost 55... so i must be senile, right? they better get me out before i start myself in public. drooling. it would look bad for the bureau, right?
UTAH: so you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
PAPPAS: you watch your mouth! mr. hoover himself pinned the seal of honor right here!
UTAH: sorry.
PAPPAS: yeah. that was thirty years ago anyway. l.a.'s changed a lot since then. the air got dirty and the got clean. so you want to nail the ex- presidents? be a big hero?
UTAH: yeah. what's your theory?
PAPPAS: the punks are surfers.

PAPPAS: i'm tellin' ya, kid, it's in our face. lookit the tan on this guy. the young agent looks forward. 
UTAH: oh well he must be a surfer.
PAPPAS: shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over. there was a soil sample. non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax. so i became a wax expert. there's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
UTAH: candle wax. car wax. mustache wax? could be anything. guy's waxing his mustache at the beach. gets sand in it. wipes it off with a shoe. shoe scuffs the counter.
PAPPAS: the lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
UTAH: wax? you're not into are you angelo?
PAPPAS: surfers use it on their boards.
UTAH: thanks for the tip. i needed this knowledge.
PAPPAS: now lookit the dates on the robberies. this is strictly a summer job for these guys.
UTAH: ... four months. june to october.
PAPPAS: another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
UTAH: they're traveling the rest of the year on the money, going where the waves are...
UTAH: i think he needs a vacation.

15: highest performance, very kind. if you want to get aggro, man, this stick can handle your best rage. 
UTAH: i don't.
15: whoa!! back up! this's a 5'6" tri- fin squash-tail thruster. you'd eat major on this, dude.
15: here, you need a rhino chaser like this one to learn on. good board. i mean for a pig board.
PAPPAS: "best for your stick", huh? this might not be enough. i better get two.
15: hey, man, guys your age learning to surf, it's cool, there's nothing wrong with it.
UTAH: i'm twenty-five.
15: see that's what i'm saying, it's never too late.
15: hope you stay with it. surfin's the source. it'll change your life.

PAPPAS: johnny, it's the only way. 
UTAH: why can't i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned? ask a few questions.
PAPPAS: look. look at them out there.
PAPPAS: they're like some kind of tribe. got their own language. you can't just walk up to these guys. you've got to get out there. learn some moves. get into their head. pick up the speech.
UTAH: angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
PAPPAS: it's all balance, right? and coordination. how hard can it be?

PAPPAS: i think you gotta hit them straight on! 
UTAH: got it...
LOCAL: outta the way, you
LOCAL 2: move it, kook!
SHOOTS OUT.: it smashes sideways into razorhead. the guy does an ugly endo.
RAZORHEAD: you dinged my board, kook!!
RAZORHEAD: politeness counts, asshole!
UTAH: son-of-a--
PAPPAS: kid, maybe this ain't your sport.

UTAH: it. 
OCEAN BREAK: a horizon of whitecaps churn behind him.

WOMAN: look crazy son of a you wanna commit suicide, you do it someplace else! 
WOMAN: look at this pig-board piece-a-shit. it's still got the price tag on it, for chrissakes. what'd you do, buy it yesterday? you've got no business out here whatsoever.
UTAH: well, i saw you and--
WOMAN: yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem. right?! well you figured wrong, dork!
UTAH: hey! uh, how do i get back in?
WOMAN: carefully, tough guy. very carefully.
UTAH: my name's johnny utah!
WOMAN: who cares!
UTAH: i'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and i let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when i could have easily helped him. johnny calmly starts paddling toward shore.
UTAH: bye.
WOMAN: wait! christ!
WOMAN: go when i say. but stay down. just lie on the board. alright, let's go!

PAPPAS: this is your surfer contact? female. blond hair. green eyes. 
MISS DEER: hmm, not bad, utah.
UTAH: tyler ann endicott. born 11-27-64.
UTAH: ... exhibition of speed. indecent exposure inside moving vehicle...
MISS DEER: hot, very hot.
UTAH: felony arrest! "see adjoining file"... kidnapping?!
PAPPAS: this is great. she ties some guy up. nude. leaves the scene and fails to return for 24 hours. no convection.
MISS DEER: gotta avoid the rope tricks, johnny.
UTAH: what else they got on her? i still haven't found anything i can really use. i gotta find an approach, a way in -- here we go... both parents deceased. plane crash. san diego, '84. mmmm. yeah, definitely.

TYLER: next! oh, no. 
TYLER: what do you want?
UTAH: shrimp and fries.
TYLER: i mean, what do you want? what are you doing hanging around here.
UTAH: i need you to teach me.
TYLER: gimme a break. one shrimp and fries to go! anything to drink?
UTAH: i'm serious.
TYLER: i can see that. but forget it. stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at. miniature golf. here, your number's 37.
UTAH: well, i'm just gonna go back out there till i catch on to it or break my neck.
TYLER: what is it? you all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing?
UTAH: no, no. see, all my life i've done things for other people. in high school i played football because my old man expected me to. then my parents always figured i'd go to law school, so i did. football scholarship. graduated phi beta kappa--
TYLER: this gonna take long?
UTAH: wait, so i'm a big hero to my folks, right? but two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and i just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals. and i hadn't been living my own life. so i wanted something for myself. something that maybe didn't make any sense. you know what i mean?
UTAH: i came out here from ohio a month ago. never saw the ocean before. i didn't think it would effect me so much. like i'm drawn to it, or something. i want to do what you do. it's the truth.
TYLER: tomorrow, 6 am. here. if you're a minute late i'm gone. and stud... i didn't take you to raise. i can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. that'll be four fifty.
UTAH: keep the change, teach.

TYLER: stop here. do you agree to do exactly what i say when i say it? 
UTAH: sure.

CLOUDY PLATINUM DAWN...: tyler shouting at utah as he fights for balance. he flies off again. 
TYLER: i'm not with him.
TYLER: it's closing out completely. let's call it.
UTAH: who's that?
TYLER: that's bodhi. they call his the bodhisattva.
TYLER: the modern savage. guy's even crazier than you, johnny utah. c'mon.
ROACH: brah!
BODHI: hey tyler!

ROACH: the you doin' man?! you crazy? 
BODHI: chill, brah. you know who this is? johnny utah. ohio state, all- conference. rose bowl three years ago. right?
ROACH: johnny utah! fuckin'-a! yeah, i remember that game, man. you were on-fire. they could not stop your ass.
GROMMET: radical! head-butt, dude!! johnny gestures "please no".
GROMMET: head-butt!!!
BODHI: something happened. you got nuked in the last quarter.
UTAH: yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
BODHI: and that's why you never went pro?
UTAH: two years of surgery. i missed my window. limped through law school instead.
BODHI: mmm. a lawyer, huh? too bad. but at least you're surfing now. so your life's not over yet, right?
UTAH: not yet.

SEVERAL AGENTS: gnarly, man... hang ten... cowabunga... surf patrol... rip it up! 
HARP: how was the beach?
UTAH: fine.
HARP: surf conditions okay?
UTAH: a little mushy.
HARP: a little mushy! you think the taxpayers would like it, utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
UTAH: babes.
HARP: what?
UTAH: the correct term is babes, sir. uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech. otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. of the social infrastructure, i mean.
HARP: where is pappas?
HARP: special agent utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. yes, the surfboard bothers me. yes, your approach to this case bothers me. and yes, you bother me. you two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the ex- presidents have robbed two more banks!! do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
UTAH: caught my first tube this morning.
PAPPAS: what, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
UTAH: it sticks out, so i can't lock it. look, angelo, you think i joined the fbi to learn to surf? this was your lame-o idea in the first place. you gotta back me up on this.
PAPPAS: johnny, all i can say is we better come up with something real soon.

MISS DEER: encino savings and loan guard grabbed lbj's ponytail. we recovered one hair. 
PAPPAS: yeah, yeah, i remember, last year.
MISS DEER: one four centimeter strand. color brown. oily. slight wave.
PAPPAS: hell, what're we waiting for, let's go pick the guy up.
UTAH: angelo, pay attention. there's gonna be a test afterward. lab is showing traces of toxins. pcbs. heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
PAPPAS: guy's the toxic avenger.
UTAH: the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right? and surfers are territorial. they stick mostly to certain breaks. if we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the ex-presidents surf.
PAPPAS: no. but let's do it, anyway. it's gonna bug the out of harp.

PAPPAS: when you two are done makin' out, i need to talk to you. 
"PSYCHO-STICK" T-SHIRT: hey, i ain't no butt-bouncer, dude. we're from the valley. mall babes 'n
PAPPAS: i just want to know if you surf here a lot.
"PASSION FOR SLASHIN'" T-SHIRT: yeah, like totally everyday when it's jammin'. what is this, narco entrapment or what, dude?
PAPPAS: not exactly, dudes.

UTAH: whoa, brah, easy now... don't move! got some huge sucker crawling into your-- got it! uuuughhh. 
SURF-RAT: leave some hair, man!
SURF-RAT: what was it?
UTAH: saved your butt, bro. close one.

HALSEY: naw, this isn't it. 
PAPPAS: he moved.
HALSEY: pcbs, selenium, titanium, arsenic. the percentages look right. here's a match.
UTAH: latigo beach.
PAPPAS: surf's up, ace.

UTAH: big zippo so far. how about you? 
PAPPAS: patience hotshot. patience. it'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
WARCHILD: this the guy?
BUNKER: yeah.
UTAH: okay, so this is where you tell me all about how locals rule and yuppie insects like me shouldn't be surfing your break and all that, right?
BUNKER: no.
TONE: waste of time.
WARCHILD: we're just going to you up.
UTAH: oh.
PAPPAS: johnny? you there?
ARCHBOLD: the dude can fight!
BODHI: back off! now!! just let it go!
BUNKER: stay outta this, bodhi!
BODHI: he's with me. now back off. seriously.just do it! you alright warchild?
WARCHILD: you. everybody has backed off a bit, panting.
UTAH: what's your name?
BUNKER: bunker.
UTAH: well, listen, bunker... i'm actually kinda glad you found me.
BUNKER: yeah? why?
BODHI: whoa! whoa! hold it, ladies. give it a rest. let's go. he literally turns utah around.
PAPPAS: uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10, 12, running with a car stereo? stole the cd too, you believe it?
UTAH: no, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
PAPPAS: thanks, buddy.

UTAH: friends of yours, huh? 
BODHI: the one you decked is bunker wiess. the big one is his brother, warchild. the other two always hang. they think they're some kinda death squad around here.
UTAH: what's their program?
BODHI: they're punks. nazis. their brains are wired wrong. they hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. they just want to get radical. it's mindless aggression. they'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
UTAH: you always talk like this? you're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
BODHI: no. so i was up the beach. i saw it going down. you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch.
UTAH: thanks for stepping in.
BODHI: de nada.
UTAH: gonna be some people at my house tonight. maybe you can make it.
UTAH: where?
BODHI: come with tyler. she knows.

PAPPAS: ten seconds you're out of sight. unbelievable. 
UTAH: you're losin' them. that's right. two-denver-four-sam- niner-five-niner. late seventies jeep.
PAPPAS: look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can well stay in sight. okay?
UTAH: okay, dad.
UTAH: the jeep is registered to a bradley wiess. my buddy. guy's got quite a sheet. yeah, yeah... skip all that. gimme the greatest hits. misdemeanor possession of cocaine. that's good...

UTAH: ... felony b and e, three months in juvey. better. felony assault. postgraduate work at chino. excellent. i'm lovin' it. what about the brother? great! another model citizen. 
PAPPAS: remember, all bank robbers are
UTAH: these are the guys. i can feel it.

MUNOZ: this is this is a lead. this is totally harp must be desperate if he's listening to you two flakes. 
UTAH: see you bright and early, guys.
PAPPAS: cold pizza? it's great for breakfast.

UTAH: when did harp say they'd have the warrant? 
PAPPAS: he's pushing it through first thing. you better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.

UTAH: nice place. 
TYLER: he rents it for the summer. bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around. most a these guys can't keep a job. when the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.

GROMMET: do your worst, man! 
UTAH: don't you gamble?
BODHI: only make bets i can't afford to lose. only way to be 100% committed.
UTAH: who's the girl?
TYLER: catch of the day.
UTAH: oh, oh. that sounds personal.
TYLER: people are expendable to bodhi.
UTAH: meaning you were expendable.
TYLER: we went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them. but you can't hold it against him, he's...
UTAH: sure, he's "the bodhisattva".
TYLER: yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something. maybe he has. you've seen him surf... that frenzy. it seems like anger. it's not. it's the energy of lovemaking. the sea is the woman in his life. she's his only true lover. utah studies her a moment. he's caught the faintest hint of regret in her voice. but also the straight-ahead pragmatism. he looks down at the waves pounding mercilessly against the rocks.
UTAH: all she does is beat the out of me.

PARTY - LATER: lingering surf-rats stoned and drunk. 
NATHANIEL: ... okay, so you're in the face, it's twenty-five feet straight down, your are about this big. and the whole thing's moving, right, roaring like you're stuck to the front of a freight train. there ain't nothin' like it, man. the ultimate rush. forget about sex, it doesn't even come close.
ROACH: you lose it right then, you're history. the fish'll be pickin' you outta the coral.
NATHANIEL: thanks, brah.
ROACH: see, it's all dynamic, it's all in motion. you can't just stop and walk on in to the beach if you don't like the way things are going, y' know what i mean? you gotta ride it out man, all the way.
GROMMET: you ride the monsters, you gotta know you're ridin' a line between life and death. there ain't no forgiveness.
UTAH: so what's the biggest? waimea?
BODHI: no, bells beach, australia.
GROMMET: yeah! i remember that day... gnarly ass! was your birthday--
ROACH: the set was northwest. jacking up like a mountain of gray glass--
BODHI: i made that one mistake you pray you'll never make--
NATHANIEL: you shoulda seen it... it was like he fell for-ever. then the curl crashes down and he's gooone--
GROMMET: -- held down in the washing machine, man... it was severe, we couldn't see nothin' thought it was all over for sure-- nathaniel howls.
BODHI: not tragic to die doing what you love. you want the ultimate thrill, you gotta be willing to pay the ultimate price.
NATHANIEL: a.
GROMMET: hell, i ain't gonna see 30.
UTAH: uh. i need another beer.

TYLER: bunch of adrenaline junkies. i hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of bodhi's moonies. 
UTAH: what are you talking about?
TYLER: i've seen that kamikaze look, johnny. you've got it. and bodhi can smell it a mile away. he'll take you to the edge... and past it. hey, bodhi.
BODHI: johnny has his own demons, don't you, johnny? bodhi seems to stare into him.
BODHI: feel it?
BODHI: gentlemen, it's time.
UTAH: what's goin' on?
TYLER: swell's here, johnny. bodhi always knows.
BODHI: let's go, utah. time for a little stealth mission.

ROACH: gaping barrels! way overhead, man! closer, as moonlit figures run into the water. utah stands on the beach, hoping his eyes will adjust. 
UTAH: i can barely do this in broad daylight.
TYLER: come on. at least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
UTAH: i gotta be crazy.
BODHI: yeah, but are you crazy enough?
BODHI: football's a man-made game. you keep score with numbers. but in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent. just you and the wave.
UTAH: i know that part. tell me something i can use, here.
BODHI: i've watched you once or twice. you surf like it's some kind of street fight. you jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you. always trying to win.
UTAH: a flaw i'm working on.
BODHI: the only way to win out here is to surrender. you have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync. just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
UTAH: yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
BODHI: this one's got your name on it, johnny.
BODHI: let's go.
UTAH: i'm gonna die. i'm gonna die now.

TYLER: you had enough? 
UTAH: yeah. i just want to sit out here for a minute.
TYLER: look at you.
UTAH: what?
TYLER: well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... i don't know, like something's driving you. see, it's gone. if i didn't know better i'd say you looked almost happy.
UTAH: i... i don't know. i can't describe what i'm feeling.
UTAH: goosebumps. come here.
TYLER: those are cold.
UTAH: warm them up.

UTAH: you guys need any help? 
COLE: you're late.
PAPPAS: did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
UTAH: right here, partner.

PAPPAS: good of you to join us, hotshot. watch it. i told you, not on the hairs, goddammit. 
UTAH: i'm ready to rock, angelo. where you want me?
PAPPAS: cole and munoz are going in the back door. babbit is backing me. so i want you at the side window by the hedge. you're strictly backup, got it?
UTAH: got it.
PAPPAS: awright. get into position. i'm rolling.

PAPPAS: here scooby! where are you boy? 
FIBERGLASS: yeah? what?
PAPPAS: have you seen a little dog? kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing. about this big.
FIBERGLASS: no.
UTAH: babbit. get angelo out of there. they're pulling out a arsenal! babbit, you copy? cole?

PAPPAS: ... and the guy next door said he saw it go into your backyard. my wife'll kill me if i lose the little bastard. me, i could care less. whole house smells from it's liftin' its leg all the time... bunker looks like he's on paranoia overdrive. 
BUNKER: something's goin' down, man. this ain't right.
TONE: no, man, it's nothin'. it's nothin'.
BUNKER: will you shut the up! check the windows. do it!!

PAPPAS: you sure he isn't out back? you mind if i go take a look? 
FIBERGLASS: look, i don't know anything about your dog, okay--
PAPPAS: well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
FIBERGLASS: there's nobody else here...
WARCHILD: there's two guys by the back door.
TONE: oh, we're fucked, man.
BUNKER: that fat comes through the door i'm gonna pump him up. swear to christ, man, i'm gonna blow the dude up!

PAPPAS APPEARS BEHIND THEM.: he aims the .38. fires twice. 
PAPPAS: speak into the microphone.

PAPPAS: it's always been lasers and paper targets until today, right? 
PAPPAS: no difference, utah. just a little more to clean up. it's alright. you did good today.
PAPPAS: oh

DIETZ: you know what this is?! two keys uncut crystal meth! 
UTAH: what the hell's your problem?
DIETZ: you think i like this haircut? my wife wants me to stay at ramada -- i been working on these guys for three months! finally -- finally-- -- i get in there wantin' to play wheel of fortune so i can find out their supplier!
HARP: this is agent dietz, dea. he's got a record of your suspect's movements every day for the last three months.
DIETZ: all i wanna know is how are these guys supposed to be holding up tarzana city national on august 2nd, when they are in fort-fucking- lauderdale august 2nd!!!
HARP: not an easy thing to do, is it, utah?
UTAH: aw

TYLER: he does this.

TYLER: come on, utah. everybody's out there catchin' all the good rides. 
TYLER: what's wrong johnny? you're like a different person.
UTAH: i am a different person, tyler.
TYLER: hey. you okay? you look like you saw a ghost.
PAPPAS: forget about it, kid, they're ghosts...

TYLER: johnny... what's going on? i don't get it... did i do something?
UTAH: no. i'm sorry. i have to go. i'll, uh... i'll call you later. i'm sorry. he sets off running up the beach.

PAPPAS: hey, babe. get on over here so the big dog can teach ya how to bark. 
UTAH: woof, woof.
PAPPAS: johnny! uh, you, uh... should call first, you know? hey, where the were you all day? you gotta at least call in or something. you okay?
UTAH: angelo, we gotta talk.
PAPPAS: listen, uh... if you're okay, can it wait till tomorrow morning, kid,
I...: johnny hears footsteps and turns.
MISS DEER: angie, they didn't have the kind of wine you like but i got... oh, hi johnny!

UTAH: ... so i started tailing him. 
PAPPAS: this zen master surfer.
UTAH: bodhi, yeah. i'm on him all day, right. he goes here, he goes there, he goes to tower records and buys come cds, he has lunch at patrick's road house... ... he goes into the assured trust savings and loan.
PAPPAS: did he rob it?
UTAH: cute. he was inside for about 20 minutes. the other guy, roach, waited in the truck. they were scoping it out, right?!
UTAH: yeah, or cashing a check.
UTAH: wait, wait. then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their load it in bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit. you see? summer's almost over. they're splitting. they're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. the next day at the outside latest. i got a feeling.
PAPPAS: last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man, which i always hate because it looks bad on the report.
UTAH: angelo... i'm right this time. we can still win this one.
PAPPAS: alright, look... banks are closed. nothing's gonna go down tonight, right? so we'll be on these guys like white on rice... first thing tomorrow morning. okay? tomorrow. okay?
UTAH: woof, woof.

UTAH: they're gone. son of a we missed them. 
PAPPAS: they're on their way to maui.
UTAH: no way. not yet. come on.
PAPPAS: christ, kid! the banks don't open 'till nine.

UTAH: i say we call it in. get some backup. but you gotta do it. harp won't listen to me. 
PAPPAS: sure. no problem. i'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious. he'll probably call out the national guard.
UTAH: i say we don't call it in. under no circumstance are we to call this in.
PAPPAS: look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay? we cover the bank, whatever. you and me. that way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... i don't get my any further into the wringer than they already are.

PAPPAS: time for lunch. 
UTAH: angelo, it's eleven thirty.
PAPPAS: that place up the street has meatball sandwiches. get me two.

VOICE FROM INSIDE: two meatball, one tuna on wheat, two lemonades. total's seven eighty four. 
UTAH: here, yours is the one that looks like a road kill. enjoy.
UTAH: here's your lemonade. did you see that t-bird pull up?
PAPPAS: it's them!
UTAH: fbi!! freeze!! right now! nixon spins, raising his shotgun.

UTAH: the are they?! 
PAPPAS: they took a left at the next light!
UTAH: you sure?!
UTAH: i got 'em. i see 'em. i'm on it, i'm on it. high-speed slalom through cars and trucks.
PAPPAS: you even watching the road?

LBJ: where are they, man? i don't see 'em. we lose 'em? 
PAPPAS: nice work, hotshot. christ!

WOMAN: get the out of this house! 
UTAH: not now. not now!

PAPPAS: nothing? 
UTAH: nothing.
PAPPAS: go home, kid. get the outta here. get some sleep. you look like they get anything even resembles your guy, i'm on your beeper. here. you like feta?
UTAH: feta. my favorite.
PAPPAS: johnny...
PAPPAS: all i wanna know is one thing, why didn't you just take the shot?
UTAH: i don't know.

UTAH: ouch. 
TYLER: betadyne doesn't hurt.
UTAH: you're kneeling on my hand.
TYLER: so what'd the other guy look like?
UTAH: never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
TYLER: but you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
TYLER: johnny, what is it with you? you have that look again, it's like you're about to tell me something and then you don't... or you can't. what's going on? johnny searches her eyes. she stares at him, becoming fragile suddenly.
TYLER: what? what do you want to tell me?
UTAH: i'm glad you pulled me out of the water that day...

TYLER: a lawyer!? you lied to me! 
TYLER: look, tyler, i can-- boom! tyler squeezes off another round. cascading goosefeathers falling like snow.
TYLER: christ, johnny -- you've been using me! your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this thing's half out of the pocket... oh it's all part of some case, isn't it?
UTAH: tyler, put the gun down.
TYLER: you tell me the truth johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash? did they?!
UTAH: no. they live in columbus ohio.
UTAH: i work bank robbery. guys i'm after are surfers. i needed you, at first, but not--
TYLER: you, johnny utah. you!! don't you have a soul? you to hell!
UTAH: tyler! wait!!

TYLER: hi, it's me. leave a message. 
UTAH: tyler i... look, i up, okay. i know i up. i wanted to tell you, but i couldn't -- i was afraid you'd leave... good guess, huh? why can't i ever say what i really mean? i lied to you. i'm an asshole... but i need you, tyler. i want you to know that i've never known anyone like you before in my life... and i... i hope you change your mind...

UTAH: tyler! wait, i-- whips it open. 
BODHI: howdy brah.
BODHI: c'mon, get your gear on, we're rollin'.
UTAH: what going on, bodhi?
BODHI: here. hey, what happened? ya cut yourself shaving?
UTAH: i don't think i wanna surf right now.
BODHI: naw, this is different, johnny. this is something totally different... you're gonna love this.
BODHI: c'mon, let's go, let's go. time's wastin', brah.

BODHI: life's sure got a sick sense of humor, don't you think so johnny? 
UTAH: how you figure?
BODHI: i was picking up some bucks cause we're leaving town. bizarre, huh? if i'd waited a day i'd been right in the middle of it. kinda sorry i missed it. i'd liked to've seen them.
UTAH: takes guts to rob a bank. all that adrenalin pumping, waving loaded guns, taking out the guards, getting everybody on the floor, never knowin' who's gonna burst in... ... wondering what it's like to take a bullet. must be some ride. utah's smile is a personal challenge. bodhi sits
BODHI: banks are insured, brah. long as nobody gets shot, it's really a victimless crime. just gotta scare 'em a little, would be my guess. now if i was gonna rob a bank, with all those guys wearin' body armor these days, know what i'd carry? bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat.
BODHI: .454 casull. most powerful handgun on the planet. muzzle velocity of 2000 feet per second. twice the kinetic energy of a .44 magnum.
UTAH: one shot stopping.
BODHI: 'one shot stopping'... good, very good. i like you, johnny. i like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win. i respect that. it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. here, hold it. check out the weight. he twirls the gun, grabs the barrel and extends the handle to utah.
UTAH: nice.
BODHI: it's a special day, johnny u. a very special day... utah's gaze travels beyond the windshield.

BODHI: ever done this before? 
UTAH: once.
BODHI: pure adrenalin, right?! the ultimate rush. other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
UTAH: sure, it's a blast, but listen, i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
BODHI: yeah, i noticed you limping. but don't worry about it, brah. don't worry at all. we're not gonna land on land!
UTAH: oh, well, that's fine then. i feel so much better.

BODHI: it's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer. one last speedstar. 
UTAH: so, who... uh, who packed my chute?
BODHI: i did. what's the matter? don't trust me?
UTAH: you gotta earn trust.
BODHI: then we'll earn it together. here, take mine. bodhi swaps chutes with johnny. utah looks at the new chute uncertainly. is this a game? poker moves?
ROACH: hey... you don't want bodhi's, man. his pack-jobs suck... they only open half the time. take grommet's, man.
GROMMET: whoa, unfair, dude!
UTAH: we gonna jump or jerk off?
BODHI: my man!

BODHI: utah, you copy bruddah? 
UTAH: whoooaaah! shhiiittt! whoooaaah!
BODHI: i'll take that as a yes.
ROACH: whip it out dudes! cheap with the cosmos!
BODHI: ten thousand feet. let's do it.
BODHI: come on johnny. get in here!
BODHI: relax, brah. i got you, i got you.
GROMMET: righteous-ass speedstar, dudes!
BODHI: you diggin' this?
UTAH: great! great!
BODHI: purty-thirty and we're meat waffles, folks. see ya downtown!

BODHI: you gonna pull? 
UTAH: after you, alfonse. i insist!
BODHI: don't screw around man, pull it!
UTAH: you do it... you first!
BODHI: one thousand feet. pull the cord!
UTAH: you first!
BODHI: okay!
UTAH: christ. i gotta be losin' it.

BODHI: ya see... i told you johnny u was gonna be just fine! 
BODHI: c'mere. there's something you need to see.

UTAH: what's this? 
BODHI: insurance policy. now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah. press play.
BODHI: she's a wild one, isn't she... special agent utah?
UTAH: you're a dead man--
BODHI: whoa, whoa!! think it through! i'm the only one knows where they are. just let me talk for a second.
UTAH: talk.
BODHI: she'll be fine, rosie won't do anything. at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see... ... six hours from now.
UTAH: you call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
BODHI: sorry, can't do it, brah. he's on the road. and where they're going there's no phones. damn, i hate this johnny, i really do. i hate violence. see, that's why i need rosie. i could never make this thing work, myself. no way i could hold a knife to tyler's throat, man! she was my woman, once. we shared time in this world. but rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism. once you set him in motion, he won't stop. that's his gift, a kind of... blankness. noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes. nothing i can do, unless i get there.
BODHI: so that makes us partners, doesn't it? because now we both have the same goal... to get me where i need to go. right?
UTAH: we're wasting time.
BODHI: see! that's what i like about you, man! you're just sharp as a razor blade.
BODHI: get the plane down to santa monica and top up the tanks. let's go. let's saddle up!

BODHI: it's basic dog psychology, brah. if you scare them, get them down their leg, they submit... you control them. if you project weakness, you draw aggression... that's how people get hurt. 
BODHI: fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true. you project strength to avoid conflict.
ROACH: peace through superior firepower, babe.
GAUGE.: pockets the shells. tosses the weapon to utah.
BODHI: here, you need this. you can't be comin' through that door with your in your hands, right?
UTAH: i can't do this.
BODHI: sure you can! you may even like it... it's a killer rush. you'll see. hey, don't i show you things, johnny u?
UTAH: bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- i... am... an... eff...
BODHI: wild, ain't it?! see, we exist on a higher plane, you and i. we make our own rules. why be a servant of the law johnny u... when you can be it's master?
GROMMET: a!
BODHI: ninety seconds, man, door to door. a small price to pay for someone who loves you. she does you know. it's not her style to fall so hard... i don't think she did with me.
BODHI: sorry, johnny. guess you don't get to be president.
BODHI: rock and roll!

BODHI: everybody freeze!! don't move!! 
GROMMET: don't do it, man!
BODHI/REAGAN: all tellers back away from the counter! hands on your heads! right now!! that's right. you know the drill.
BODHI/REAGAN: all customers on the floor. let's go! move it! get down! on the floor! right now! let's go. roach and grommet are pushing them down.
UTAH: on the floor, asshole! what's your problem?! i blow your kneecaps out, you'll be on the floor!! the guy hits the deck like a sack of cement.
BODHI/REAGAN: kick in the ass, ain't it? gonna be kinda hard to explain though... when they play the tapes back down at the bureau. could look bad on your monthly evaluation.
UTAH: can we just get the money and get out of here?!
BODHI/REAGAN: that's the spirit!! head's down! eyes down! just a couple minutes of your life and we're gone.
BODHI/REAGAN: you! miss jennings... of new accounts. be a dear and open the inner gate for my associate. now!!
MISS JENNINGS: he -- he -- he has the keys. mr.
BODHI/REAGAN: whatta say, mr. duggan? wanna give her the keys or do i pick through the blood and chunks for them?
DUGGAN: do whatever they say, terry.
UTAH: you're blowing it, man! you're breaking your own rules... pulling too much time!
BODHI/REAGAN: jfk, how we doin'?
NATHANIEL/JFK: all clear, man!
UTAH: federal agent! undercover!

BODHI: don't anybody move! 
GROMMET: oh no, oh my oh it's all comin' out man, gotta stop it... it's all gonna come out... do something!!

MUNOZ: -- if you so desire, an attorney will be provided for you free of cost. do you understand these rights i have explained to you? utah? 
PAPPAS: he knows his rights! kid. i knew you were getting too close to these guys. gimme the key to these things, cole. christ!
HARP: don't take those off. just leave them on! your partner's an accessory to murder. you realize that?
HARP: three men dead. one of them a cop.
PAPPAS: look, harp. don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk. let me ride him in.
HARP: yeah, sure. why not? you two screw-ups deserve each other. that's why i put you together in the first place. christ pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind-- pappas steps close to the supervising agent.
PAPPAS: harp, let me tell you something. i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still haven't?
HARP: what that?
PAPPAS: respect your elders. let's go kid.

UTAH: i know where they're going. 
PAPPAS: figured you did. angelo flips johnny the key.
UTAH: only problem is... we can't arrest them or shoot them.

UTAH: i'm not armed. 
BODHI: but you're not alone.
UTAH: good guess. there's a gun on you right now.
UTAH: where's roach?
BODHI: around somewhere. listen, i'm in kind of a hurry, johnny u. what can i do for you?
UTAH: you gotta tell me where she is.
BODHI: and let my policy expire? sorry.
UTAH: look, bodhi man. people are dead.
BODHI: i say when it's over!
UTAH: the guy you killed was an off duty cop! if you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land. they have a new thing called radar. maybe you've heard of it.
UTAH: i know you man, when they fall on you, you won't back down. they'll have to burn your to the ground. and i can't stop them... i'm the last person they're ready to listen to right now. thanks to you.
UTAH: may or may not happen.
UTAH: look, you got a death wish, you want to ride to glory... fine! but don't take her with you, man. i'm begging you... tell me where she is. then i walk away. we've earned that much trust, haven't we?
BODHI: back in the hotseat, campadre.
UTAH: angelo! don't fire!
PAPPAS: kid, get outta the way!!

PILOT: i ain't flyin' you guys to san phillipe man, forget it. not now-- 
BODHI: thanks for telling the nice fbi agent where we're going.
ROACH: get in the plane.
BODHI: we're gonna ride this out, all the way, johnny. you and me. let's go.

PILOT: look, we been in mexico the last half hour... can i quit mowing the lawn here or what? i'm getting more brush in the wheels than i usually like, you know what i'm saying?! 
BODHI: yeah, get some height. take her up to eight thousand on this heading.
ROACH: we're gonna pop up on their screens.
BODHI: doesn't matter now. we're almost there, man. here, let me help you get your gear on.
ROACH: i'm cold.
BODHI: you're gonna be fine. just fine. johnny, toss me that money bag will you. easy does it.
UTAH: you're cold because all the blood is running out of your body, roach. you're going to be dead soon. i hope it was worth it.
BODHI: hey, johnny's just trying to psych you man, forget it. just keep thinking about all those senoritas nursin' you back to health. come on, amigo, let's get you set for the jump.
BODHI: rosie, rosie, this is air force one, do you copy, over?
ROSIE: copy you, air force one. we have a visual on you. lookin' fine.
UTAH: tell him to release tyler.
BODHI: why should i?
UTAH: what if your chute fails, bodhi? rescind the order. let her off the hook, she's served her purpose. do it, man, you owe me that much. let me hear it before you check out.
BODHI: rosie, listen carefully. surgery is canceled, is that clear? repeat it back to me.
ROSIE: copy you. surgery is canceled. i'm lettin' the go.
BODHI: i know it's hard for you johnny. you want me so bad it's like acid in your mouth. but not his time. let's go.
BODHI: you lose, campadre.

UTAH: pull the parachute!! 
BODHI: pretty radical, johnny. even for you. why don't you pull it?
UTAH: no games, bodhi. pull the cord!
BODHI: naw, you pull it!
BODHI: go on, johnny. pull it. but you gotta drop the gun, first! right?! you use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?

BODHI: you had me worried there, for a second, johnny u.

BARTENDER: gonna close early today, mate, 'fore the storm hits. 
UTAH: storm's already here... it's bringing me the swell. johnny stares into his drink.
TYLER: john, they're here.

LIEUTENANT: d'you see him, mr. utah? 
UTAH: no. but he's here.
LIEUTENANT: now, look, i know you used to be a federal agent up in the states and all that, but you're a citizen now, so just find him and we'll handle it from there.
UTAH: no problem. just give me a couple minutes with him first.

1ST SURFER: almighty, the sand's shakin'. the beach sounds like a mortar range. 
2ND SURFER: totally closed-out. it's death on a stick.
UTAH: i knew you wouldn't miss the fifty year storm, bodhi.
BODHI: and i always knew i could count on you, agent utah.
UTAH: i'm not fbi anymore.
BODHI: you never were...
UTAH: i asked them to give me a couple minutes... utah calmly glances over his shoulder.
BODHI: it went bad, brah. real bad. i just felt it was time... a booming roar sounds from the ocean.
BODHI: time to dance with the universe. i could never handle a jail cell. you'll do this for me, won't you johnny? haven't i earned this much?
BODHI: thanks, brah.
UTAH: he rode it all the way.
