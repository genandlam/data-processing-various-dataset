FINNEGAN: how we doing out there? 
FINNEGAN: yes, i'm very warm and dry in here, thank you for your concern.
FINNEGAN: a raise? i already pay you two bucks a day.
FINNEGAN: missed one darling.
FINNEGAN: i love you too.

PANTUCCI: " -- if not for the courage of the fearless crew -- " he tugs at the wires. 
PANTUCCI: " -- the minnow would be lost, the minowwww would be lost."
PANTUCCI: can we use our indoor voice please...
FINNEGAN: i'm flying blind here it!
PANTUCCI: you trying to make me feel guilty?

PANTUCCI: i know...i know...if the cash is there we don't care... finnegan this is as mean a pile of as we ever carried... pantucci notices hanover impatiently looking at his watch again, and nods for a mass of aussie mean and muscle named mason to follow him up a ladder. 
PANTUCCI: ...and some of it's coming your way.

HANOVER: you remember the first time we met finnegan? i think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off sumatra for those two chinese...what did we use to call them? 
FINNEGAN: fok yu and fok yu two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
HANOVER: no, it just struck me as odd...i don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
FINNEGAN: you know what they say...the classics are eternal.
HANOVER: so where are we?
FINNEGAN: right here...middle of nowhere...
HANOVER: and where is our point of arrival?
FINNEGAN: right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
HANOVER: which question is that?
FINNEGAN: the one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
HANOVER: take note mr. mason...this is why you hire a professional...no whining. no excuses.
MASON: i've heard a lot of stories about you mate...
FINNEGAN: all of them flattering i'm sure.
MASON: they were...but they musta been talking about another finnegan... because the one i heard about was as rough as they came...the one i'm looking at is, well, about as current as the music.
HANOVER: don't mind him finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
FINNEGAN: i don't mind him...but i do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
MASON: and who's gonna make me?
FINNEGAN: the finnegan you heard about.
HANOVER: that's why we're sill around finnegan...you and me... nothing gets the feathers up. business is business. eh?
FINNEGAN: and the classics are eternal.

OLD WOMAN: he said an orchid and a beautiful woman belonged together... it was our first date. 
OLD WOMAN: he said that it was the orchid i wore that made him fall in love with me...
TRILLIAN: he sounds like a real gentleman.
OLD WOMAN: the best of the best he was... this cruise was supposed to be our 60th anniversary gift to each other. he died last spring...
TRILLIAN: i'm so sorry...
OLD WOMAN: i was going to wear one...special for him...like a memory...
OLD WOMAN: but without him here i don't know why i should.
TRILLIAN: because an orchid and a beautiful woman belong together.
CANTON: ladies and gentlemen...
CANTON: all my life i had the dream of building the greatest pleasure ship ever to sail the seven seas... tonight, seeing all of you here...so elegant...so beautiful...so rich...

CANTON: to the fuji maru! good times forever!
CROWD: forever!! here! here!
CAPTAIN: is what true madame?
TRILLIAN: madamoiselle...that the bigger the boat...the bigger the man...

TRILLIAN: in school, the sisters said testing was my specialty.
PASSENGER: captain...
PASSENGER: my wife...
CAPTAIN: enchante...

CANTON: you wanted to see me captain? 
CAPTAIN: we have a storm rising behind us... we may have to close the canopy, i hope it doesn't ruin your party.
CANTON: ruin my party? captain, this ship was built to withstand a typhoon. i can't imagine there's anything on the sea today that could possibly ruin my party.

LEILA: gum kwa she bam dok. 
FINNEGAN: it's not noise...it's genius...

MULLIGAN: you know what my goal is? before i die i want to make love to a woman from every country on earth. 
VIVO: you mean countries that are acknowledged by the un...or like made up countries too?
MULLIGAN: what the does that mean?
VIVO: like mamooli's country...
MAMOOLI: what you talkin'? samoa's a county!
VIVO: it's a dot on a map...
MULLIGAN: map...no map...i don't give a ...they got women on samoa, it's on the list.

HANOVER: anyone else?
MASON: i'll take a go and the i vote we throw the little weasel overboard...
MULLIGAN: i vote we slit his throat then throw him overboard...
FINNEGAN: ...this is not a democracy. you don't get a vote.
FINNEGAN: i'll say it again for the hearing impaired...
HANOVER: this isn't right finnegan. i've got a contract.
FINNEGAN: 20 hours on the clock. out and back. double for overtime.
HANOVER: and no questions asked.
FINNEGAN: who asked any?
HANOVER: he did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
FINNEGAN: i know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? i need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, i'd highly recommend overlooking the indiscretion.
PANTUCCI: thanks...
FINNEGAN: you put me in that position again i'll throw you overboard myself.

CANTON: it is an amazing stone... 
CANTON: ...what were you planning on doing with it?
TRILLIAN: retiring.
CANTON: well you can still proceed with your plans then...in prison...captain... the lady...
CAPTAIN: mademoiselle...you are not a lady.
TRILLIAN: and you...monsieur...you are not a gentleman.

PANTUCCI: here's what i think...i think these mokes below are a hit squad. 
FINNEGAN: i saw these guy perform...at altmont ...you know that? they opened for the stones...
PANTUCCI: right now...there's some bozo sitting on his yacht at those coordinates they gave us, sipping his scotch and soda...totally unawares that we are about to deliver 500 kgs of high power torpedo to light up his ass...that's what's down there in that hold and who knows what the else...

FINNEGAN: hold still now...i was like three rows back. 
FINNEGAN: ...jagger was here...i was here...
PANTUCCI: you don't give a about anything do you?
FINNEGAN: sure i do...i give a that at 0300 hour we reach our point of destination. i give a that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. i give a that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
PANTUCCI: that's it? that's all you give a about?
FINNEGAN: oh yeah...and that my stitch job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...

MATE: the entire bridge electrical system is shutting down sir! 
CAPTAIN: switch over to auxiliary power, and run a circuit check.

COM. OFFICER: we're losing radar and sonar!
FIRST MATE: communications systems are out sir!
CANTON: what the is going on?

CAPTAIN: remain calm! stop! do you hear?
CANTON: dear

HANOVER: what happened?
FINNEGAN: we ran into a speedboat...
FINNEGAN: speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
HANOVER: how soon can we get up and running?
FINNEGAN: we can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
HANOVER: i have a schedule...
PANTUCCI: i spent two years building these things...screw your schedule!
MASON: you little weasel!
HANOVER: we were talking about my schedule...
FINNEGAN: you're going to have to get a new one.
HANOVER: not an option.
FINNEGAN: then you better start swimming.
HANOVER: one more joke and your comedy career is over. now fix this.
PANTUCCI: with what? look at them...they need gears...cylinder heads...oil pans... we're in the middle of the ocean...
FINNEGAN: i think he knows that joey.

MASON: tow line secure.
HANOVER: secure the zone of operation!!
HANOVER: when i was a little bit of a pissant we lived down the road from where all the big cruise ships used to come into sydney harbor...
HANOVER: mum and me we used to sit by our front door and watch them...she used to say "one day you're going to make your fortune in life on one of them..."
FINNEGAN: great woman your mother. real foresight.
HANOVER: and she could do a of a barbie to boot! belt up. you'll find all the parts you need up there.
FINNEGAN: i assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
HANOVER: i'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
PANTUCCI: you know the crew could be armed.
HANOVER: with what? martinis and tanning oil?

HANOVER: synchronize watches... 
HANOVER: 25 minutes...by the numbers. engine room and machine shop are on the third sub deck...vivo...mulligan go with them...keep in touch...move out...

LEILA: kwan bat! kwam bat! booom!! 
BILLY: yeah...yeah...yeah...
LEILA: asshole...

PANTUCCI: you'd think they'd set a deck watch... 
MULLIGAN: i thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
VIVO: maybe plans changed...
MULLIGAN: plans don't change...
PANTUCCI: maybe it's the wrong ship.
MULLIGAN: shut up!
FINNEGAN: let's just keep going.
MULLIGAN: you ain't giving the orders here!
MULLIGAN: let's keep going!

KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.: the water swirls around her waist. 
KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.: she's almost past the gaping hole now.

FINNEGAN: the hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable... 
MULLIGAN: so?
FINNEGAN: so...if the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
MULLIGAN: why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the out of here?
PANTUCCI: why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the out of here?
MULLIGAN: 'cause grease monkey ain't in my job description head... vivo pulls his feet further up on the barrel.
VIVO: what i want to know is why the ocean is always cold...since i'm a kid i hate cold water.

FINNEGAN: who are you?
CAPTAIN: he's the owner...
FINNEGAN: why don't you want a message sent?
CANTON: i just think that...
FINNEGAN: because you know a message can't be sent...
FINNEGAN: you're the inside guy aren't you? the guy who knocked out the communications.
HANOVER: bravo.
TRILLIAN: how the do we fix it?!
CANTON: you can't... all the systems were melted at their core by nitric acid...
CAPTAIN: this was your life's work...your dreams...
CANTON: my dreams cost more than they would make...i miscalculated the market... there was no way i could recoup...
FINNEGAN: unless you collected on the insurance...
TRILLIAN: what are you people talking about?
FINNEGAN: he's with them.
FINNEGAN: they rob the joint blind and torpedo it to the bottom. he collects the insurance, and sails off into the sunset clean as a whistle.
FINNEGAN: right?
CAPTAIN: all these people dead!! because you screwed up on the math??
FINNEGAN: it's not going to help us!
CAPTAIN: we're going to die here! we're going to die!

TRILLIAN: how do you know that?
FINNEGAN: takes one to know one.

CAPTAIN: help me! 
CAPTAIN: what is it?

HANOVER: alright let's move out...you two on point...
FINNEGAN: joey... which way's aft?
PANTUCCI: that way.
HANOVER: who gives a about aft?
FINNEGAN: that's where my boat's moored.
HANOVER: you trying to take over my show finnegan, that what you trying to do?
FINNEGAN: just trying to get to my boat...
FINNEGAN: they respond to sound...
HANOVER: what?
MAMOOLI: he made sense.
HANOVER: he's a bloody...

FINNEGAN: what's on the far side? 
CANTON: i don't know.
PANTUCCI: it's your ship! what the do you mean you don't know?
FINNEGAN: joey, what difference does it make...
FINNEGAN: if you hear one shot, you know i made it...start coming...
HANOVER: how do we know you're going to signal...how do we know you're not going to just take off?
FINNEGAN: i'll wait here... you go check it out.
FINNEGAN: i didn't think so.
TRILLIAN: finnegan...
TRILLIAN: be careful.

HANOVER: you deaf? 
TRILLIAN: why don't you back off?
HANOVER: you want some too?
TRILLIAN: how brave we are.
MAMOOLI: hanover!
HANOVER: fire!!

FINNEGAN: you o.k.? 
TRILLIAN: finders keepers.
MAMOOLI: where's chin?
TRILLIAN: gone...
MAMOOLI: this is not real! this is not real!
CANTON: through there...another sixty, seventy yards...there are more elevators there.
PANTUCCI: i ain't goin' up no more elevators.
CANTON: there's stairways...
MAMOOLI: i say we stay right here!
PANTUCCI: are you crazy?
MAMOOLI: there's plenty of food here. we can hold out...someone'll rescue us...
FINNEGAN: who?
MAMOOLI: someone...maybe they sent an sos!
PANTUCCI: on what? this son of a zapped the communications.
HANOVER: mamooli stand down!
MAMOOLI: we don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw billy!
FINNEGAN: boat or no boat...i'm going...
MAMOOLI: they're wipin' us out one at a time. i say we make a stand. right here! right now! maximum firepower!
PANTUCCI: somebody shoot this jerk!
FINNEGAN: nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
MAMOOLI: i'll kill you!! i'll kill you!! i'll do it! i'll do it! i'm not playin' around here!
FINNEGAN: i once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. the little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
MAMOOLI: what the are you talking about?
FINNEGAN: us...i'm talking about us... we're the fish.
MAMOOLI: and what? these things are octopuses
FINNEGAN: i don't know what these things are ...all i know is...
MAMOOLI: what...? what??

PANTUCCI: what the is going on!! 
FINNEGAN: they're herding us.
HANOVER: what are you talking about?
FINNEGAN: like cattle...
TRILLIAN: you're saying they can think?
FINNEGAN: i'm saying they're calling the shots...
CANTON: do we have to go there?

TRILLIAN: what's the matter? 
FINNEGAN: the quiet...
HANOVER: maybe we lost them.
FINNEGAN: or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
TRILLIAN: what is it?
FINNEGAN: a meat locker.
TRILLIAN: we can't just leave them here.
CANTON: i can.
PANTUCCI: oh no...oh please no.
FINNEGAN: we can't do anything for them... let's go...

TRILLIAN: you won't get her!! you won't!! 
TRILLIAN: finnegan...do something!! please!!
HANOVER: finnegan, no!!!
FINNEGAN: eat this.

FINNEGAN: looking good... 
TRILLIAN: you should talk...

TRILLIAN: so how do you get from the bronx to the south china sea? 
FINNEGAN: you quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living...
FINNEGAN: i'll break the seal! pull.
TRILLIAN: too small!

PANTUCCI: gimme one! gimme one! 
HANOVER: you

CANTON: it's going to sink.

TRILLIAN: i was so close, finnegan! so close to my island... i could almost taste the sand... 
FINNEGAN: keep tasting...

PANTUCCI: they're catchin' up! they're catchin' up! we gotta slow 'em down! 
HANOVER: feed them. that'll slow them down.
PANTUCCI: feed 'em?!! okay! all right! feed 'em what? what are we gonna feed

TRILLIAN: ah...ah...ah... 
FINNEGAN: it's ok...it's not one of them... it's from the aquarium...it's...
FINNEGAN: it's not them...it's it...
TRILLIAN: what?
FINNEGAN: you know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? a million little things like this...
FINNEGAN: ...can't exert that kind of pressure... and the way it tracked us? a million little things don't carry portable phones to coordinate positions... what's chasing us... it's one...thing...one giant...

HANOVER: help!! help!! 
PANTUCCI: ...even you don't deserve this.

TRILLIAN: wait! stop! 
CANTON: i'd like to but i have an appointment with my insurance broker!
CANTON: life takes the damndest turns, doesn't it?

TRILLIAN: you son of a bitch!! 
FINNEGAN: look!
TRILLIAN: oh my oh my how do we do it? how do we get there?
FINNEGAN: not like him.
FINNEGAN: it's the engine...it can hear the engine...it goes for the loudest sound...

FINNEGAN: hit it! hit it! 
TRILLIAN: you know, finnegan, i'm starting to believe what you said about you not being born to die on a luxury liner.

TRILLIAN: finnegan... 
FINNEGAN: yeah...
TRILLIAN: ...the minute you start your engines ...it's going to kill us, isn't it?
FINNEGAN: not unless we kill it first.
FINNEGAN: anything moves, you shoot.
FINNEGAN: there's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...i'll rev it up...that slimy will come for it like candy...
TRILLIAN: if you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
FINNEGAN: jet ski...there's one left up there.
FINNEGAN: ...let's see, it was red wire cross compressor blue wire...or blue cross red?
PANTUCCI: don't shoot!! don't shoot!!
FINNEGAN: just the man i wanted to see. on this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
PANTUCCI: not even a joey, i'm glad to see you? joey, what happened to your leg?
FINNEGAN: joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant mutated squid?
PANTUCCI: red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? a squid?
FINNEGAN: squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the do i know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...i'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of hercules...fast?
PANTUCCI: for juice, i gotta rebuild. that's not fast.
TRILLIAN: how about noise? can you get noise? we don't need speed, just noise, right?
FINNEGAN: right...
PANTUCCI: can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
FINNEGAN: seafood salad. you ever operate a jet ski?
TRILLIAN: you want me to go up there?
FINNEGAN: not unless you can wire a missile or fix an engine.
TRILLIAN: and what if i run into one of those things?
FINNEGAN: don't forget the safety.
TRILLIAN: don't take too long...i'm not planning on being on the menu tonight.
PANTUCCI: i've never seen you so congenial with a member of the opposite sex... the two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
FINNEGAN: and you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.

PANTUCCI: you know what i think? i think our luck has just about run out... 
FINNEGAN: a little to the left...
PANTUCCI: i think we gotta stop floating from one up situation to the next...
FINNEGAN: line it up now, nice and easy...
PANTUCCI: i'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
FINNEGAN: i have been.
PANTUCCI: and what have you come up with?
FINNEGAN: how does an island sound to you?

PANTUCCI: i gerry-rigged the ignition...all you gotta do is start her up...it won't go fast but it'll go loud... 
PANTUCCI: man, don't go up there...
FINNEGAN: one whistle... start the engine...
PANTUCCI: she's gone...
FINNEGAN: second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
PANTUCCI: all you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? some chick?
