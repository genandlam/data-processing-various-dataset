CHARLIE: what do you mean, he's missing?
ED: i keep trying him -- nothing. no texts, no phone. and he's not the only one who's gone. you heard roll call.
CHARLIE: so kids aren't coming to school.

ED: meet me at his house after school. we'll check around. see what's up, if he's okay. 
CHARLIE: i can't after school. i'm busy.

ED: it's so horrible! crossing the streams! will high school as we know it cease to exist?!
ED: you want me to tell your pals how well we know each other? the lego contests, the farscape conventions,

ED: then be my backup.
CHARLIE: fine. adam's after school.

AMY: i ran six miles. what did you do?
CHARLIE: i -- watched you. but not in a creepy way.
AMY: so don't judge. you don't want me to burn my big ole' booty off, do you?
AMY: what was that for?
CHARLIE: i don't know you're just...
AMY: what?

CHARLIE: nothing. 
AMY: wow.
CHARLIE: look at mom. she'sã¢â€â”
AMY: right. if he followed her home, you have to let her keep him.

JERRY: foundation problems. i had to rip up half the basement. 
JANE: these houses were built practically overnight. i'm never surprised when they come apart.
JERRY: done. just needed a new stem.
JANE: jerry, this is my son charlie. and his -- do we say girlfriend now?
CHARLIE: i guess. i mean -- only if she's--
AMY: hi. i'm amy.
CHARLIE: hey.
JANE: jerry's our new neighbor. the perry place. he's "handy."
AMY: no kidding.
JERRY: sorry about the mess, man. i was just telling your mom i'll have the dumpster gone next week.

CHARLIE: doesn't bother me. 
JANE: jerry does night construction on the strip.
JERRY: you play ball? i'm always looking for a pick up game.
CHARLIE: now and then, you know.
JANE: it's more of a collector thing. the shoes. he's obsessed. they sleep on sidewalks to get them.
JERRY: well -- they're bold. i like them.
JERRY: so... i'd ask you guys inside, but it's a mess. i've been meaning to.
JANE: be neighborly.
JERRY: a drink, something.
JERRY: soon, okay?
JANE: you bet. and thank you so much.
JERRY: least i could do.

AMY: why did you blow him off? oh my 
JANE: a guy that good-looking, still single? bad bet. he's a player.
CHARLIE: mom. breaking it down.
JANE: i've had enough man trouble. i'm not getting suckered again.
JANE: don't listen to me. jaded old

ED: hello? ed and charlie here! 
ED: come on.
CHARLIE: okay. fine.
ED: take this.
CHARLIE: you've got to be kidding me.
ED: i hate to tell you this but that guy, your neighbor.
ED: he's a vampire. one of the undead.
CHARLIE: my neighbor. next door.
ED: yeah.
CHARLIE: i just met him. jerry.
ED: jerry.
CHARLIE: that's a terrible vampire name.
ED: i didn't name him, man, i'm just reporting the facts!

CHARLIE: come on, this is a gag -- right? 
ED: hey! anybody here?
ED: get back, demon!
ED: ha! i killed that sucker dead!
CHARLIE: they're not here, okay? they left town. his dad was a deadbeat--
ED: no, see, it's not just them. it started -- there was this thing on channel 13, a lady escaped an attacker who tried to bite her.
ED: adam and me, we graphed the attack, the disappearances. whole families, gone.

CHARLIE: there's a ton of houses like that. 
ED: but every window? no. i've been watching him. it all fits--
CHARLIE: that jerry's a dracula.
ED: no. dracula is a specific vampire.

CHARLIE: i know what you're saying! i'm mocking you. you've been reading too much twilight-- 
ED: fiction, okay? this is real. a real monster. and he's not brooding. or lovesick. or noble. he's the shark from jaws. he feeds, he kills, and he doesn't move on until everyone around him is dead.
ED: and that book

ED: what about your neighbors, the perrys? he moved into their house. 
CHARLIE: yeah, in san diego like a month ago!
ED: exception, proves the rule. you haven't asked him in, have you? he can't get in without an invitation.

CHARLIE: no, but-- 
ED: your mom? lonely divorcee...
CHARLIE: you're on drugs.
ED: no! well, yeah... i thought you'd take my word, but i have evidence at home. hard evidence.
CHARLIE: yeah. okay.
ED: we have to stake him in his nest.
CHARLIE: right. cause he's nocturnal.
ED: just for -- okay -- for a minute pretend you're not a douche now--
CHARLIE: look, ed, this stuff, it was fun when we were eight--

CHARLIE: whatever! i grew up, okay? you don't want to, fine. but don't get an attitude because i'd rather have a life than make up! 
ED: right. got it. you're soooo cool "brewster." go ahead, join the clark high early-peakers. this is the pinnacle for them. and that includes your girl--

CHARLIE: shut up. 
ED: undeniably doable, but we used to make fun of her and her pals, remember? they're bimbos--
CHARLIE: shut up!
ED: adam's gone -- you act like it has nothing to do with you.
ED: we were inseparable, man.
CHARLIE: yeah. and you know when i got popular? the minute i stopped hanging out with you.

ED: sorry. sorry-- 
MARK: my mom works hard on that

ED: can you just hit me? i don't have time for the build up. go. 
MARK: seriously?
ED: man! just do it!
ED: crap. crap!

ED: forget it sucker! no invite! 
JERRY: abandoned. i thought you did your homework.
ED: -- what?
JERRY: you've been watching me. i've been watching you. seems fair.

JERRY: bit off more than you can chew. shaking, terrified, ed brandishes the stake. 
ED: we'll see, man. i know my
JERRY: really? who's going to believe you? you see the truth, but what good is it when you're alone?
ED: don't play that stuff. that mind crap. come on -- try me. try me!

JERRY: you say you're glad you're different. but how can you be in a place like this? these people... even your best friend. you're nothing to him now. 
ED: get back!
JERRY: it can be over. i can make all that pain go away.
ED: no...
JERRY: you were born for this and you know it. your "life", what you had? that's the illusion. i can take you somewhere great. somewhere you'll belong.
JERRY: it's a gift.

JANE: good on his word. 
AMY: morning. charlie?
JANE: you try. my voice seems to be on some frequency he can't hear.

CHARLIE: coming! 
AMY: talk to hot neighbor again? you should facebook him.

RICK: he's usually up and out early.
CHARLIE: no, sure. we're working on a class project. i guess we crossed paths.
VICTORIA: i'm so glad you're doing that. ed, he'd be mad that i said so, but he talks about you all the time.
CHARLIE: yeah. that's... he's great.
CHARLIE: would it be okay if i went upstairs? ed has a book we need.

JERRY: can i help you with that?
CHARLIE: no! no. thanks. i'll get it.

CHARLIE: yeah.
JERRY: you don't mind my saying, you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid. your pal, amy? she's ripe. must be a line of guys dying to pluck that. your mom too -- you don't see it, maybe you do -- she's giving it off. it's on you to watch out for them. you up for that?

AMY: we won't stay up all night. bee and cara need help with trig -- it's not a party. okay. okay... 
AMY: mom? i love you.

CHARLIE: like what? a vampire moved next door, borrowed some beer, ate a stripper and then blew up our house because we wouldn't invite him in? 
AMY: okay.
DOCTOR: you should get some rest.
CHARLIE: she's going to wake up, right?
DOCTOR: assuming the swelling is minimal, i hope so.
CHARLIE: but you don't know.
DOCTOR: not yet. we need to give it time.

ASSISTANT: bye babe. good show tonight. 
PETER: you were late again on "the devil's torture chamber." but she's gone.
74.: absently, he sifts through them. stops. he picks up the one of the insignia.

CHARLIE: this is my fault. 
AMY: you didn't make any of it happen.
CHARLIE: ed came to me. i turned my back on him.
AMY: how were you supposed to believe him? none of it makes sense.
CHARLIE: he did talk a lot of demented crap. he was my best friend. he asked me, begged me, to believe him.
AMY: people change. everybody--
CHARLIE: yeah they do. i turned into a i figured my dweeb past, not big with the ladies.
AMY: so you're saying this is my fault.

CHARLIE: i wanted you to like me. i tried to erase ed -- all of it. i know how that feels. 
AMY: i knew you were a dweeb. you think i want a "dude" like mark or ben? i like that you're different... it didn't hurt that your skin cleared up.
AMY: i can't believe we didn't have sex.

AMY: no, seriously. i'm going to die a virgin? me? how did this happen? 
CHARLIE: we're not going to die--
AMY: but what if we do? let's do it. now. the bathroom. charlie.
CHARLIE: i think we should kill the vampire first. i'll perform much better.
AMY: oh my charlie. what are we going to do?
CHARLIE: we're going to fight.
CHARLIE: hello?

AMY: the peter vincent? 
CHARLIE: under-whelming, believe me. but he's what we've got.
CHARLIE: my mom is very religious.

CLOSE ON: a midori cocktail 
PETER: i'll tell you what i know, but that's it. don't expect me to join your scooby gang.
CHARLIE: anything. i'll take it.
PETER: i found the origin of that insignia you showed me. it's a species that originated in the mediterranean. they nest in the earth -- explains that hole you saw. and they kill slowly, keep their victims alive for days.

PETER: "snackers." 
CHARLIE: so -- they turn all of them? make their victims into vampires.
AMY: i know. i read.
PETER: no. it takes a while before they complete the change. they usually finish them off before that.
AMY: so how do you kill these guys, this "tribe"?
PETER: usual stuff. but it's a strong breed. you need a plan--
ARTHUR: delivery. guy says you need to sign for something.
PETER: send him in.
PETER: i order things when i've had a few cocktails. it's a--
CHARLIE: wait. you get deliveries this late?
PETER: i don't know. maybe-- charlie stands.
CHARLIE: no. you said he could come in.
AMY: what? charlie--

VOICE: an invitation, airhead. 
ED: looking at them now. yes sir. he's modern, jerry, dispensed with all that "master" stuff.
ED: hey bud.
CHARLIE: you've got a problem, keep it with me.
ED: problem? you let him get me, man.

ED: you let him turn me into this. 
PETER: stay away, demon.
ED: "stay awaaaay, demon!"

ED: whatcha got there? itsy bitsy little stakey? 
PETER: crucifixion nail. lethal to you.
ED: old school. nice. got to get pretty close to use it, though.
ED: uh uh. no you don't.
CHARLIE: the elevator!

AMY: oh my oh my 
CHARLIE: look at me. stop.
CHARLIE: there's another way out of here. and there are a million things to fight with in here. understand? we're going to make it.

ED: give it up, chuck! you're dead. 
ED: if you hadn't ended up such a dick, i might have tricked you out. we could have rocked this evil but you blew it. nothing but the big dirt nap for you and your lady.

GUARD: sign in, please. 
JERRY: i know where i'm going.
GUARD: sign in. no exceptions.
GUARD: hey! i'm talking to you. sign in, or you're not going nowhere.

ED: i expected more of a fight. girl's made you lazy in the head. pussy'll do that. 
ED: look at that. vincent's got a vincent.

ARTHUR: .i have ...kids ... 
ED: had.
ED: don't take it personal. i'd eat you -- but i'm saving my appetite.
ED: dinner with an old friend.

ED: mano e...one mano. piece of cake. cause i'm a killing machine, and you're like all the clark high big shots -- nothing. 
ED: you picked the wrong side, man.
CHARLIE: i didn't pick--
ED: you didn't think.
CHARLIE: i know. i'm sorry.
ED: steeeerike! call that a swing, slugger?
ED: come on! you're not even trying.

AMY: charlie! 
JERRY: you are something, aren't you?
JERRY: werewolves. amy flings holy water in his face.
AMY: vampires.

ED: is this weird for you too? i feel like such a homo-- 
AMY: do it. charlie! charlie's frozen.
ED: wow. bimbo has some juice--
AMY: jerry's here. he's coming!
CHARLIE: i'm sorry.
ED: i wasn't even a badass vamp. i was his renfield. funny if you--

AMY: stop. stop, i need to-- 
CHARLIE: not now. he's coming for us.
AMY: he can't kill us, not here--
CHARLIE: who's going to notice? who's going to care? amy, look around--

AMY: oh, 
CHARLIE: keep moving. come on.

DJ: tequila man t-shirts! yeeeeeahhhh! the crowd goes nuts, surges forward... 
AMY: charlie!

JERRY: holding her with a firm grip. 
AMY: no. no!
AMY: help!!
GUY: go get her, man!

AMY: help me! help!! 
CHARLIE: peter! we're in the casino, the club! jerry's got amy! he's got

AMY: charlie's coming, he'll find me-- 
JERRY: i'm counting on it.
JERRY: come on.
JERRY: you just need a taste. you'll see. it can be like a dream.

JERRY: that's it... good girl. 
CHARLIE: amy! no!-- bam! a hand falls on his shoulder.

DOORMAN: how'd you get in here? 
CHARLIE: you have to help me. that guy, he's going to kill her, he's a

DOORMAN: yeah? then she's liking it. 
CHARLIE: you don't understand!--
DOORMAN: id. then you can tell me your whole sad story--
CHARLIE: no! there's no time-- amy!!
JERRY: sees that charlie is restrained.

CHARLIE: i see you got my message. 
PETER: how'd you get in here?
CHARLIE: security's a little lax. everybody got their throat ripped out. peter backs away as charlie moves in.
PETER: you too? he change you?
CHARLIE: look at your monitor.

CHARLIE: i don't know if amy's alive or dead or turned -- but he's got her. my mom may not make it. and ed... 
CHARLIE: i'm going to end him, or he's going to end me.

CHARLIE: one way or the other, that's how it's going to be and you're going with me. 
PETER: don't you get what this is? there's no fighting. there's only surviving, if you're lucky--
CHARLIE: you call this surviving? if you live and we all die, you think you'll ever be able to get us out of your head?
PETER: i know i won't. i never could -- not after the first time.
PETER: i told myself i probably made it up. i was a kid. maybe it was easier to believe in monsters...
CHARLIE: made what up?
PETER: the vampire who killed my parents, my brothers. but not me. i hid.
PETER: i didn't collect all this stuff for fun. i thought maybe i could find the tribe, "avenge" my people.
CHARLIE: so do it. we'll go in at dawn.
PETER: it's not like that. when i was a kid, i hid because i wanted to live. i still do! this isn't the comics. you want to be a dead hero. good for you. but i'm out.

PETER: you think i'm a coward. i'm just a realist. 
CHARLIE: so you bail on people, erase them.
CHARLIE: i don't want to make it to tomorrow, not if you're the kind of man i have to be.
PETER: wait.
PETER: blessed by saint michael. kill a vampire with it -- it's supposed to turn his victims back. if amy's changed, you can still save her.
CHARLIE: if it's for real.
PETER: who knows what's for real any more.
PETER: there's no guarantee he'll be asleep during the day. he's housebound, not hibernating.
CHARLIE: i'll figure it out.
PETER: no, you need a plan. to stake him, you have to get close -- he's stronger than you.
CHARLIE: holy water?

PETER: slow him down. won't stop him. 
PETER: torch him, you'll have a few good minutes before he really goes up. believe me, a vampire on fire isn't thinking clearly.
CHARLIE: but if he's on fire, how do i get close enough to stake him?
PETER: 
CHARLIE: you just worry about yourself. with that, charlie leaves.

CHARLIE: those rooms upstairs, that's probably where he's got amy. 
CHARLIE: then i have to get him on the ropes.
CHARLIE: i have to go.

CHARLIE: going to kill a vampire. 
STORE GUY: good for you.

AMY: you shouldn't be here-- 
CHARLIE: where is he?
AMY: i don't know. he dumped me here.
CHARLIE: how do you feel?
AMY: i'll survive. please get out of here. he's too strong--
CHARLIE: i'm stronger.
CHARLIE: in a nerd power way. you know...
97.: he reaches into his jacket, pulls out a cross.
CHARLIE: take this. it should-- he looks up. amy is gone. disappeared.
CHARLIE: amy? amy!?
CHARLIE: you--
PETER CHARLIE: sorry-- how'd you-- a beat. then:
PETER: guess i don't want to be a man like me either.
PETER: let's kill something.

CHARLIE: you reek. midori? 
PETER: don't get greedy. i'm here.
PETER: and i found something else. from my collection. powerful
CHARLIE: wooden bullets? nice.
PETER: no, you think i'm macgyver? bullet, bullets. they'll buy us some time.
CHARLIE: we have to find amy. she was in a room upstairs, then she just disappeared. this house--
PETER: what do you mean she "disappeared?"
CHARLIE: she was there. i looked away, looked back -- she was gone.
PETER: show me where.

PETER: floor trap. i use it all the time. 
CHARLIE: where does it go?
PETER: only one way to find out.

CHARLIE: wait -- you're going in? 
PETER: see that? like a great date. get me drunk and i'll try anything.

CHARLIE: you uncover him. i'll light him up, then stake him. 
CHARLIE: flame retardant.

CHARLIE: gas. 
PETER: you should be a magician.
PETER: stop! no--
PETER: who is that?
CHARLIE: adam. i know him. knew him.
PETER: shh. don't wake him up, for

PETER: you know them too? charlie reacts, stunned. 
CHARLIE: ms. granada. my geometry teacher.
CHARLIE: she was hard up.

PETER: how about we go back to my "run away" plan? 
CHARLIE: we can't burn jerry out. there's no way we'll get all these people out if the house goes up.
PETER: i thought you're here for amy. great. right. save the geometry--

CHARLIE: amy, 
AMY: charlie.

AMY: you should have run with me while we had the chance. you should have saved me, charlie. 
103.: charlie takes this in, pained. then--
CHARLIE: it's not too late.
AMY: it is. he's inside me now.

JERRY: it's over, guy. charlie -- his girl's having her way with him. 
JERRY: she's way out of his league anyway.
PETER: stop! stop!
JERRY: and your aim--
PETER: you don't get it! i'm on your side.

AMY: you wouldn't. 
CHARLIE: try me.
AMY: i'll be the best you ever had. the only you had.
AMY: charlie. we can be together forever.

CHARLIE: get off him! 
ADAM: dude!
CHARLIE: sorry.
JERRY: i'll finish this.
PETER: worth a shot. "master of illusion."
JERRY: you think that's going to stop me? time to man up.

JERRY: now. i'm going to kill your girl -- make you watch. i'll take my time with you. and once you're dead, i'll finish your mother. 
JERRY: too bad about that one. she sucked me dry. like a pro.

107.: charlie looks at him -- amazed. 
PETER: i'm better with stationary targets.
CHARLIE: yeah you are.
PETER: get out of here. we don't have much time before they dig out.
CHARLIE: i can save you. i have to kill him with this.
PETER: you're a brave mother, i get it. and you were right. this is how i had to go... but we didn't count on an army.
CHARLIE: he'll kill you both, he said--
PETER: we're already dead.
PETER: go now, you live to fight another day. stay -- there won't be one.
PETER: do it.
CLOSE ON CHARLIE: accepting it. it's what he has to do.
PETER: charlie!
PETER: stop!

AMY: charlie! 
AMY: charlie...
CHARLIE: blow me? seriously?
CHARLIE: those are his last words? what a tool. we pull away, leaving this tableau...
MS. GRANADA: let's agree to never talk about this.

JANE: think you'll ever feel the same about a nighttime sky? 
PETER: same as what? i was always terrified.
JANE: right. we're just catching up.

CHARLIE: i'm not seeing that. 
AMY: she deserves some fun. your mom fully cheated death.
CHARLIE: you too. you deserve fun.
AMY: oh, i plan on it. now that you've killed your first vampire...
CHARLIE: i am so going to perform.
VOICE: "frak!" "frak!"
AMY: what is that?
CHARLIE: battlestar.
AMY: right.
CHARLIE: it was ed's.
AMY: right.
AMY: frak?
PETER: frak! right on.
PETER: perfect woman, can i get you a drink?
AMY: i'll take another. thanks.
CHARLIE: i'll give you a hand.
CHARLIE: i thought you were on the wagon.
PETER: it's dark. i'm on the "day" wagon.
CHARLIE: thanks for inviting us.
PETER: we should celebrate. being alive.
CHARLIE: you wanted to put the moves on her.

PETER: what? no. what? 
CHARLIE: just -- i'm watching you. i've got to look out for her.
PETER: yeah you do. so here's what i'm thinking. we faced the beast and we won. can you imagine the possibilities if we had got that on film?

PETER: show up on film, yeah. but werewolves do, bigfoots do. we get proof, catch something -- we could build a stage act around that, you wouldn't believe. we'd blow those cirque away! 
CHARLIE: an act? seriously? what about saving people from evil? what

PETER: it happens. all this stuff... 
CHARLIE: ever think about collecting something else? snow globes or--
