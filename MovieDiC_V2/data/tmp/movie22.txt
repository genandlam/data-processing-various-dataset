ANITA: we're like nobody else i know.
ELAINE: i'm a teacher. why can't i teach my own kids? use me.
ANITA: darryl says you use knowledge to keep me down. he says i'm a "yes" person and you're trying to raise us in a "no" environment!
ELAINE: well, clearly, "no" is a word darryl doesn't hear much.
WILLIAM: mom --
ELAINE: everything i say is wrong.
ANITA: i can't live here! i hate you! even william hates you!
WILLIAM: i don't hate her.

ELAINE: i also put you in first grade when you were five and never told you.
WILLIAM: so... i'm... how old?
ANITA: you lied to him! you make such a big deal about the truth and you lied!
ELAINE: he never asked.
ANITA: what -- like he's going to ask if he's as old as he and his dad.
ANITA: you put too much pressure on him!
WILLIAM: how... old...
ANITA: and when he rebels in some strange and odd way, don't blame me.
WILLIAM: ... am i?
ELAINE: i skipped you an extra grade. you're eleven.
WILLIAM: eleven.
ELAINE: and you skipped kindergarten because i taught it to you when you were four.
WILLIAM: this explains... so much...
ANITA: you've robbed him of an adolescence!
ELAINE: adolescence is a marketing tool.
ANITA: he's got no "crowd"... no friends...
WILLIAM: okay!
ANITA: honey, i know you were expecting puberty. you're just going to have to shine it on for a while.
ELAINE: who needs a "crowd?" you're unique. you're two years ahead of everybody. take those extra years and do what you want. go to europe for a year! take a look around, see what you like! follow your dream! you'll

ANITA: one day you'll be cool.
ELAINE: she'll be back.

WILLIAM: smith-corona galaxis deluxe.
BANGS: you like the new lou reed?
WILLIAM: the early stuff. the new stuff, he's trying to be bowie, he should be himself. i'm not a big lou man.

BANGS: take drugs?
WILLIAM: no.
BANGS: smart kid. i used to do speed and sometimes nyquil and stay up all night writing and writing, like 25 pages of dribble about, you know, the guess who, or coltrane,

WILLIAM: okay. see you. 
BANGS: i can't stand here all day talking to my many fans.

BANGS: -- so anyway, you're from san diego and

ESTRELLA: who are you with? 
WILLIAM: me? i'm with myself.
ESTRELLA: no, who are you with? what band?
WILLIAM: i'm here to interview black sabbath. i'm a journalist. i'm not a... you know...
PENNY LANE: ... you're not a what?
WILLIAM: oh... i'm just... not a... you know.
PENNY LANE: not a "what"?
WILLIAM: you know. a "groupie."
ESTRELLA: ohhh!
WILLIAM: sorry, i -
PENNY LANE: we. are not. "groupies."
ESTRELLA: this is penny lane, man. show some respect.
WILLIAM: -- sorry.
PENNY LANE: "groupies" sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous. we are here because of the music. we are band aids.
ESTRELLA: she used to run a school for band aids.
PENNY LANE: we don't have
PENNY LANE: it's a long story. i'm retired now.

ESTRELLA: "... just blow-jobs, and that's it." 
WILLIAM: okay. well, see, now i get the difference.
ESTRELLA: polexia!! did you tell sabbath we were going to be here?
POLEXIA: i talked to with stillwater, i talked with sabbath. they're all dying to see us. it's all happening.
PENNY LANE: this is our journalist friend. journalist friend, meet estrella starr, and polexia aphrodisia. and you are --
WILLIAM: william.
POLEXIA: here comes sabbath!
ESTRELLA: ozzy!!! tony!!! it's us!!
POLEXIA: okay. i was with ian hunter
PENNY: yeah. i know he's such a talented guy. i mean, look at him. who deserves it more?
POLEXIA: nobody -- he's so sweet.
ESTRELLA: don't you just

SAPPHIRE: oh no. not this one -- 
SAPPHIRE: who brought
SCOTTY: he wasn't with you.
SAPPHIRE: are you going to turn this into a thing?
SCOTTY: all of you can wait outside! top of the ramp!
WILLIAM: i don't want to cause a thing. i'll wait.
DICK: let us in, we're stillwater! we're on the show!! creem magazine.
WILLIAM: hi, i'm a journalist. i write for
WILLIAM: i'd like to interview you or someone from the band.
DICK: i'm sorry but could you please
JEFF: you guys rolling stone.
RUSSELL: yeah. okay. off anyway. we play for fans, not critics.
WILLIAM: russell. jeff. ed. larry. i really love your band. i think the song "fever dog" is a big step forward for you guys. i think you guys producing it yourselves, instead of glyn johns, was the right thing to do.
JEFF: yeah, come back here!! keep going!
SCOTTY: not this one.
RUSSELL: he's with us.

RUSSELL: red dog! 
RED DOG: we're playing here tomorrow night.
JEFF: this is red dog, the allman brothers band's number one roadie.
RUSSELL: how're the guys?
RED DOG: havin a ball, man. when we have a party, we have an

RUSSELL: but we didn't do it for that! we are here because we needed to be here, not just 'cause we needed to away from troy, michigan, which we did... but what it all comes down to is that 
RUSSELL: the buzz! and the chicks, the whatever, is an off-shoot of the buzz. and like -- you saying you liked "fever dog?" that is the buzz, man. all we get are these old-ass interviewers who don't understand, don't listen, don't appreciate why we are here, which is the buzz.
JEFF: the next album will be even better.
RUSSELL: but... it's not what you put in, is it? it's what you leave out. listen to... listen to marvin gaye...
WILLIAM: i know that, "woo."
RUSSELL: that's what you remember. the silly things, the little things... there's only one, and it makes the song. it's what you leave out. that's rock and roll. william nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed.
JEFF: we used to talk more about this stuff.
RUSSELL: okay. see, this is maybe the most honest we've ever been in an interview because
RUSSELL: there you go. still young enough to be honest.
DICK: ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who isn't in the band --

PENNY LANE: i found you a pass. 
WILLIAM: thanks. i got in with stillwater. the guitarist, russel hammond, he just thoroughly opened up. he is by far the best and most honest interview i've ever done. i've only done
WILLIAM: eighteen.
PENNY LANE: me too. how old are we really?
WILLIAM: seventeen.
PENNY LANE: me too.
WILLIAM: actually i'm 16.
PENNY LANE: me too. isn't it funny? the truth just sounds different.
WILLIAM: i'm 15.
PENNY LANE: you want to know how old i really am?
WILLIAM: no.
PENNY LANE: it's a long story.
WILLIAM: right. right.
PENNY LANE: we live in the same city. we should be friends.

WILLIAM: no.

WILLIAM: cool. alright.
DARRYL: okay, man.

WILLIAM: i thought it was pretty good.

POLEXIA: act one, in which
POLEXIA: stop them? you were her excuse for coming here.

PENNY: i need ice! 
POLEXIA: i just worry about people using her. you know? 'cause she brings out the good side in everybody else, but what do they do for
POLEXIA: do you smoke?
WILLIAM: no. but i... i grow it. i grow it.
POLEXIA: you're funny. you know, if you were only taller, english, rich, a guitar- player and older...
WILLIAM: i'd be someone else.
POLEXIA: yeah. good point.

PENNY: how does it end? 
RUSSELL: what?
PENNY: you know - the story about the girl who dumps the guy who has an ex-ex wife -- the one we don't talk about -- and gets a hundred... okay, five letters from him, and then doesn't even leave a pass in san diego. wake up! i'm retired and i never believed you anyway. you're too talented and too good-looking to be trusted and everybody knows it.

WILLIAM: ... swill merchants...

ELAINE: whatever it is, the answer is no. 
MRS. DEEGAN: elaine, we need to talk to you. what are you doing here?

RUSSELL: you know. we should talk about what we don't talk about.
PENNY: we don't have to.
RUSSELL: no, i - i went to catholic school. i believe in guilt and... you know, if there's any to be had, i pretty much want to roll around in it.

QUINCE: look at the dogs, wearing the funny hats. juggling just for you. freaks and family... 
JEFF: i think he was a gift from actually. nobody plays like russell hammond.

RUSSELL: well then who's job is it? because my is dying for a kiss.
DICK: it's my job. you're all geniuses. and let me just add this thought -
QUINCE: the dong is called "love thing." your mind is starting to take effect. they're all here to see you swallow fire. you scream soundlessly... on the

ELAINE: may i speak with william please? 
ESTRELLA: he's not here. i think he's in the bar with the band. they just got back from the radio station. is this maryann with the pot? silence. estrella hello?
ELAINE: no this isn't maryann with the pot. this is elaine... his mother.
ESTRELLA: i thought you were english.
ELAINE: could you please give him a message?

RUSSELL: for a minute i thought you were actually a real journalist... which is... you know, it's great. shut that thing off, and i'll tell you the truth. william shuts his tape recorder off. 
WILLIAM: it's off.
RUSSELL: look. i trust you. i'm going to lay this right on you. just make us look cool.
WILLIAM: i will quote you warmly and accurately.
RUSSELL: that's what i'm worried about. see - some of us have girlfriends back home. some of us have wives. and... some of the people you meet on the road are really amazing people... oh. yeah.
RUSSELL: you know what i mean?
WILLIAM: right. yeah.
RUSSELL: see, you're dangerous. most people are just waiting to talk, but you listen.
WILLIAM: right. right.
RUSSELL: so your question you asked me. i think about it every night. the "business." i hate it! i grew up with these guys, okay? i can't play all that i can play, i'm past these musicians, do you understand?
WILLIAM: i do.
RUSSELL: the more popular we get, the more i can't walk on them, the bigger their houses get, the more pressure... you forget, man. you forget what it was like to be real, to be a
RUSSELL: man, it feels good to say this stuff out loud. but what am i doing? i'm telling secrets to the one guy you don't tell secrets to.
WILLIAM: no, that's okay. we'll do the interview tomorrow.
RUSSELL: this is good. so there's the "friend" and then there's the "interview guy."
WILLIAM: yeah.
RUSSELL: so tonight it's "friend".... and when we wake up tomorrow - "

WILLIAM: how would you describe your role in stillwater? what is the chemical that you add to the chemistry? 
LARRY: i'm the bass-player.
WILLIAM: right. and when you take that away... what would be missing? stylistically?
LARRY: the bass?

DICK: get in, get in!! 
PROMOTER: are you the manager of this band?
DICK: that, and more. get in!
PROMOTER: you didn't even play a full set!
DICK: your shoddy stage set-up almost killed our guitarist!
PROMOTER: you trashed the dressing room - you didn't play your thirty-five minutes.
DICK: everybody in! get in the bus!
PROMOTER: i'll report you to every promoter in the country!

PENNY: don't worry. it's happened to all the greats. thank you didn't hold the mike stand with both hands, you'd still be holding it. this is a good thing. it's a good, good, good thing. 
ESTRELLA: i forgot to tell you! your mom says to call home immediately. she says
WILLIAM: what did it feel like to be electrocuted?
RUSSELL: it burns. it feels like a dose of lead shooting through your body... and then you see and he says, "how bad do you want to be legendary?" and

PENNY: give that to me. 
WILLIAM: what will our names be?
PENNY: what do you think of russell?
WILLIAM: i like him.
PENNY: you're coming to cleveland, right?

WILLIAM: what problems? 
PENNY: okay. i got it. i think your name should be spencer, and mine will be jane.
WILLIAM: i can't keep up with you.
PENNY: no one can.
WILLIAM: what's your real name?
PENNY: here's the thing about russell. he's my last project. i only do this for a very few people.

JEFF: hey. 
WILLIAM: hey.

RUSSELL: fire away. i'm ready. i'm on the "you" train. take me there. 
WILLIAM: do you have to be depressed to write a sad song? do you have to be in love to write a love song? is a song better if it really happened to you? like, "if you say nothing"... where did you write that and how did it come about?
RUSSELL: when did you get so professional?
PENNY: i'm almost done with my shirt.
DICK: russell, your dad showed up again. and on a lighter note. gentlemen. your first t-shirts have arrived.
JEFF: yeah. okay.
RUSSELL: because i can see by your face - you want to get into this -
JEFF: how can you tell? i'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.
RUSSELL: here we go.
JEFF: well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.
RUSSELL: it's a t-shirt.
JEFF: i'm always gonna tell you the truth.
RUSSELL: are you doing coke again?
JEFF: excuse me, but didn't we all get into this to avoid responsibility?
JEFF: forgive me. but this is the slow-moving train of compromise that will
JEFF: i works as hard or really mean.
JEFF: oh, this is the part where you quit -
RUSSELL: right. i'm so predictable.
JEFF: no i gotta tell the truth -- i want you to like me. but sometimes i feel like you collect people who love you and then very skillfully... you make them feel bad that they're not good enough for you.
RUSSELL: stick to singing, brother, 'cause you ain't gonna make it as a shrink.
JEFF: deal with it! and let me just say what nobody else wants to say to you -
RUSSELL: what?
JEFF: your looks have become a problem.

DAD: son! 
RUSSELL: hello harry.
DAD: he got all the good genes, huh? meet deirdre. we're getting married in july.

WILLIAM: you okay? you alright? 
RUSSELL: from here on out, i'm only interested in what's
RUSSELL: you know, you know all about us and i don't know
RUSSELL: okay, that's good. that's enough.

DICK: definitely. it's all over. we'll just ride on to greenville, listen to some great music, finish the tour, and leave those ungrateful fools behind. and then we'll come back here, where you'll live.

WILLIAM: i'm not one of you.
PENNY: oh! if you go to cleveland, bowie's going to be there at swingo's, the greatest hotel in america. i'll introduce you to him, and his security guy dennis.
WILLIAM: don't you have any regular friends?
PENNY: famous people are just more interesting.
WILLIAM: well, i would be worried that they were using
WILLIAM: let me finish. i'm not famous.... but you could always use
WILLIAM: did he call? what are you -- stop it -- we're talking here.
SAPPHIRE: pants him. opie must die.

WILLIAM: i'm getting good stuff out here. 
BEN: sounds like it.
POLEXIA: man, i need some - he clamps a hand over her mouth.
BEN: now listen. get it together. we're both professionals, i don't have to tell you this. you're not out there to join the party -- we already have one hunter thompson. you're out there to interview and report. you got me?
BEN: i like what we're saying. let me try and get you a thousand more words. it's in consideration for the cover, but don't tell the band.
WILLIAM: crazy.

PENNY: come to cleveland.
RUSSELL: come to cleveland... come to cleveland...
WILLIAM: i can't!!
RUSSELL: can we help it if we like having you around!
PENNY: rock and roll!
WILLIAM: rock and roll.

RUSSELL: i feel... like his parents. 
PENNY: i know.
RUSSELL: i wonder how that happened.
PENNY: you ever notice that all our sentences begin with "i?"
RUSSELL: i hadn't, no.
PENNY: 'cause we should work on that.

RUSSELL: tell her you're a slave to the groove - you can't help it! 
WILLIAM: no.
RUSSELL: hi mom! it's russell hammond, i play guitar in stillwater! it's my fault. how does it feel to be the mother of the future of rock journalism? hello?
ELAINE: listen to me. your charm does not work on me. i'm onto you. of course you like him.
RUSSELL: yes.
ELAINE: he worships you people and that's fine with you, as long as he helps make you rich.
RUSSELL: rich? i don't think so -
ELAINE: listen to me. he's a smart, good- hearted, 15 year-old kid, with infinite potential.
ELAINE: if you break his spirit, harm him in any way, keep him from his chosen profession -- which is
ELAINE: i didn't ask for this role, but

RUSSELL: your mom kind of freaked me out. 
WILLIAM: she means well.

WILLIAM: so when you play a great show like tonight... 
DICK: okay. i need everybody's attention.
JEFF: bring him in! we'll send him out on a rail!
DENNIS HOPE: hi.
RUSSELL: we already have a manager. he's been with us from the beginning.
DENNIS HOPE: respectfully. we all have our roots. i believe in bands holding onto their roots. but those roots need to be augmented. i'm gonna tell you the truth - i may enrage some and enthrall others. i don't really give a your manager here
JEFF: doris is the soul of this band! that bus has been our home since we were the jeff bebe band.
DENNIS: hey man -- it's travel on a

WILLIAM: anyone seen russell? 
DICK: the enemy!
RUSSELL: hey! welcome to the road crew poker party. this game's been going of for two years.
DICK: that's mick - he's with the who. that's john - with j. geils. and that's richard with the eagles... and you know the wheel.
THE WHEEL: hey.
DICK: side proposition. for fifty dollars and a case of heineken, i will put into the pot... three lovely ladies, including the famous penny lane... the band-aids, who need to exit our tour before new york...
REG: it's a deal. show 'em.
DICK: three lovely ladies... now in the custody of humble pie.
REG: alright, so we owe you fifty dollars and a case of heineken.
RUSSELL: look. nobody's feelings are getting hurt here. she already knows leslie's coming to new york tomorrow. they all understand. this is the circus. everybody's trying not to go home.
WILLIAM: no, i got it.
RUSSELL: these are the rules that come with every electric guitar and every amplifier. they're not just

DICK: happy birthday from us. 
RUSSELL: so penny our friend has gained another year. but long ago, she threw it in gear. she rocked the south the east and west. could you please get off this endless tour where we're black sabbath's special guest? laughter. russell she says she's retired though we've heard that before. she chose us... and in penny lane we trust she is a fan of this band. much more so than us.

PENNY: so it wasn't a birthday party, it was a farewell. 
WILLIAM: what's that?
PENNY: you're worried about me and russell.
WILLIAM: yeah. i gotta work on that.
PENNY: you're so sweet. -- if there was more of you in him...
WILLIAM: don't tell me this stuff. i want to like him.
PENNY: did you miss your test or something? he shakes his head. it's so beyond a test. penny i know i'm not on the plane, and i'm not going on
PENNY: forget it. i'm flying to new york myself. i have a bunch of partial tickets. i know his ex-wife, current girlfriend's going to be there - william's eyebrows rise. she examines his face for clues.
WILLIAM: -- i'm not sure that's a good idea.
PENNY: what? what are you saying? what do you know? did russell say something?
WILLIAM: i don't know anything.
PENNY: i know he wants me there. he gave me a cake. he wrote me that sweet poem.
WILLIAM: wake up! don't go to new york!
PENNY: what are you telling me?
WILLIAM: because you're not who you said you were! i thought you were retired!
PENNY: you're right. i'm not who i said i was. i'm just like you. i love music, so this is my family. some people like tractors, and they hang out with
WILLIAM: that's a good one. tell me too much and make it not happy about it.
WILLIAM: you slept with
WILLIAM: so was steely dan! it was a crowded room.
PENNY: you make me laugh. i think i'm gonna cry.
WILLIAM: i thought we were going to morocco!
WILLIAM: when and where does the real world occur? i am really... confused here. all these rules and all these sayings... and nicknames...
PENNY: you know -- you're too sweet for rock and roll.
WILLIAM: where do you get off... where do you get "sweet?" i'm not sweet. i'm dark and mysterious and pissed-off.
WILLIAM: you fall in love to keep from falling in love.
PENNY: i don't want to go home!
WILLIAM: well, i have to go home. and you never helped me.
PENNY: yes i did.
WILLIAM: that disc-jockey in arizona got a better interview than me... and he was
PENNY: what kind of beer?

POLEXIA: who did this to us? 
ELAINE: then don't come home. don't do this to me. if you're going to miss graduation, don't come home.

JEFF: " ... skyscrapers and everything." 
RUSSELL: we showed you america. we did everything but get you laid.

FAN: i'm from the church of lenny. we bow to his will and all that it represents - the king of the king of kings. 
RUSSELL: make it out to - ?
FAN: to
JEFF: leslie!
DICK: your room is completely stocked, far away from any noisy ice machines, elevators or maid quarters. the air- conditioning is already on. and here is your security key -- by the way, you look stunning.
LESLIE: thanksi'llseeyoulater.
DICK: bags in five! cars leave for the party at six!
WILLIAM: well -- i kept thinking i was going home the next day --
DICK: i did too. fifteen years ago.
WILLIAM: ric!
RIC: it's all happening. zeppelin is at the plaza. so's four other bands. they're partying up there right now. sapphire, and miss penny lane too... she wants you to call her. they're all staying under the name emily rugburn. william takes in the information, while regarding ric's new custom shirt, which features the words to zeppelin's "the rain song."
RUSSELL: after the party. i'll come to your room - i promise. we'll talk. this is leslie, by the way. leslie, this is our wayward friend from
CLERK: william miller? sir, you have an urgent call from a mr. "ben fong-torres." he's holding for you, right now.
WILLIAM: hello.

WILLIAM: i have some good news.
RUSSELL: -- i'll to that. follow me.

RUSSELL: dennis hope took me aside, and wants to manage me solo. says to lose the band by february. should i do it? i have no perspective anymore. william pees in silence. russell at what point do i just take the hint? nobody loves this band. people like us, do they love us? 
WILLIAM: i do.
RUSSELL: oh - get this - somebody told penny lane i sold her for beer. the network of these chicks! like i would do that. it's jeff who told her, right? not you, right? none of these guys can just calm down and be a

WILLIAM: you guys -- you guys -- you're gonna be on the cover of 
WILLIAM/DICK: she's with me.

POV WILLIAM: he looks in the backs of cabs. none of them her. 
WILLIAM: emily rugburn, please.

WILLIAM: hi. i'm a friend of penny lane's. 
MUSICIAN # 1: aren't we all - musician types are leaving.
WILLIAM: where is she?
ROOM SERVICE GUY: can somebody sign for this? william does. room service guy thank you mr. rugburn.
ENGLISH MUSICIAN: she's sick. let's get out of here.
ENGLISH MUSICIAN # 2: she used to be so much more together.
WILLIAM: what happened?
PENNY LANE: i'm not good at goodbyes. she sags. he grabs the phone. penny lane you're the last of my old-time friends. polexia went to england with deep purple... can you believe that? even sapphire's out someplace else. all she left was her quaaludes.
WILLIAM: oh --

WILLIAM: "in the unlikely event of a water landing... " 
PENNY: "... you will be required to wear a safety vest."
WILLIAM: keep going.
PENNY: "please place
PENNY: "and

PRINCIPAL: and now... out 
WILLIAM: "in the tragic event of a water landing..."
PRINCIPAL: and to the class of 1973, we say -- don't forget to remember yourself as you are
ELAINE: please let there be only two, because i can't get past number one.
MRS. DEEGAN: second. leave a little room for the other teachers in this world. he's out there looking for mentors.
ELAINE: he's got twelve of them. they're lined up. he's just tired of
PENNY: "... you will be required to..." i'm tired.
WILLIAM: well. now that i have your attention. and you may not remember this later, i just want to make it clear that...

DOCTOR: your wife will be okay for now - 
WILLIAM: thank you doctor.
DOCTOR: however, she says you're her brother.
WILLIAM: she's a little confused.
DOCTOR: nice champagne.
WILLIAM: i don't have a driver's license. with me.
DOCTOR: tomorrow's my wedding anniversary. i'd prefer to take care of this without facing the dawn at the police station. so if you can find a way to get this girl - your wife - back home to her parents, i'd let you pay me anything you can afford. because you don't appear to be related to the famous rugburns of rhode island.
WILLIAM: happy anniversary.
DOCTOR: she won't be good company, but keep her awake for another four hours.

PENNY: when i was 14, my mom and her boyfriend took me to a rolling stones concert - and i freaked out and i rushed up to the front of the stage and then a thousand people had the same idea at the same time and i was getting crushed. and i couldn't breathe and that thought flashed through me - almost like a car accident - i thought i might die. and it was in the middle of "midnight rambler" and keith richards saw me. and he came over, and came to the front of the stage, and he pulled me out. and they took me backstage and they gave me coke with ice and a - and a lemon. and i never went home. 
WILLIAM: what about your mom?
PENNY: she always said - "marry up." marry someone lady?
PENNY: lady goodman.
WILLIAM: no.
PENNY: you never really get used to it, either.
WILLIAM: well -- this -- this just explains
WILLIAM: hey lady!

RUSSELL: why didn't you come back to the party? bob dylan showed up. he was sitting at our table for... had to be an hour, right? just 
WILLIAM: it's a log story.
RUSSELL: "peggy sure... peggy sue... "
DICK: please.
RUSSELL: "pretty pretty pretty pretty peggy sue... " a moment of laughter, and then
RUSSELL: doris, we miss you!
PILOT'S VOICE: this is craig, your pilot. it appears we've caught the edge of that electrical storm we were trying to outrun. buckle up tight now. we're gonna do our best to getcha out of this.
JEFF: "electrical storm?"
RUSSELL: rock and roll.
CO-PILOT: we're gonna try to land in tupelo. we're going to have to cut the inside lighting for the next several minutes. we found a field to land in.
DENNIS HOPE: a field?
JEFF: i can't breathe.
CO-PILOT: it might be a rough set-down. we should be fine. but what we do say in a situation like this is - we would pass but before the plane ... disassembled. however, help us, if there's anything you want to say to each other, any secrets, anything like that, now would be a good time. but just hang in there. we'll get you out of this.
DICK: and everyone thinks it's so glamorous out here.
LARRY: he just told us we're gonna die.
JEFF: we're gonna crash in elvis' hometown --
RUSSELL: shut up.
JEFF: -- we can't even die in an original city!
RUSSELL: c'mon dennis, get us a better city.
LESLIE: oh my
PUSH IN ON WILLIAM: just shaking. nearly in tears. hyperventilating.
RUSSELL: if something should happen. i love all of you. i don't think we have to do the secrets thing.
DENNIS HOPE: i once hit a man in dearborn, michigan. a hit-and-run. i hit him and kept on going. i don't know if he's alive or dead, but i'm sorry.
RUSSELL: i slept with marna,
JEFF: i did too.
LARRY: i waited until you broke up with her.
JEFF: i also slept with leslie, when you were fighting.
RUSSELL: you... slept with jeff?
LESLIE: yes, but it didn't count. it was the summer we decided to be free of all rules.
RUSSELL: and you say you "love me."
JEFF: i don't love you, man. i never did.
RUSSELL: please. enough.
JEFF: none of us love you. you act above us. you always have!!
LARRY: finally. the truth.
JEFF: you just held it over us, like you light leave... like we're
LESLIE: i don't want to hear anymore. shut up! shut up! whatever happens, you're dead.
JEFF: don't be self-righteous, russell, not now. you were sleeping with penny, that groupie. last summer.
WILLIAM: "that groupie?" she was a
CO-PILOT: thank above, we're alive!! we're

RECEPTIONIST: leave your package at the desk. 
WILLIAM: i'm not a messenger. i'm one of your writers. william miller.

BEN: you're william miller? 
WILLIAM: yep.
BEN: oh baby.

JANN: we can't run this piece. 
BEN: you obviously saw more than you wrote about. after eight days on the road with these guys.
DAVID FELTON: didn't anything happen?
JANN: and where are
JANN: we can push up chet's who cover -
FACT CHECKER: good 'cause it's going to take me three days to get through this research. it's all handwritten, on little slips. plus, they all refer to woman as "chicks." i mean, as a woman i have a problem with that. i know it's a side issue.
DAVID FELTON: it's a "puff piece." you fell for 'em. it happens. a relationship forms. you want them to like you. happened with me and charlie manson.
FACT CHECKER: chet's piece is all fact-checked and ready.
JANN: get some sleep. we'll do another story sometime. we'll get you a kill fee.
FACT CHECKER: his research is all on
JANN: let him use the big office. it's where hunter used to write.
FACT CHECKER: you can type.
WILLIAM: yes. it took it in

WILLIAM: well, it was fun. 
LESTER BANGS: they make you feel cool. and hey. i met you. you are not "cool."
WILLIAM: i know. even when i though i was, i knew i wasn't.
LESTER BANGS: that's because we are uncool! and while women will always be a problem for guys like us, most of the great art in the world is about that
LESTER BANGS: yeah, great art is about conflict and pain and guilt and longing and love disguised as sex, and disguised as love... and let's face it, you got a big head start.
WILLIAM: i'm glad you were home.
LESTER BANGS: i'm always home! i'm uncool!
WILLIAM: me too!
LESTER BANGS: the only true currency in this bankrupt world if what we share with someone else when we're uncool.
WILLIAM: i feel better
LESTER: my advice to you. i know you think those guys are your friends. you want to be a true friend to them?
LESTER BANGS: be honest and

FELTON: read me the opening line. 
BEN: "i am flying high over tupelo, mississippi, with america's hottest band, and we are all about to die."
FELTON: mmmmm. dark. lively.
BEN: yeah, and it gets better. did this all really happen?
FACT CHECKER: give it to me. i'll call and check the quotes.

JEFF: look. let's just piece together our information... because the fact-checker asked us all about different parts of the story. 
TONY: what did he write about? what's he using?
JEFF: it. all. he's using it all.
RUSSELL: so what?
JEFF: so what? we come off like amateurs... some average band... trying to come to grips, jealous and fighting and breaking up - we're buffoons!
RUSSELL: maybe we just don't see ourselves the way we really are.
JEFF: he was supposed to be our friend.
RUSSELL: i told him to write what he wanted.
TONY: by the way, he has you on acid, screaming "i am a golden god" from a fan's rooftop.
RUSSELL: oh my
JEFF: they used him to us.
RUSSELL: i didn't say "golden god." or did i?
DICK: we never took him seriously, and now it's serious.
RUSSELL: i liked him as a person.
JEFF: he was never a "person!" he was a journalist!
RUSSELL: you. you had the right idea all along.
DENNIS HOPE: how about the plane flight?
DICK: it's all in there. but don't worry, it's all unspecific who say what. no names are mentioned in the more embarrassing sequences, it's just completely obvious who's who! we're silence.
RUSSELL: i forgot he was there.
DENNIS HOPE: well, they haven't talked to russell - he can always deny the key stuff to the fact checker. then they can't print it.
JEFF: is that true?
DENNIS HOPE: it's war, my friend. if you'd met me earlier, he would have never been on the around. dennis hands russell the phone. dennis hope he'll live.

FACT CHECKER: the band just denied 90% of the story. it's a fabrication. 
WILLIAM: did you talk to russell?
FACT CHECKER: russell hammond is the one who denied it.
BEN: crazy.
FACT CHECKER: we're going with the who - !
SOMEONE'S VOICE: he's just some
FELTON: powerful word. strong. final.

RUSSELL: i feel bad. 
SAPPHIRE: well, at least you feel. that puts you in a higher class of
RUSSELL: what did i do?
SAPPHIRE: well - you can do what the big boys do. nothing.
RUSSELL: yeah.
SAPPHIRE: you believe these new girls? none of 'em take birth control, and they eat all the steak.
SAPPHIRE: the quaalude incident. yeah, it wasn't pretty. she could have died. i always warned her about letting too many guys fall in love with her. i guess i was wrong. on of 'em saved her life.
RUSSELL: well, it's finally over with leslie.
SAPPHIRE: let her retire. you want to lock her up in a house in michigan?
RUSSELL: i'm not going to blame myself. i do make people happy. they just shouldn't get to know me... 'cause it appears to spoil everything.
SAPPHIRE: don't be so easy on yourself.
RUSSELL: what gives you the right to get this personal with me.
SAPPHIRE: let's not reminisce.

ANITA: william? brother! 
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT: "the
MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT: nice to finally meet you.
FEMALE ATTENDANT: you have a good day!
ANITA: you look awful, but that's
ANITA: hey. i'll take off work. let's have an adventure together. you and me, finally. anywhere you want to go.

ANITA: this is not my idea of a good time. 
WILLIAM: just get me to my bed.

ANITA: what are we going to do about him? 
ELAINE: i don't know. whatever happened to him, i just wish it could have happened to me.
ANITA: the magazine killed his story.

RUSSELL: hi, i'm russel hammond. 
SECRETARY: you're here regarding?
RUSSELL: my life.

RUSSELL: i don't care what happens. i don't care if you put us on the cover. but you sent us a kid and... and he was a fan. and we all made friends with him - absolutely, to get a good story. but then we actually liked him. we thought he's... show us our lives in some mythic way and i guess... we're not mythic. we panicked. 
JANN: you denied most of the story.
RUSSELL: yeah, well, here's the problem with the truth. it's too true -
BEN: well, we appreciate the visit. the last time an artist came here, it was buddy miles and he punched me.
RUSSELL: i'm not punching anybody.
JANN: it's too late. we're going with a different cover.
RUSSELL: thank
RUSSELL: maybe so. but forbid, the day comes when selling yourself is as important as the music you make. you might have died at the right time, my friend.
JANN: thank you for visiting. good luck.
RUSSELL: do what you want, but the story is true.
LONG SHOT RUSSELL: at the entrance. raises his hand. russell good evening!

ANITA: they're called pancakes. who knows when we'll be together again. splurge. it's what most people call breakfast. 
ELAINE: i went through your records. and i found a song to play for you.
ON SIDEWALK: bam. a bundle of bound
