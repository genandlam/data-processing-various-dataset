speaker1: left pocket. 
speaker2: our banks certainly doesn't want to discourage harris enterprises from investing in california. we think this is a great new venue for you but you've got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing. with the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk.
speaker3: look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. we have over a thousand man hours in this deal.
speaker4: this is a "no brainer". there's no risk for you. no one has ever lost money backing mr. harris.
speaker5: not yet. but ship building is a new endeavor for you...
speaker4: come on. you know we're not going to go into ship building. besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us!
speaker6: bill, be reasonable. if you're really going to digest kross industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem. besides, i don't think there's anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have.
speaker1: it's unacceptable.
speaker1: draymen heux has offered me seventy-five in the pool at sixteen and a half. i can secure the other half personally. you have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer.
speaker1: the meeting is over, gentlemen.
speaker4: hah! did you see the look on their faces?
speaker3: you don't think we pushed too hard?
speaker4: no way! they'll come back. they can't afford not to. edward, that bluff was beautiful.
speaker1: maybe i should have made it rhyme.
speaker1: well! it's late. we've been at this long enough.
speaker1: gentlemen, enjoy the party. the magician's wonderful.
speaker1: watch your left pocket.
speaker7: phone call, mr. harris. it's miss charles.
speaker4: cynthia? is she coming out?
speaker1: we're about to find out. go on. take care of your guests.
speaker1: where are you, cynthia? i see. no, i don't expect you to be at my beck-and-call. are you coming or not?

speaker1: prepare the filing papers. have them ready by the middle of the week. i'll tell you when to submit them.

speaker1: at least stay for a drink. this party's for you.
speaker2: apologize to elizabeth for me.
speaker1: listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
speaker2: really? some high class gold digger who speaks french better than i do? no, thank you. i just got off the phone with one.
speaker1: cynthia's not coming?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: let your driver take you. we'll move the cars...
speaker1: can you drive a stick?
speaker1: edward, give me a break!
speaker2: love this car! is it new?
speaker1: yes! and you don't even know where you're going!

speaker1: very good. you ought to have that printed up on your business card.
speaker2: if you're making fun of me, i don't like it.
speaker1: sorry. if i did, i didn't mean to.
speaker1: ugly habit, biting your nails.
speaker2: you don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
speaker2: okay, pull over. let me out. i've got to get back to work.
speaker1: what do you charge for company, vivian?
speaker2: company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
speaker1: for the whole night?
speaker2: for an hour.
speaker1: you're joking.
speaker2: i never joke about money.
speaker1: neither do i. a hundred bucks an hour though. that's pretty stiff.
speaker2: no, but it's getting there.
speaker1: vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
speaker2: you couldn't afford it.
speaker1: try me.
speaker2: three hundred.

speaker2: here we go edward.

speaker1: my raincoat's in the back. put it on. 
speaker2: why?
speaker1: you may feel more comfortable. this is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
speaker2: you mean they don't have hookers.
speaker1: every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
speaker2: off the boulevard.

speaker1: -- and a bowl of strawberries. thank you.
speaker1: impressed?
speaker2: you kidding? i come here all the time. as a matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour.
speaker1: want to know something? i don't quite know. i hadn't planned this.
speaker2: do you plan everything?
speaker1: always.
speaker2: well, the meter's running, it's your money. speaking of which, cash'll do. in advance.
speaker1: fair enough.
speaker1: let's talk some more first.
speaker2: right. so! in town on business?
speaker1: uh-huh.
speaker2: let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
speaker1: and why do you say that?
speaker2: i dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
speaker1: sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
speaker2: i've known a lot of everybody.
speaker1: champagne.
speaker2: hey. i might as well make myself useful.
speaker3: where would you like it?
speaker2: where would we like it?
speaker1: where would we like it? here'll be fine.
speaker2: what are you looking at?
speaker1: i think he wanted you to tip him.
speaker2: tsk. excuse me, i didn't think he had change for a hundred.
speaker1: i have both.
speaker2: where are they? shopping together?
speaker1: they should be. they're both good at it.
speaker1: it's a very good year.
speaker2: oooh, thank
speaker1: try a strawberry.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
speaker2: you act like you're seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
speaker1: vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
speaker1: you really are a very beautiful girl.
speaker2: just a romantic, that's you.
speaker1: yes...
speaker2: me too. he's about to kiss her... vivian not on the lips.

speaker1: what do you like? 
speaker2: if i want you to turn me on i'll pay you three hundred. just lay back and let me drive.

speaker1: sorry. go ahead. 
speaker2: kross knows we're after his company. he wants to talk with you. i don't think you should.

speaker1: i want to. 
speaker2: edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal.
speaker1: i'll see him alone. everyone knows you're my muscle. we'll make it social. tell kross i'll meet him for dinner. tonight if you can arrange it.
speaker2: you shouldn't go alone. he might claim that you tried to black mail him.
speaker1: bill, we're businessmen, not the mafia. i'll see you in the office. by the way, about your car...
speaker2: oh, what?
speaker1: i'll bring it back.
speaker1: good morning.
speaker3: you didn't wake me. i'll be out of here in a minute.
speaker1: no hurry. would you like some breakfast?
speaker3: only if you do.
speaker1: did you sleep well?
speaker3: yeah. too good. i forgot where i was.
speaker1: occupational hazard?
speaker3: where'd you go?
speaker1: i took the couch. i had some work to do. about last night...
speaker3: oooh, baby, you were the best.
speaker1: mmm, i could tell.
speaker3: i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
speaker1: i'd say you give a good dollar value.
speaker1: do you ever... enjoy it?
speaker3: i like guys if that's what you're asking. not that i trust'm.
speaker1: no? why's that?
speaker3: "occupational hazard". a moment. edward chuckles. vivian grins. vivian what do you do anyway?
speaker1: i buy companies.
speaker3: no they expensive?
speaker1: the one i'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
speaker3: ... dollars? he nods. this time vivian is impressed. vivian you are major league, baby. your mother must be very proud.

speaker1: so what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm? 
speaker2: i sell them.
speaker1: what? why? she undoes his knot and starts over. vivian at ease, let me do that. part of the all night services.
speaker2: by breaking up a company's assets

speaker1: what are assets? 
speaker2: vivian --
speaker1: c'mon, i might buy a company some day.
speaker2: assets are anything of value a company owns. sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. by selling them off, i make a profit.
speaker1: sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
speaker2: not... quite.
speaker1: there, see? now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
speaker2: where'd you learn to do this?
speaker1: i the debate team in high school. tsk. i had a grampa. he liked ties on sundays. you mind if i take a swim in your bathtub before i hit it?
speaker2: don't drown.

speaker1: you could hold a pep rally in here! 
speaker2: yes.
speaker3: edward, it's me. kross is all set for tonight.
speaker3: listen, i gotta say this again, i don't like you going alone.
speaker2: i'm a big boy.
speaker3: let me at least get you a date. keep it social.
speaker3: edward, did you hear me?
speaker2: i'm here.
speaker3: i know a lot of nice girls.
speaker2: i have one.
speaker2: all right. how much for the week?
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i'm in town until saturday.

speaker1: it'd cost you.
speaker2: of course. how much?
speaker1: five full nights... days too?
speaker1: four thousand.
speaker2: vivian, may i point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
speaker1: but you want days too.
speaker2: all right, two thousand.
speaker1: three.

speaker1: look butthead, i'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
speaker2: three thousand for five days.

speaker1: i'll be out most of the day. 
speaker1: i want you to go out and buy some decent clothes. vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money.
speaker1: nothing too flashy, not too sexy.
speaker2: yeah, you want me to dress like your high class girlfriend. you're wasting your money though. all i'm gonna do is hang around the hotel. as a matter of fact, i may never get out of that bathtub.
speaker1: think again. i'm taking you out to an important dinner with me tonight.

speaker1: what? are you crazy? 
speaker2: probably.

speaker1: three thousand... 
speaker1: three thousand!
speaker2: 'lo.

speaker2: why'd he want you?
speaker1: he... he just does.
speaker2: i'm sorry, viv'. carlos has been on my back. did you get the money up front like i taught ya'?
speaker1: three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes. now listen, i'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that landlord for part of the rent. spend it on drugs and i'll pull your hair out.
speaker2: i'm getting dressed now. i'll be over. bye.

speaker1: are you looking for something in particular?
speaker2: yes. something... conservative.
speaker1: yes...
speaker2: you have beautiful things. how much is this?
speaker1: i don't think it would fit you.
speaker2: i didn't ask if it would fit.
speaker1: it's very expensive.
speaker2: what is with you?
speaker1: excuse me?
speaker2: i'm going to spend money.
speaker1: i don't think we have anything for you here. you're obviously in the wrong place.

speaker1: may i help you miss? 
speaker2: i'm just going to my room.
speaker1: you're a guest here?
speaker2: i'm -- i'm with a friend.
speaker1: and who is that?
speaker2: i... edward...
speaker2: he knows me.
speaker1: do you know this young lady?
speaker3: she's with mr. harris.
speaker1: mr. harris?
speaker3: she apparently joined him last night.
speaker1: why don't you come with me. we'll chat for just a moment.

speaker1: what's your name? 
speaker2: vivian.
speaker1: miss vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the regent beverly wilshire. vivian says nothing. mr. thomas mr. harris, however, is a very special customer. and we like to think of our special customers as friends. as a customer, we would expect mr. harris to sign in any additional guests. but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it, i'm assuming you're a... relative? vivian finds herself nodding. mr. thomas i thought so. you must be his...?
speaker2: niece?
speaker1: of course. naturally when mr. harris leaves, i won't see you in this hotel again. vivian bites her lower lip, nods. mr. thomas good. we understand one another. i would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner.
speaker2: that's what i was trying to do.
speaker1: women's clothing. bridget, please. vivian is staring at him. mr. thomas bridget, hello, this is barnard thomas over at the regent beverly wilshire. well, thank you, that's flattering. i'd like to ask a favor of you. i'm going to send someone over. her name is vivian. she's a guest of ours. a very special guest.
speaker2: barney.

speaker1: okay... this is the jewel in kross's crown. we can strip out all the heavy equipment. some of the cranes are very valuable overseas. the japanese are salivating for them. 
speaker2: prime industrial property straddling the port of long beach and los angeles. it gives me a hard-on.
speaker3: what's that long building over there?
speaker4: storage, i think.
speaker3: not with those smokestacks it's not.
speaker1: let me check.
speaker4: the real estate possibilities are endless. most of the yard we'll just level. i talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said

speaker1: you what? 
speaker2: i talked to some developers about the land.
speaker3: what kind of an are you? you don't talk about this to anyone.
speaker2: they're close friends, they'd never breathe a word --
speaker3: where did you dig this moron up?
speaker4: he's right, jake, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do. it won't happen again, edward. i'll pull him off the project immediately.
speaker1: don't bother.
speaker3: what!?
speaker1: we don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. besides... you've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
speaker2: it won't happen again, mr. harris.
speaker4: this is interesting. that building is storage now, but it used to be a smelting plant. they closed it down after world war

speaker1: i want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them right away. i want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them. 
speaker2: yes. it's a long shot but if the permits are still in effect, they're worth a fortune.
speaker1: what time's diner tonight?
speaker2: eight o'clock. kross is bringing his son. very bright kid, watch yourself with him. who's this girl you're taking?
speaker1: no one you know.

speaker1: you must be vivian. vivian nods. bridget let's look at you... 
speaker2: georgia.
speaker1: no wonder. for starts, you should know that hot pants are horrid, even when you do have the legs to carry them off. what are your plans while you're in town?
speaker2: well... i might be going out to dinner.
speaker1: you'll want a cocktail dress then. turn. you have a beautiful figure. a little too out in the open but simply lovely. size six?
speaker2: i dunno. do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
speaker1: philip! we'll need shoes!
speaker1: your uncle will like this.
speaker2: he's not really my uncle.
speaker1: they never are, dear.

speaker1: i got a dress. 
speaker2: i rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
speaker1: i didn't want to get it messed.
speaker2: that's all right. i'm sure they're quite lovely.
speaker1: they were real nice to me there. they treated me, y'know... nice. thanks, barney.
speaker2: you're very welcome, miss vivian.

speaker1: hello? 
speaker2: never answer the phone. ever.
speaker1: tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
speaker2: did you buy some clothes?
speaker1: i got a dress, yeah.
speaker2: just one? i hope it's appropriate.
speaker1: it's very tasteful. i think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch. i'm -- joking.
speaker2: let's hope so. you'll get some more clothes tomorrow. i'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp. got it?
speaker1: no, i don't "got it". even the farmboys back in georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
speaker2: this isn't a date.
speaker1: go by yourself then. where you taking me anyway?
speaker2: the rex.
speaker1: any good?
speaker2: i think you'll approve.
speaker1: ... all right. i'll meet you in the lobby. but only cause you're paying me to.
speaker2: thank you very much.
speaker1: hello?
speaker2: i thought i told you not to answer the phone.
speaker1: oooh!
speaker3: housekeeping. i come to turn down the bed. 5:00, i turn down the bed.
speaker1: what?
speaker3: housekeeping. i come to turn down the bed.
speaker1: okay.
speaker1: is there a trick to it?
speaker1: is that all? you just fold back the bedspread?
speaker3: i also place las chocolates on the pillow.
speaker1: oooh, i love those.
speaker3: i leave extras, miss.
speaker1: thanks! consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?

speaker1: barney. 
speaker2: what is it, miss vivian?
speaker1: edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner. the rex. ever been there?
speaker2: it's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
speaker1: yeah, mine too. is it like, y'know, normal?
speaker2: i think you'll find it normal enough.
speaker1: will i like it?
speaker2: you'll like it fine.
speaker1: okay. thanks, barney. you're the best.
speaker2: just mind which fork you use.
speaker1: fork?

speaker1: in fifteen minutes i can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the queen. first, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand. 
speaker2: but i always eat like this.
speaker1: either you're european or badly brought up.
speaker2: hmmm... i vonder vich.
speaker1: actually, some of the richest people i know have the worst manners. of course, mr. harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table. all right now, pay attention please. salad fork.
speaker2: what if they serve soup?
speaker1: they will serve salad.
speaker2: but what if they serve soup?
speaker1: then you use your soup spoon.
speaker2: i like steak.
speaker1: then you would use your--
speaker2: steak spoon!
speaker1: miss vivian --
speaker2: maybe i'll just order a burger, barney, that way i can eat with my hands.
speaker1: miss vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel. instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
speaker2: professionally?

speaker1: i have a friend who has a friend who does cher's wigs. 
speaker2: i hate him already. all set?
speaker1: yeah... what a ya say we chop it all off and bleach the tips.
speaker2: darling? trust me.

speaker1: good evening, mr. harris. 
speaker1: barnard thomas, manager of the hotel.
speaker2: of course, yes. if you'll excuse me just a moment --
speaker1: i have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
speaker2: my what?
speaker1: the young lady staying in your room?
speaker2: i think we both know she's not my niece. mr. thomas looks uncomfortable. edward does this hotel have any problem with that?
speaker1: mr. harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly. the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
speaker2: thank you.
speaker1: very intriguing young woman, miss vivian. his tone stops edward in his tracks. mr. thomas have a good evening, sir.

speaker1: you're late. 
speaker2: i'm sorry.
speaker1: you're forgiven.

speaker1: so young man, i understand you are trying to take over my company. 
speaker2: please don't patronize me, mr. kross. our ages mean nothing here.
speaker3: mr. harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock. we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
speaker2: twenty-five percent.
speaker1: mr. harris, i built kross enterprises myself. i know every man who ever worked there by his first name. i know their wives... and their children. if your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again.
speaker2: what do you suggest, mr. kross?
speaker1: what would it take to buy our stock back? name your price.
speaker2: to get me in a mood to sell -- double what i paid. but your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
speaker3: we're on the verge of closing a large navy contract. double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares. we would give you a promissory note...
speaker2: you're not getting any navy contracts.
speaker3: there's no way you could know that.
speaker2: but i do know. i also know your lines of credit are over-extended. if i don't buy your company, someone else will... ah, the escargot.
speaker4: scume me, what are these things?
speaker5: escargot, mademoiselle.
speaker2: snails.
speaker2: mr. kross, i'm not here to sell you my stock. on the contrary, i'm here to buy yours.
speaker1: you've got a lot of nerve.
speaker2: no. what i have is a lot of money.
speaker1: i know all about you, mr. harris. when you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. even the pension funds are stripped clean. the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
speaker2: what i did with those companies was perfectly legal.
speaker1: i don't question the legality of what you do. it's your morality that makes me sick. i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
speaker2: it is not your company. it's a public company. and i am going to acquire it. either i buy from the other stock holders, or i buy from you. vivian struggles with her escargot. edward i would suggest that you and your board cooperate with me, rather than fight a battle you don't have the ammunition to win. vivian suddenly zings her snail across the table. everyone looks to her.
speaker4: slippery little suckers...
speaker1: if you'll excuse me young lady, mr. harris... deal with this, david, you know where we stand. i need to go someplace and puke.
speaker3: men like my father built this country. he was no saint. he screwed people. but for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job.
speaker4: he seems like a nice man.
speaker2: we can reach an understanding on this.
speaker3: i don't think so. you should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
speaker2: do what you have to do. i don't take it personally.
speaker3: i do. i take it all very personally. very nice meeting you, vivian.
speaker2: and that's the way the game is played.
speaker4: some game. screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
speaker4: snails for dinner. no wonder everybody is in such a bad mood.
speaker5: are we ready for the next course, sir?
speaker2: no. bring a check, please.

speaker1: thank you. 
speaker2: you're upset, huh?
speaker1: upset. no. i never get upset about business.
speaker2: you liked the guy, though.
speaker1: whether i liked him or not is irrelevant. it's business. there's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
speaker2: we're the exactly the same! kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. the key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when i'm with a guy, i'm a robot, i just do it. except with you. at your price i give my all... edward laughs. vivian let's not talks about this heavy stuff. come on, relax.
speaker1: that... is very good.
speaker2: know what we're gonna do in a little while then? we're gonna call domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza. we're gonna eat it in bed. we're gonna veg' out and watch television.
speaker1: television?
speaker2: yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound. you don't have to use your brain at all.
speaker1: i have work to do.
speaker2: uh-uh. no work.

speaker1: wake up, vivian. time to shop. 
speaker1: i still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
speaker2: i wasn't as much fun as i thought it was going to be.
speaker1: why not?
speaker2: well, you know those cold that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? it works.
speaker1: was someone rude to you?
speaker2: i had a little problem in one store. i wasn't dressed right. i don't know what to say. i don't belong there. maybe i'll just go back to bridget. she was cool.
speaker1: vivian, you belong wherever you are. i don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you. edward sits on the bed. edward people aren't going to respect you unless you respect yourself. the next time someone is rude to you, you stare at them right here.
speaker2: okay.
speaker1: good.
speaker2: come with me?
speaker2: please.

speaker1: hello. can you help me? 
speaker1: i'm looking for a dress, nothing too flashy, not too sexy, conservative. in a size six.
speaker2: do... do you have a charge account with us?

speaker1: kross came out of his corner swinging. he started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened. 
speaker2: he's a tough old son of a
speaker1: it's up to ten and a quarter.
speaker2: offer nine and a half. bring them back down to earth.
speaker3: where is he getting the money to fight?
speaker2: someone's loaning it to him.
speaker3: our contract guys are working on the kross pension funds. there's another forty million there. we can bleed'm dry.
speaker2: put the pension funds on hold until i say otherwise.
speaker3: we're letting them slide?
speaker2: i want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
speaker3: but, edward...
speaker2: do it.
speaker2: you're on your own now, vivian. i've got to get to work. be sensible and you can keep everything. spend too much and it all goes back.

speaker1: not me! 
speaker1: horrid!
speaker1: where'd you get your tie?

speaker1: isn't this lovely? i think it would look wonderful on you. 
speaker1: would you like to try it on?
speaker2: 'scume me.
speaker1: yes?
speaker2: do you remember me?
speaker1: no, i'm sorry, i don't.
speaker2: i was in here yesterday.
speaker2: yeah. that's right. it's me. i want you to know something. you made me feel terrible. i wasn't dressed right and you said i didn't belong here. well, i do. you're the one that was wrong, not me. and i want to tell you something else. i'm never gonna shop here again as long as i live. and with that, vivian turns and walks out.

speaker1: you were right. kross mortgaged everything he has down to his grandson's college tuition to secure loans from a bank. not just any bank. one we do business with. edward just sips his coffee. stuckey it goes without saying that your business means a great deal more to them than our friend kross's. all you have to do is make a call. 
speaker1: excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? first, you go soft on the pension funds. now, you're giving him the chance to get away? as of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
speaker2: come on, bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved.
speaker1: and some of it's mine. edward, his jugular's exposed.
speaker2: get the bank on the phone for me.

speaker1: hi. 
speaker1: i thought maybe you'd like dinner.
speaker2: thank you. i would. nice.
speaker1: wait till you see what i have on underneath.
speaker2: please.
speaker1: what about dinner?
speaker2: dinner can wait.

speaker1: you always been rich? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: seems like it. i guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
speaker2: easier than learning how to be poor. my father's family was wealthy. when i was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies. but then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman. and he took his money with him.
speaker1: keep talkin'. i like hearin'.
speaker2: not much to tell. i went to public school. went to university on scholarship. went to work for an investment firm. in eight years i owned it. my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after. i swallowed that company and out the pieces. one of the pieces was him.
speaker1: you still mad at'm?
speaker2: he died a long time ago.

speaker1: miss vivian? 
speaker1: you have a call. mr. harris.
speaker2: hi, baby. i'll be ready. bye.
speaker2: what do you wear to polo?

speaker1: you're really pushing it, bringing me here. 
speaker2: i think it's exciting.
speaker1: what id we run into someone i know?
speaker2: i really doubt anyone here frequents hollywood boulevard.
speaker1: you did.
speaker3: edward!
speaker3: well, well, well...
speaker2: bill, i'd like you to meet vivian.
speaker3: bill stuckey, vivian. my wife, elizabeth.
speaker1: hi.
speaker3: lots of fun people here. let me get you two some champagne.
speaker4: excuse me.
speaker1: real genuine guy.
speaker2: he's good at what he does.
speaker1: you could freeze ice on his wife's ass. she anything like your ex?
speaker2: shall we mingle?

speaker1: i simply love your dress, vivian. 
speaker2: this old thing?
speaker1: of course, a figure like yours can wear anything. you must work out constantly.
speaker2: i lead a very physical life.
speaker3: are you into running, vivian?
speaker2: i'm into walking. i walk a lot.
speaker4: you look awfully familiar, vivian. haven't we run into one another at the spa in la costa?
speaker2: well, i do often spa there.

speaker1: edward, she's marvelous. warm and witty and down to earth. 
speaker2: she is, isn't she.
speaker1: so unlike your usuals. where on earth did you find her?

speaker1: we're good together. he has to admit it. i've been just what he wants me to be. i say the right things, i know the right people, i give wonderful parties. no question, no arguments, no embarrassments. it works for both of us. 
speaker2: edward, these women here, i don't think any of'm like the guys they're with. they're just into it for the money.
speaker3: i'm sure that's true for some of them.
speaker2: i thought i was the pro. these women make me feel like an amateur.
speaker3: ready to stomp sod?

speaker1: hi. 
speaker2: hi. i never thought stomping in grass could be so much fun.
speaker3: i like your hat.
speaker2: huh? oh... yeah. s'okay? uhm... how're... business things going.
speaker3: let's not talk about it, it's too depressing. come on, i'll show you thunder.
speaker2: please, we hardly know each other.
speaker3: thunder's a horse. come on.

speaker1: hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? i am. this is vivian. you two been together long? you and edward? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: hope to be?
speaker2: it's... it's not like that.
speaker1: i see. well. maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then. vivian is suddenly silent. she looks away. david i'm sorry, am i being too forward?
speaker2: you don't know anything about me.
speaker1: i'd like to find out. you don't know anything about me either. that's why people have lunch.

speaker1: fill me in on this. how'd you and vivian meet? 
speaker2: we just did.
speaker1: come on, you can tell me. i sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
speaker2: the night i left your house, i was lost. i was looking for directions.
speaker1: and you just happened to run into her. great. what's she do? she work?
speaker2: yes...
speaker1: doing what?
speaker2: vivian's in sales.
speaker1: sales, really? that's great. what does she sell?
speaker2: why do you want to know?
speaker1: hear me out. i've known you a long time. i see a difference in you this week. like that tie. i'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. especially when i see her talking with david kross.

speaker1: she met him at dinner last night... i like this tie. 
speaker2: so now they're best friends? edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now i see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. it's too convenient.
speaker1: you're being ridiculous.
speaker2: industrial espionage is not ridiculous. edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring kross back information?
speaker1: christ, bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker. i picked her up off hollywood boulevard.

speaker1: i swear to you are the only millionaire i ever heard of who'd go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker! 
speaker2: let's drop it, shall we?
speaker3: edward! may we have your opinion on something?
speaker2: excuse me a moment.
speaker1: having a good time, vivian?
speaker4: yeah. thanks.
speaker1: all this must be quite a change from hollywood boulevard.
speaker4: what?
speaker1: it's okay. edward told me. your secret's safe with me. stuckey runs his hand up her arm. stuckey what do you charge, vivian? maybe you and i could get together after edward leaves.
speaker4: yeah. sure. why not. call me at the regent beverly wilshire.
speaker1: i just might do that.

speaker1: you're awfully quiet. you haven't said a word since the party. 
speaker2: you asshole! i can't believe what a --!
speaker1: vivian, what the --
speaker2: clean the up, take her out, huh?! what are you trying to prove!? i'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
speaker1: i don't know what you're talking about.
speaker2: i've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but i've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
speaker1: would you please calm down. tell me what happened.
speaker2: stuckey! he wants an "appointment" with me after you leave. you my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
speaker1: what was i supposed to do? i told the truth. why should the truth upset you? it's not as if you're from a convent.
speaker2: i want my money. i'm getting out of here. i don't want anything more to do with you.
speaker1: can we talk about this? can you just try to calm down?
speaker2: your friend, he thinks the only reason i'm with you is for the money.
speaker2: well, it's true. just pay me what you owe me and i'm gone.
speaker1: vivian...
speaker2: pay me! before i pick up this chair and smash your face in.
speaker1: fine. i'm only here a couple of more days and i'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
speaker2: off.
speaker1: i'll call you a cab. if you want the clothes, pack them up.

speaker1: vivian... i'm sorry. i wasn't prepared for questions about us. it was an idiotic and insensitive thing i did. i should have known that it would hurt you. 
speaker2: i'm not hurt. it doesn't hurt you when somebody on you, it just you off.
speaker1: i really am sorry.
speaker2: you hurt me.
speaker1: i'll make it up to you.

speaker1: this is no time to disappear. 
speaker2: bill? stop panicking. kross isn't going anywhere and i don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down. i'll be in the office tomorrow.
speaker1: promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
speaker2: goodbye, bill.
speaker1: by tomorrow, edward!

speaker1: good afternoon, mr. harris. 
speaker2: afternoon.

speaker1: c'mon, kit... 
speaker1: do i look okay?
speaker2: hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
speaker1: what's that?
speaker2: i don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
speaker2: this is made for a princess. i think she'd approve of you wearing it tonight. there. come look.
speaker1: edward, i can't.
speaker2: shush. of course you can.
speaker1: what if i lose it?
speaker2: you won't.
speaker1: what if someone tries to steal it?
speaker2: i'll guard them and you with my life.

speaker1: your plane is ready to go, mr. 
speaker2: very good.
speaker3: plane?
speaker2: you don't want to go all the way to san francisco in a limousine, do you? i don't.
speaker3: where are you taking me!?
speaker2: to meet some friends. rudolpho, a poet... benoit, a landlord...
speaker3: huh?
speaker2: the opera.

speaker1: i've never been on a plane before. 
speaker2: i'm glad you like it. now be quiet, i've really got to read these.
speaker2: vivian, what do you think you're doing?
speaker1: being quiet.

speaker1: sorry. you're not paying me to ask you question like that. 
speaker2: vivian. i'm paying you to be you. be you. have you? ever been in love with anyone?
speaker1: you mean, besides elvis? i'm a human being. sure. once. first time i ever ran away from home, i got as far as atlanta. i met this boy. he'd been with his parents on their way to chicago. they stopped at a gas station. he went to the john. when he came back they'd split. we sorta started looking out for each other. aw, he was sweet. and boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. the chicken hawks were on him all the time. he hated that. sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things. the two of us getting married someday.
speaker2: what happened to him?
speaker1: my father found me. dragged me home. i don't know why, he never seemed to like me much when i was there. 'cept when he was drunk, then he liked me a whole lot. i made it back to atlanta a year later. andy was gone.
speaker1: aw, but things sure look fine when you're sitting way up high.

speaker1: some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but i don't believe it. you can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time. they either love it or hate it. those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it. 
speaker1: viv? i really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it.

speaker1: if it's in italian, how will i know what they're saying? 
speaker2: i'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you. but you'll be surprised how much you understand. the music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
speaker1: but don't they have it in english?
speaker2: vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know. that's the fun of it.
speaker1: okay. even if i hate it, i'm glad you brought me.

speaker1: what am i? i am a poet. not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams. you have come to replace my vanished dreams. i dwell now only in your eyes. 
speaker1: and now she asks rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful --

speaker1: did you enjoy the opera, dear? 
speaker2: if you'd gone on about how much you liked it, i'm not sure i'd have believed you.
speaker3: i more than liked it.
speaker2: i know. i'm glad.
speaker3: did you?
speaker2: yes. i've never enjoyed it more. thank you.

speaker1: did i wake you? 
speaker2: i'm up.
speaker1: i had to call. i jus got off the phone with james kross. get this. he wants to see you.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: he wouldn't say. edward... i think we got him. his nuts are on the block and we got him. you there?
speaker2: give me twenty minutes.
speaker1: we'll be there. listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office. i want him to commit his stock to us this morning.

speaker1: mmm. hi. 
speaker2: better get dressed. we're having guests.

speaker1: here. let me. 
speaker2: one more night and you're finally rid of me.
speaker1: yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
speaker2: i have to go to new york tomorrow. vivian says nothing. edward but i'll be back in los angeles. soon. i'd like to see you again. i thought we could work out something... an arrangement. vivian is silent. edward i'll get you an apartment, buy you a car --
speaker1: what else? you gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
speaker2: it wouldn't be like that. i want to get you off the street. you'll have a different kind of life.
speaker1: i'm sorry. that's very sweet, edward, and i know you mean it...
speaker2: vivian, i've thought about this a lot. this is the best solution.
speaker1: when i was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad, which was pretty often. i'd stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen. then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say, "come on baby, i'll put you up in a great condo." she finished his tie.
speaker2: vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
speaker1: i know. hey, don't mind me. i'm being stupid. i'll think about it, okay? it's a real good offer for a whore.
speaker2: i've never treated you like a whore.
speaker1: you just did.

speaker1: mr. harris. 
speaker2: how are you, mr. kross.
speaker1: not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights. i'll get used to it.
speaker1: young lady.
speaker3: hello. hi.
speaker4: hello, vivian.
speaker5: let's not waste time here, shall we? mr. kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with mr. harris. mr. harris is now listening.
speaker1: yes. i'm here to tell you that i've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
speaker2: expected... offer.
speaker1: of course, yes. after the expected filing period is over, i'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
speaker1: i'll see you on one condition. i'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me...
speaker5: they'll be taken care of. won't they, edward? kross ignores stuckey. he looks to edward. edward slowly nods.
speaker1: i'll sign anything you want then.
speaker5: today.
speaker1: today.
speaker2: excuse me, please?
speaker3: hello. is kit deluca there? when she comes in will you have her call vivian wells at 560-30000. yes. okay.
speaker3: what did you do to him?
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker3: last time i saw him he was this strong guy. now he's beaten.
speaker2: vivian, i want you to listen to me. the man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
speaker3: right.
speaker2: it's not your concern. it's...
speaker3: business.
speaker2: yes. the man made a business decision.
speaker3: it's all just business to you. him. me. your life.
speaker2: it's what i do for a living. it's how i make money.
speaker2: i'll be back in a few hours.

speaker1: barnard thomas here. miss vivian, i wonder if you might come down to the front desk. there's someone here to see you. 
speaker2: me?
speaker1: i'd send them up, but sadly, i don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
speaker3: viv? where are you, babe? the sphincter-police won't let me through.

speaker1: yes, i'm glad you're clean but i've been calling and calling. 
speaker2: was that you?
speaker1: who did you think?
speaker2: carlos. i still owe him two hundred bucks...
speaker1: kit, i left that money for you days ago.
speaker2: yeah. i just got it.
speaker2: fifty bucks, grampa. for seventy-five, the wife can watch.
speaker1: kit...
speaker2: everybody keeps starin' at me.
speaker1: yeah... i know what you mean.
speaker2: what do you know? you look good. all dressed up. you clean up real nice. you sure don't fit in down on the boulevard, lookin' like you do. not that you ever did anyway.
speaker1: you think i fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
speaker2: where do you fit?
speaker1: i kissed him, kit. on the mouth.
speaker2: honey, you're not supposed to do that.
speaker1: i know. i stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
speaker2: oh, my you mean it was good?
speaker1: it was great.
speaker2: dummy.
speaker1: he wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
speaker2: i pray for that.
speaker1: all i'm doing is feeling lousy about it. i don't know what to do. what do i do, kit?
speaker2: go for the bucks.
speaker1: i don't care about bucks. i might love this guy.
speaker2: wow, are you in deep you know he'll break your heart. vivian is silent again. kit i blame myself here. first time i laid eyes on ya', i knew you were too complicated to be a whore.

speaker1: congratulations, sir. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: mr. kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. it's finished. you've won.
speaker1: who are you going after next, sir?
speaker2: who indeed...
speaker3: if we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... mr. harris and i would like to ask you some questions about your company.
speaker4: dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate. you're under no obligation to answer any questions at all.
speaker5: could we at least wait till after the filing period?
speaker3: mr. harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth. the price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid. the more we know, the higher our bid can be.
speaker5: it's in my best interest to cooperate, david.
speaker4: if he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh?
speaker3: that's unfair!
speaker4: you bed it is. you're everything he said you were. do what you have to do, dad. just don't expect me to watch it.
speaker5: he's young. he hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet. i'll sign your papers. and i'll answer your questions. whatever you want.
speaker2: stop. for just a moment. mr. kross, i'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. you realize that you're a target. if you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
speaker5: yes.
speaker2: if you had a... reprieve, what would do?
speaker3: i don't think there's any sense in --
speaker2: let him answer.
speaker5: i... i would take advantage of it.
speaker2: how?
speaker5: i... i don't know. there...
speaker2: i suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you? the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
speaker3: oh, my edward, no!
speaker2: i suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
speaker3: have you lost your mind?
speaker5: quiet. would i get the loans?
speaker2: this time i imagine you would, yes. hmm... with all this in mind, mr. kross, i can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can i?
speaker5: you'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, mr.
speaker2: you're very right. i think the best thing we could all do is go home.
speaker3: what!?
speaker2: have a good day, gentlemen.

speaker1: edward, what happened? what kind of move was that? 
speaker1: dammit edward, speak to me.

speaker1: well, well... hello again. i'm looking for edward. 
speaker2: edward's not back. i thought he was with you.
speaker1: no, i'll just have to wait then, won't i?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: do you want to know what he did? do you want to know what the crazy son of a did? he handed the whole thing back to kross! on a silver platter. for no reason! what was he thinking, i mean, what was going through his goddam head? why? what was all that benevolent crap? what are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation? i'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
speaker2: i think it's great.
speaker1: i bet. a lousy and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
speaker2: aw, come on, bill. it's just business.
speaker1: but what do i know, maybe you're worth it. come on, show me. let's see your act.
speaker2: get out!
speaker1: don't worry. i'll pay for it. what a you charge? huh? twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe? are you a fifty dollar whore?
speaker2: are you crazy?
speaker1: you got a mean streak in you, don't you. he tries to kiss her again. stuckey is that what he likes about you? huh? answer me!

speaker1: you broke my nose.
