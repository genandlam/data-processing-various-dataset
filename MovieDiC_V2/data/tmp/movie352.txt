ANN: darling.

LETOUR: twenties -- and tens.
ROBERT: tens!
ANN: cash machines.
ROBERT: did what's-his-name give you a hard time?
LETOUR: you mean --?
ROBERT: yeah.
LETOUR: cash before delivery.

ROBERT: investment bankers. 
ANN: these wall street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept -- like it doesn't apply. i see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling -- turned me off the stock market.
LETOUR: it's late. you staying?
ROBERT: it's over.
LETOUR: i'm gonna crash -- try, at least.

ROBERT: pick up the trash.
LETOUR: yeah -- big kiss.

JEALOUS: five p.m. a clinton transient hotel. 
JEALOUS: are they "faced"?
LETOUR: don't bore me.
JEALOUS: is it so much work to face them the same direction? you don't do it, i got to. it's time -- my time --
LETOUR: jees --
JEALOUS: we've been through all this. this nineteen-gram is a drag.
LETOUR: we pay you more, you put up with more. white drugs for white people. twice the price, twice the safety.
JEALOUS: i can't believe ann's been working as long as she has -- never busted. she's something.
LETOUR: never made any big money either.
JEALOUS: sure.
LETOUR: she blows it.
JEALOUS: you believe that? what you gonna do after she quits? how long you been with her?
LETOUR: she always says that. we'll see, jealous.
JEALOUS: she's out. you should pick up her trade. you're too old to be a go- fer. they know you, they trust you.
LETOUR: no way. i'm not the management type. i get in charge, i'll start using again -- not for me. i know music people. i'm gonna get in recording.
JEALOUS: yeah.
JEALOUS: tour.
LETOUR: what?
JEALOUS: normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled.
LETOUR: why?
JEALOUS: you read the papers? the park murder. all over the post. mariah rangel -- nineteen-year-old barnard co-ed dead in turtle pond coked to the gills. all of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. they're buzzin'. you know her?
LETOUR: i look like an encyclopedia? who knows? thanks for the warning.

ROBERT: jack. 
ROBERT: you pick up from jealous?
LETOUR: yeah, nineteen grams after four times last night. we're certainly not his favorite people.
ROBERT: we don't make the laws. nineteen is carrying, twenty is dealing. let him be stupid.
LETOUR: he took my hundreds.
ROBERT: take over for a while. i'm getting contact high.
LETOUR: who's her majesty talking to?
ROBERT: the ecstasy connection. from arizona. she's trying to get them to come here -- or, better, europe.
LETOUR: that's where the money is.
ROBERT: all mark-up -- the "big one."
LETOUR: don't dress. you really think she means it?
ROBERT: that's what she says. new year's eve and out -- no acid house, no product, no deliveries.
LETOUR: that's just her mouth talking.
ROBERT: next year -- strictly akasha.
LETOUR: "akasha"?
ROBERT: cosmetics. that's what ann's calling the company now --
LETOUR: -- this week. i don't get it -- marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd anyone pay to put weeds on their face?
ROBERT: why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose? i like cosmetics. i need cosmetics. you should come in with us.
LETOUR: you forget: she hasn't asked me.
ANN: johnny! robert! come here!
ANN: plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen hundred ex at thirty each and the delivery's here.
ANN: whatja think?
LETOUR: of what?
ANN: the face cream. almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the "almilk" formula. i remixed it.
LETOUR: very nice.
ANN: reminds me, if you get downtown stop at enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the california. what should we order?
LETOUR: how about indian?
ANN: darling, it's saturday.
ROBERT: thai. we haven't had thai in a while.
ANN'S VOICE: "hello. this is ann. if you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think."
ANN: answer that. he'll call back every five minutes.
ROBERT: the night begins.
ANN: "ped srilom"? -- it's northeastern. duck.
LETOUR: i'm going veggie. get me the "puk ob."
ROBERT: me too.
LETOUR: use it for facial cream.
ROBERT: remove unsightly hair!
ANN: laugh, one day you'll be watching me on "oprah" from a welfare hotel.
LETOUR: forgive us.
ROBERT: eddie wants now. now. his place. top lady. knows what happened to his yesterday.
ANN: you take it -- call in.
LETOUR: it was supposed to be light tonight.
ROBERT: don't you watch tv?
LETOUR: don't have one.
ROBERT: well if you were the normal stupid you should be so lucky to be and had one, you'd know it's supposed to rain --
ANN: good for the trees --
ROBERT: some farmer whacked his numerology on us.
ANN: it's started.
ROBERT: the farmer's almanac is based on numerology.
LETOUR: raining?
ANN: take a coat. and you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes.

EDDIE: le tour! -- finally. what took so long? 
LETOUR: traffic. it's raining.
EDDIE: how's things?
LETOUR: okay.
EDDIE: i need a quarter -- you got it?
LETOUR: robert said he sold you a quarter yesterday.
LETOUR: eddie. look at yourself. sit down. i've known you, what, like eight years?
EDDIE: yeah...
LETOUR: knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you up. i knew your wife -- remember her? we used to sit and talk and talk -- pressures eddie into chair.
EDDIE: you don't know what she was like --
LETOUR: this is no good. i'll sell you a gram and some downs, but i ain't gonna put you in the emergency room. cool it. go to bed. sleep it off.
EDDIE: you charge $200 for what goes for ninety on the street -- and you're not gonna sell?
LETOUR: so go to the street.
EDDIE: i'll call ann.
LETOUR: go ahead. you know what she'll say. phone's over there.
EDDIE: i'll tell the cops.
LETOUR: you. that's it. you're out. don't call again. catch you next lifetime.
EDDIE: please, tour, i'm sorry. you're right. i didn't mean that. i'm quitting anyway. i'll take the gram. sorry.
LETOUR: okay.
EDDIE: two hundred? letour nods.
LETOUR: you got downs?
MID-TWENTIESH MAN: ...but -- if there's no how can man conceive of him? the idea of presupposes the existence of that's the ontological argument. anselm. twelve hundred. fourteen hundred -- i'm not sure --
LETOUR: i've got to go.
MID-TWENTIESH MAN: let me finish. okay, if the idea of is implanted by -- the sensus divinitatus, the sense of the divine -- what is the role of human thought? not faith, thought...
LETOUR: everybody wants to talk. it's like a compulsion. my philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. they figure you can tell a d.d. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. he understands. of course they're stoned to start. if i could tie together all the hours of coke talk i've heard, that would be a lot of string. it was robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. fifty is more like it. later. narration continues as sedan drives through rain. later. a tribeca loft. letour swaps drug jargon with two n.y.u. students at an impromptu party. attractive ingenues drift by. trendy twosome, blasted, sways, to techno-rap. business done, letour turns to leave. the first student grabs his shoulder:
FIRST STUDENT: c'mon, tour, stick around.
SECOND STUDENT: yeah.
FIRST STUDENT: there's only four of us and like seven of them -- and we're paying for the dope. see her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? -- she's gonna model for elite.
LETOUR: me? i'm an old man. she'd break me like an old horse.
SECOND STUDENT: dude --
LETOUR: nah. thanks anyway. i gotta go. have fun.

LETOUR: carlos. wait a second. 
LETOUR: marianne! marianne! hop in! i'll give you a ride.

MARIANNE: john?
LETOUR: get in. you're getting soaked.
MARIANNE: hi...
LETOUR: where are you going?
LETOUR: i didn't know you still lived here.
MARIANNE: maybe this wasn't such a good idea. i should get out.
LETOUR: don't be crazy. it's pouring.
MARIANNE: i'm not supposed to be around --
LETOUR: -- former drug associates.
MARIANNE: it's four years i'm clean. no alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing.
LETOUR: i heard. i'm happy for you.
MARIANNE: it's still not easy.
LETOUR: i know. mar, you don't need to avoid me. i'm straight -- two years. it came that time. i tried to tell you. i wrote. i called.
MARIANNE: i should get out.
LETOUR: honest.
MARIANNE: but you're dealing.
LETOUR: no. i stopped.
MARIANNE: what's in the bag?
LETOUR: almond oil. you can check. look.
LETOUR: 
MARIANNE: what's that for? in case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night?
LETOUR: i still deal a little, but i'm straight -- that part's true. believe me.
MARIANNE: stop here. now. stop!
LETOUR: i won't say anything. i promise. i'll just sit here. i'll just give you a ride.
MARIANNE: goodbye, john.

TERESA: be comfortable. how did you hear about me?
LETOUR: a recommendation. somebody from work. two hundred dollars, right?
TERESA: it's a lot of money?
LETOUR: i don't care.
TERESA: i look at you. i give you my impressions. i feel your "vibrations" -- i don't like that word, it sounds phony, but i can't think of anything better. you're anxious. more than usual. your aura is very strong. i feel a very strong vibration from you. a change is coming. you're worried about money. you say you don't care about money but that's not true.
LETOUR: yeah.
TERESA: your livelihood is endangered. you're worried about the future. you don't have much money saved. what will you do?

LETOUR: no. i --
TERESA: you should exercise more. you must let go of this stress. it's not good for your health. i'm not saying you're going over to the other side, but it's not good for you. you're still drinking, aren't you? you have a drinking problem? it's interfering with your health and your life too. you've had other problems. drug addiction.
LETOUR: yes.
TERESA: this was very important in your life.
LETOUR: yes.
TERESA: you are in the balance. everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. every act, every decision matters.
LETOUR: teresa?
TERESA: what is it?
LETOUR: i'm thirty-eight years old. forty.
TERESA: you're young.
LETOUR: i have trouble sleeping. look. what do you see around me? is there anything? is it dark? have i run out of luck? is there luck?
TERESA: i see a glow. everything you need is around you. the only danger is inside you.

MARIANNE: a year.
LETOUR: your father?
MARIANNE: not this time. his new wife -- he'll make it to the funeral.
LETOUR: what have you been doing? where do you live?
MARIANNE: it's... i don't want you to know about my life.
LETOUR: anything? you married? have children? a dog? house plants?
MARIANNE: details just open the door.
LETOUR: the door to what? it's not like we're strangers. we were married.
MARIANNE: we were not.
LETOUR: there was a ceremony.
MARIANNE: he wasn't even a minister. he was an astrologer.
LETOUR: he was also a minister. "universal harmony."
MARIANNE: he was a pisces.
LETOUR: you're a pisces.
MARIANNE: it was not legal.
LETOUR: in the eyes of jeanne dixon we're still --
MARIANNE: i was on the cusp.
LETOUR: we were happy.
MARIANNE: we were miserable. we were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down.
LETOUR: there were good times. area, out on the street, laughing, dancing with friends -- we were magical.
MARIANNE: you took off for three months without telling me and called once. that's how magical we were. you were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- i heard them all. nobody could clear a room like you, john. and the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. i envy you. a convenient memory is a gift from
LETOUR: you exaggerate.
MARIANNE: in rehab they call this "euphoric recall." you only remember the highs, never the lows.
LETOUR: we were happy.
MARIANNE: i was drowning.
LETOUR: it wasn't me --
MARIANNE: you watched --
LETOUR: you jumped --
MARIANNE: you did nothing -- "it wasn't your business, you weren't responsible" -- you still think like that. actions have consequences; so do --

MARIANNE: -- inactions. 
LETOUR: i didn't -- i meant well.
MARIANNE: you always meant well.
LETOUR: we were in love?
MARIANNE: yes.
LETOUR: we were happy?
LETOUR: you bought it for me. it's inscribed inside. she pushes his hand away. details open doors.
LETOUR: ann's quitting. i've got to find something else to do.
MARIANNE: ann? i'll believe it when i see it.
LETOUR: it's true.
MARIANNE: are you really straight?
LETOUR: yeah.
MARIANNE: let me see your eyes.
MARIANNE: eyes are deceiving. congratulations.
LETOUR: if i could do that, i could do anything.
MARIANNE: what do you mean?
LETOUR: we could do anything. we could start over.
MARIANNE: what was that? i think i heard something.
LETOUR: i'm serious.
MARIANNE: you're crazy.
LETOUR: this is crazy.
MARIANNE: i have to get back.

ANN: you have any money saved? 
LETOUR: there's some. not much. a thousand or two. maybe more -- i'm not sure.
ANN: what do you do with your money?
LETOUR: i don't know. it's not that much in the first place -- as you know.
ANN: it's tax free --
LETOUR: rent, utilities, phone, tips, cds -- what about your money?
ANN: kitty ford once told me, "ann, the only person i know that lives as well as you is my grandmother." all the money i've made, all the money i've spent -- it never adds up. this last two years cosmetics' been taking everything.
LETOUR: i wish i could help.
ANN: you still go to meetings?
LETOUR: no, but i'm okay. what are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days?
ANN: ask robert to make up a chart for you; the other person -- who is it?
LETOUR: just a contact -- you don't know him.
ANN: what's the plan?
LETOUR: the plan?
ANN: what you gonna do?
LETOUR: my future?
ANN: too conceptual?
LETOUR: we had this conversation two years ago. we'll have it two years from now.
ANN: this time it's for real.
LETOUR: i'm thinking of some music courses. mixing, sound editing --
ANN: you took that before.
LETOUR: that was acting.
ANN: modeling.
LETOUR: why all this concern? suddenly you care?
ANN: i have feelings too -- you may have noticed. i guess i'm worried. i'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough -- i've seen zipporah twice this week.
LETOUR: she helps you?
ANN: nomination for best picture. i knew every girl he -- how, why. i knew when he had trouble shitting. like this. his wife says he gets straight or she cuts him off. old money. i remember the last thing he said to me: "see you soon." yeah, sure. that was five years ago. ann pulls a wad of twenties from her purse, counts bills atop the check: $260.
LETOUR: you --? of course i will.
ANN: it'll be strange without you around. i hadn't thought of it -- it hit me.
LETOUR: we'll always have paris.
ANN: john.
LETOUR: ann, you want me, call, write a letter, tell a wino -- i'll be there.

LETOUR: i'm sorry. i... 
LETOUR: i always thought my father would die first. he would die, then my mother and i would reconcile. just her and me. i hated him for living.
MARIANNE: it's like a joke. it's not a real feeling. it's like a feeling of a feeling.
LETOUR: my old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded. i miss you.
MARIANNE: you tried to kill me. you took ten years of my life one way or another. i couldn't hate my mom -- i was too busy hating you.
LETOUR: i thought i was just killing myself.
LETOUR: selfish.
MARIANNE: i remember.
LETOUR: what?
MARIANNE: what it felt like. what this tasted like.
LETOUR: i see you and my heart starts thumping.
MARIANNE: john.

ROBERT: compared to what? my thinking this or that is going to make any difference? there's a plan unfolding. "will my plane crash?"

LETOUR: come with me -- the two of us.
ANN: okay. you got it. like old times -- ann and johnny.
LETOUR: okay.
ROBERT: stop it. you're breaking my heart.

ANN: it's going to be strange, not doing this. i mean i've had it, but sometimes... 
LETOUR: you're gonna do it, aren't you? you're gonna quit.
ANN: i think so. seal this thing with tis, turn it -- go with the cosmetics. you gotta take a chance in life. no risk, no gain. i've already got retail connections here, london. it was great at the beginning, though.
LETOUR: when?
ANN: you know, when we first started out of the place on greene street. before deliveries, when you were still using. it was open house every night but sunday. we had everything: uppers, downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember? you could get in for a gram, stay all night -- everybody, music people, movies, wall street, fashion -- even politics. i think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies -- really. you stayed, you then robert -- but he... i'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years? others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable -- nice kids. remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers --
LETOUR: you made me --
ANN: -- never washed --
LETOUR: -- khaki pants.
ANN: i should write a book someday. did you know somebody wanted to do my story? ghostwrite. it was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked i even had the meeting. people envy me. they think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. i know. glamorous. it was for a while. then came crack and everything.
LETOUR: i gotta stop home a second.
ANN: why? it's out of the way. they're expecting you.
LETOUR: you know i got a bad vibe about tis.
ANN: chill. this is routine.
LETOUR: i want to get my lucky jacket.
ANN: oh. okay.
ANN: that took long enough. what did you do, douche while you were at it?
LETOUR: ann, you got some mouth on you.
ANN: you don't want to know where it's been. cologne?
LETOUR: for you.
ANN: phew. it smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. it's no good for your skin. all chemicals.
ANN: what's that?
LETOUR: do me a favor.
ANN: what?
LETOUR: don't ask why, just promise.
ANN: what is it?
LETOUR: if anything happens to me -- if i should like, you know, die -- write and tell her. extends slip of paper.
LETOUR: it's my sister. her husband's in san quentin. she worries, you know.
ANN: okay.
LETOUR: i thought we were going to tis'?
ANN: we are. he's here. he can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he?

ANN: mathis bruge, please. tis? ann. i'm here with tour. okay. 
LETOUR: tis there?
ANN: twelve-oh-four.
LETOUR: ann.
ANN: i told you greasy i don't deal with guns! i see guns, i walk! how dare you?
ANN: and you, beaner, whoever the you are, kiss my fat ass!
ANN: that's it! tis! shitball! i know you're there! let this be a lesson! you wanna deal, you gonna apologize for this! let's go.
THOMAS: hold it! stop right there. she turns defiantly. tis enters from bedroom:
TIS: no! sorry about the guns. my fuck-up. i was just trying to make a point -- i apologize.
TIS: about thomas and
CUBAN): assholes. what a nightmare. we'll make the deal tomorrow -- same terms. ann. sorry. go on, leave, you're upset. i just need to talk to tour a second. about a police matter. right?
LETOUR: go on.
TIS: tour and i need to get our stories straight. somebody's talking to the police. the guns were for emphasis, to make a point, -- ann gets it. fear hits:
ANN: we came together, we're leaving together. johnny, come with me.
TIS: thomas.
TIS: don't be stupid. get out. leave. i had nothing to do with marianne -- she jumped: she was there, then she was gone. nothing will happen to tour. ann computes, bolts out, flees, screaming at the top of her lungs:
ANN: fire! fire! fire! the fire bell rings.
TIS: i didn't --

LETOUR: hello. 
ANN: hi.
LETOUR: twenty minutes. you look terrific.
ANN: i look respectable. any news?
LETOUR: sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be. because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven. with time served, good behavior, parole, i could be out in two years -- maybe. i hope.
ANN: it feels like forever.
LETOUR: it's not so bad. it's a relief in a way -- at least so far. i've been writing, reading.
ANN: i love your letters.
LETOUR: how's business?
ANN: robert quit. he went back to dealing. i think he thought it would be less work, more money. it's lucky in a way i got mixed up in it -- now i have to see this thing through. so it's cosmetics after all.
LETOUR: i miss you.
ANN: me too.
LETOUR: did we ever
ANN: what do you mean?
LETOUR: you know, make love.
ANN: there was that party when everybody was so stoned, but -- oh yeah, that night you came over and crashed and we slept together.
LETOUR: we were naked, but did we --?
ANN: you had a hard-on...
LETOUR: i didn't --
ANN: you tried...
LETOUR: i was thinking about it and i realized we never really did. it's one of the things i think about. it's one of the things i look forward to. i've been looking forward.
ANN: me too.
LETOUR: something can be right in front of you and you can't see it.
ANN: strange how things work.
