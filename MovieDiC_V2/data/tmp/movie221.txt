RAY: duh? no, i guess he just sniffed it out.
T.J.: christ! the glove compartment!? that's the stupidest place you could have put it.
RAY: he hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. i thought it would be okay!

VERSAILLES: we'll need the balloon payment to unload. t.j. looks at ray.
RAY: we have it, it's just that they called troy from titus last night. that's where troy works. the ski place? and anyway-
VERSAILLES: have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?
RAY: it was some emergency with the lifts. so he took off without thinking with the money. completely forgot you were coming. so as soon as he gets back-
VERSAILLES: when's he gonna be back?
RAY: as soon as he can get here, i'll just run it down to you. t.j. could crawl out of his skin.
VERSAILLES: this is the second time you've dragged me out here. if you don't come up with it by christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit.
RAY: look, mr. versales, i have a good job at all for a dollar. they're probably gonna make me a manager after christmas so i can handle the payments if you just leave the house-

7.: he gets in the car. 
VERSAILLES: call me when you have the balloon payment.
RAY: i'll call you... her voice is drowned out by revving engines.

T.J.: they won't ask any questions.
RAY: you're finishing school.
T.J.: come on, you don't think we can live on what you make at all for a dollar do you?
RAY: you're going to school.
T.J.: i bet i could make more than you do.

RICKY: where's daddy? 
RAY: he'll be back.
T.J.: aren't we even gonna look for him?
RAY: no! i'm going to work and you're going to school.
T.J.: that's it?

RICKY: where did he go?
RAY: he had to take a business trip.
T.J.: aren't you even gonna look for him?

LILA: new york or buffalo, i'm not sure. 
RAY: 
RAY: i'm not leaving this here.
LILA: i got a friend who might buy that.
RAY: it's not for sale.

RAY: what about the border patrol?

LILA: there's no border. 
RAY: i'm still not crossing that.
LILA: don't worry, it'll hold a plymouth. i've seen semis cross it. ray looks at lila suspiciously.
LILA: the only other way is the cornwall bridge and they won't let you take that. .
LILA: they plow it and everything.
RAY: this is so stupid.

RAY: what if he searches the car. what do we say about-
LILA: he won't, just remember you're white.

TROOPER NAPOLI: license and registration? 
TROOPER NAPOLI: could you step out of the vehicle, ma'am.
RAY: i wasn't speeding, was i?
TROOPER NAPOLI: just step out of the car.

RAY: did i do something? 
TROOPER NAPOLI: ma'am i'm just directing you to step out of the vehicle?
RAY: okay.
TROOPER NAPOLI: step around to the back of the vehicle.

TROOPER NAPOLI: see that. 
TROOPER NAPOLI: your left rear parking light is not illuminated.
RAY: oh, i didn't know.
TROOPER NAPOLI: i'm gonna give you a provisional citation. get this repaired in the next 48 hours and you'll have no problem.
RAY: thanks.
TROOPER NAPOLI: who's your friend?

RAY: she looks after my kids when i have to work late. 
TROOPER NAPOLI: have an enjoyable holiday.
RAY: yeah, you, too.

LILA: what did he want? 
RAY: just a blown out tail light.
LILA: that's it?
RAY: yeah.

RAY: what is it? 
LILA: it's moving.
RAY: what? are you sure?
LILA: hello little baby.
RAY: he was just cold.

RAY: come on. let's go. 
LILA: he was dead.
RAY: he was just cold.
LILA: he was dead.
RAY: okay, whatever, you brought him back to life.
LILA: that was the great spirit, not me.
RAY: all i know is kmart is closed and i got nothing for under the tree.
RAY: what?
RAY: look, i don't have time for that. i can't get deep about every little thing. i just have to keep on going. i only need one more run to have enough for my double.

RAY: here. 
RAY: merry christmas or whatever.
LILA: yeah.

RAY: what's that? 
T.J.: hot wheels.
RAY: where'd you get it?
T.J.: i called a friend.
RAY: mitch? is that the friend you called?
T.J.: no, its not.
RAY: well, i don't want you hanging around him. that kid is bad news.
T.J.: it's not like you were gonna get it.

RAY: look , mister, i got more important things to worry about than toys. i'm trying to get our doublewide. 
T.J.: oh, yeah. i forgot.
RAY: hey, you can lose the attitude. anyway, kmart was closed by the time i got off work.
RAY: what's that smell?
T.J.: popcorn.
RAY: i told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't i?
T.J.: sorry.

RICKY: daddy? 
TROOPER NAPOLI: is there a ray eddy here?
RAY: yes.
TROOPER NAPOLI: can i speak to you outside for a minute.
RAY: i haven't gotten the light fixed-
TROOPER NAPOLI: it's not about that. i just have a few questions.
RAY: sure.

TROOPER NAPOLI: this is about the woman who was with you. 
RAY: yes.
TROOPER NAPOLI: how long have you known her?

RAY: not too long. she looks after my kids. 
TROOPER NAPOLI: she's a smuggler.
RAY: really?
TROOPER NAPOLI: yes.
RAY: wow. that's a shock.
TROOPER NAPOLI: yes, well, there is that element on the reservation i'm sure you know.
RAY: yeah, i've heard about it but i didn't know she was involved.
TROOPER NAPOLI: how did you happen to meet her?
RAY: uh, i think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the wolf mart. that's where i get my gas.
TROOPER NAPOLI: i just thought you should be aware of that. she's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country.
RAY: oh my
TROOPER NAPOLI: if i were you i'd find a new baby sitter. you don't want her around young kids.
RAY: absolutely.
TROOPER NAPOLI: well, you have an enjoyable holiday.

RAY: thanks. you, too. 
RICKY: why is the police man here?
T.J.: shh.
RAY: t.j. could you come out here for a minute.

T.J.: what did he want? did something happen to dad? 
RAY: no.
T.J.: then what did he want?
RAY: did you have a fire last night?
T.J.: the pipes froze so i fixed `um.
RAY: you fixed um?

T.J.: yeah. 
RAY: did you happen to use the blow torch?
RAY: look at this. we can't live here anymore!
T.J.: it's just a tin crapper.
RAY: no, it was our house.
T.J.: so, we're gettin' a new one, right?
RAY: you could have killed yourself and your brother.
T.J.: it's not yours, he gave it to me.
RAY: put it down.
T.J.: no!
RAY: put it down.
T.J.: are you gonna shoot me now, too?
RAY: put that thing down!
T.J.: maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his own house. maybe that's why he left.

RAY: that was an accident. 
T.J.: some accident you shot him in the foot.
RAY: he spent the food money on scratch cards,

T.J.: so, he'd done it before. 
RAY: gimme that thing.
RAY: t.j. come on now.
T.J.: you can't have it. it's mine.
RAY: he was clean for 23 months.
RAY: i didn't know how else to keep us together. i mean...he's a good dad when he's not gamblin'.
T.J.: yeah, awesome dad. robs us and takes off a week before christmas.

TICKET TAKER: the game's over. they're verifying the last winner. 
RAY: that's okay. i still wanna buy a ticket.
TICKET TAKER: i can't sell you one.
RAY: i got money.

TICKET TAKER: sorry. 
RAY: i just want to buy some scratch cards.
TICKET TAKER: go to wolf mart, they sell `um there. ray walks away. the ticket taker watches her.

LILA: i quit smuggling. 
RAY: t.j. set the trailer on fire.
RAY: he didn't mean to, but the pipes froze and he got that torch out -- which i told him not to do touch when i wasn't there -- and he tried to thaw them out-
LILA: i got glasses and now i can see up close.
RAY: there's a hole in my bedroom floor. we gotta move.

81.: lila keeps walking. 
RAY: i just need one more run to get the double.
RAY: look you can have the acclaim. okay?
LILA: i don't want it.
RAY: what is it then?!
RAY: are you still mad about that baby? `cause it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. i mean who puts their kid in a duffle bag?
RAY: you're gonna need a lot of money to take care of a one year old baby.
LILA: i got enough.
RAY: yeah, but you gotta get him first.
RAY: i'll help you. you can even borrow my gun.

RAY: you should see the inside. 
LILA: how many bedrooms?
RAY: three. and it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom.
LILA: wall to wall carpet?
RAY: oh yeah. but the best thing is the insulation. the pipes can never freeze.
RAY: i'll be back. she disappears into the office.

VERSAILLES: ...what i think you'll find with the commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. there is never a need to repaint or even touch up- 
RAY: i wanna schedule a delivery.

VERSAILLES: give me just a second. 
VERSAILLES: what do you want?
VERSAILLES: is this all of it?
RAY: it's three thousand but i want it delivered tomorrow.
VERSAILLES: i told you all or nothing.
RAY: take it as a deposit. all you have to do is show up. if i don't have the rest you keep it.
VERSAILLES: can't argue with that. you'll have to sign something, though.

LILA: blow the horn. ray honks the horn. 
JIMMY: heat wave!
LILA: you got a run for us, jimmy?
JIMMY: it's pretty slow after christmas. unless you wanna to go off the rez, there's a guy up in montreal who's usually got heads.
LILA: how far?
JIMMY: twenty miles or so. but...you gotta watch out for the mounties and the surete. and...this guy deals in ya' know girls.

RAY: have you ever been there? 
LILA: a few times. have you?
RAY: no, troy didn't like to travel. he liked to work in his shed, mostly.

LILA: up there. that's it. 
RAY: can't miss that.

BARTENDER: oui? 
LILA: bruno.
BRUNO: you looking for a job.
LILA: no, jimmy called-
BRUNO: oh yeah, jimmy. okay.
BARTENDER: put your hands up.

BRUNO: okay we go. 
BRUNO: d'is way.
BRUNO: d'at your car?
BRUNO: open the trunk.
LILA: we need to get paid, first.
BRUNO: oh, yes.
LILA: you only got six hundred here.
BRUNO: you get the rest at drop off.
LILA: it's six hundred apiece.

BRUNO: that's the deal i make with jimmy, now you want to change? 
LILA: it's twelve hundred.
BRUNO: you want to make a problem?
LILA: let's just go.
RAY: okay. we'll take them. lila looks at ray.
LILA: let's go.
RAY: just open the trunk.

BRUNO: you must be the brains of the operation. 
RAY: turn around!
RAY: i want the rest.
BRUNO: i don't have any more.
RAY: go get it.
BRUNO: give it to her.
LILA: let's get out of here. i'll give you the rest of the money.
RAY: no. but thanks.

LILA: you're gonna get us all killed. 
RAY: put it there.
RAY: he shot me.
LILA: you should'a just taken the money from me?
RAY: i'm tired of people stealing from me. is it all there?
LILA: we gotta get outta here, first.
RAY: just count it and make sure it's all there!
RAY: is it there?

LILA: it's all there. 
RAY: good.
LILA: slow down a little. we gotta keep it under the speed limit. ray smiles and wipes away the blood.
LILA: we gotta get off this road.

LILA: slow down! 
RAY: i can't.

RAY: how much farther to the reservation? 
LILA: just up at the tree line.
RAY: what the hell? we're on the reservation.
LILA: they can't arrest us but if they catch us they'll take the money.
RAY: ray bounces into the woods through the trees.

LILA: that ice is black out here. 
RAY: will it hold us?
LILA: i don't know.

FORTH.: ray and lila sit perfectly still. 
LILA: we gotta crawl out the window.

JIMMY: hi mom. 
VELMA: jimmy, i told you not to bring no more half frozen people in here off the river.
JIMMY: we just need to borrow your oven, mom.

VELMA: i don't see how i can get any baking done. i'm supposed to be baking 200 doughnuts for pee wee lacrosse and now i have people bleeding and dripping all over my kitchen. 
VELMA: looks like somebody tried to blow your brains out.
VELMA: get outta here, jimmy. they gotta strip down. gimme those jackets.
VELMA: somebody's been beatin' up on you.

THREE RIVERS: hi, rosalie. 
ROSALIE: billy.
THREE RIVERS: we have a situation with a couple smugglers. they got chased by the quebec police and crossed the river but their car went in and now the troopers know they're on the rez.
ROSALIE: who is it?

THREE RIVERS: lila littlewolf and some white woman. 
ROSALIE: what do the troopers want?
THREE RIVERS: a surrender of the two illegals and the non-native smuggler. they need an example here.
ROSALIE: do you know where they are?
THREE RIVERS: probably over at velma's.
ROSALIE: what do you think?
BARBARA: turn them in.
ROSALIE: what about lila littlewolf?
BERNIE: we got our own court system.
ROSALIE: we don't charge people with smuggling.
BARBARA: maybe we should.
BERNIE: if we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the rez.
BARBARA: we can expel her.
BERNIE: you can't start throwin' mohawks off the rez, rosalie. there's only, what, six thousand of us as it is.
ROSALIE: she makes the mohawk people look bad.

BERNIE: but she has a mohawk son. 
ROSALIE: she cost us a mohawk son.
BERNIE: jake was a big boy. he knew what he was doin'
ROSALIE: she'll never be anything but a smuggler.
BERNIE: we've had smuggling on the rez since al capone.
ROSALIE: then we'll take a vote.

JIMMY: hi, billy. 
THREE RIVERS: velma, seen any smugglers tonight?
JIMMY: come on, billy, you never bothered with smugglers before.
THREE RIVERS: rosalie is worried people are gonna think the mohawks let in terrorists. plus, i got the troopers on my back. they want the illegals and they say there's some white lady with them too. is that true, jimmy?

RAY: i gotta go. 
RAY: no. you stay here.
BERNIE: hi, lila.
LILA: hi bernie.
BERNIE: you're in a lot of trouble.
BERNIE: the council voted to expel you.
LILA: expel me?
BERNIE: for five years. you can appeal, but you'll never be able to change rosalie's mind.

LILA: they can't do that. 
BERNIE: they'll make your life miserable if you try to stay.
LILA: they've already done that.
BERNIE: believe me, it could get even worse.
RAY: i thought this was all legal on the reservation.
RAY: look, i gotta get home.
BERNIE: if she leaves, they'll turn you in lila. the troopers want somebody.
RAY: but, she's a mohawk.
BERNIE: the chiefs want her out, so there's nothing standing between her and the troopers.
RAY: listen, my kids got no one but me.
BERNIE: if you leave she won't see her son again. ray and bernie stare at each other.
LILA: let her go.
BERNIE: lila, you're giving up on him and he's only one year old.

LILA: just go. 
RAY: at least you got family to take care of him, ya' know?

LILA: he might be better off. 
BERNIE: jake wouldn't agree with that.
LILA: it was all for a new crib. i wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. and he wouldn't let me go alone. i was too fat to get behind the steering wheel.
BERNIE: he wanted to keep you and little jake safe.
RAY: it's just a few months, right?
RAY: i got baby stuff in the shed.

RAY: get a good used single wide with insulation. insulation is the key thing. versailles will give you a hard time, but that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of months. ricky's allergic to penicillin. and you can't feed `em pringles all the time. okay? 
RAY: okay?
RAY: but you gotta get there quick, before the police, `cause t.j. will get scared. i don't want him to get scared, you know. ray chokes back her own tears.
LILA: okay.
RAY: and don't let him jerk you around. versailles, i mean. go with her. okay?
BERNIE: sure.

EVELYN: what do you want? 
LILA: i need his coat.
LILA: where's his coat?
EVELYN: you can't have him.

LILA: say goodbye to your dudah. 
BERNIE: she's gonna kill me for taking this out of her car.

RAY: how long is it for me. you know if i confess? 
TROOPER NAPOLI: as long as they're not on a watch list. four months.
TROOPER NAPOLI: i don't think you have much to worry about judging from the look of them, probably brought here to work in the trade.
RAY: will they get sent back?
TROOPER NAPOLI: not necessarily. they can apply for asylum.

RAY: can i have a cigarette? he lights one for her. she takes it, shaking. 
TROOPER NAPOLI: is there somebody i can call for you? to take care of your children.
RAY: i got somebody.
TROOPER NAPOLI: a relative.
RAY: a friend.
RAY: but i need to call my kid.
T.J.: hello. hi, mom.
T.J.: -mom are you there? what's wrong? -what kinda trouble? -what did you do? -a smuggler!? holy -are you in jail? -but are you're going to jail!?
T.J.: -yeah, okay. what does that mean? but why? i can take care of him, i do it all the time. but i don't see why we need-?

T.J.: -who? a baby? no way. -yeah i know where the stuff is. it's in the shed, but that's so stupid!. 
T.J.: -okay. bye. he hangs up.
T.J.: you're gonna have to get the little pieces up high -- or he'll eat them.

RAY: hi, you've reached ray. leave me a message and i'll get back to you just as soon as i can. 
TROY: ray, are you gonna pick up or not?
