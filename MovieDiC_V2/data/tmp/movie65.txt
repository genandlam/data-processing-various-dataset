VOICE: everybody wants to get on the van gogh boat. there's no trip so horrible that someone won't take it. the idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish one. we must credit the life of vincent van gogh for really sending this myth into orbit. how many pictures did he sell? one? he couldn't give them away. we are so ashamed of his life that the rest of art history will be retribution for van gogh's neglect. no one wants to be part of a generation that ignores another van gogh. 
BASQUIAT.: outdoor, daytime sounds filter in.
BASQUIAT.: hearing the voice, jean frowns at being woken up.

RENE: in this town one is at the mercy of the recognition factor. one's public appearance is absolute. 
RENE: i consider myself a metaphor of the public. i am a public eye. i am a witness. a head appears from the box. it's jean's.

WAITRESS: what'll it be? 
BASQUIAT: ummm. it'll be great. we'll live together in peace. what's her name? he looks up at the waitress.
WAITRESS: gina. what'll it be?
BASQUIAT: pancakes.
BENNY: hey - willie mays.
BASQUIAT: willie mays.

RENE: nurse!!! oh!!! nurse!!! carrot juice. tofu burger. rapido! 
GINA: we don't serve that - amigo.
RENE: fine... a greasy cheeseburger. fries - and a vodka.
BASQUIAT: who's that?
BENNY: the devil, man. rene ricard. art critic - writes for artforum. people read him. tell him who you are..
BASQUIAT: who am i?

BASQUIAT: oh yeah.. rene lands at the counter. jean's gaze is still on gina. 
CUSTOMER: how's the special today?
GINA: it's your stomach.
BASQUIAT: hey.
BASQUIAT: what do you think?
GINA: it's me. i've never been done in maple syrup. here's a rag.

BASQUIAT: gina? 
LESHKO: alright. look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess. he waves jean toward the door.
BASQUIAT: how about those pancakes?
LESHKO: ok! goodbye!
GINA: pipe down, lech. let him order.
LESHKO: you nuts? let him order? you on his side? you're not such a good waitress. you get out, too.
GINA: i just don't think you're being fair.
LESHKO: i need this?
GINA: i need this? gina quietly removes her apron in disbelief.
BENNY: willie mays.
LESHKO: that's right. you go with them. make babies
LESHKO: the government has to pay for.

BENNY: catch you later. benny leaves. a chilly wind picks up. jean's mood is suddenly downcast. 
GINA: what's a job, anyway? what's wrong with you?
GINA: no, don't tell me - you just got fired by your crazy boss.
BASQUIAT: i guess you did.
GINA: guess i just got sick of him.
BASQUIAT: can i walk you home?
GINA: i think i could do that alone. gina walks away.
BASQUIAT: wait, i'm in a band....we're at the mudd club on halloween. i'll put you on the list.
BASQUIAT: gina turns and looks back at jean.
GINA: i hate the mudd club. he catches up to her.
GINA: have you been camping? you could use a scrub.
BASQUIAT: i'm clean. smell me. i always smell good. i don't know why, i just do! he leans forward, offering his neck.
GINA: you do! you definitely do.
BASQUIAT: just come to the mudd club on friday.
GINA: i don't go there. too many party girls.
BASQUIAT: party girls? can i call you?
BASQUIAT: here, this is for you. i made this. he hands her the small speaker.
GINA: thanks. she admires the speaker watches him walk off.

BASQUIAT: hey, mom. she smiles slightly. 
BASQUIAT: i met the girl i'm gonna marry.
MATILDE: do you like it here?
BASQUIAT: i'd like it better in hawaii.

BASQUIAT: "she loves me. oh yeah she loves me! she loooooooves me, oh yeah she loves me!" bring me some chicken, baby! 
BENNY: would you shut the up? you hear what i'm doing?
BASQUIAT: yeah man. i'm jealous. you're always great, benny. "her name is g-i-n-a gina and she lo-oooves me." i did say chicken!
BASQUIAT: i knew i left these somewhere. one of these'll send your kids to college someday. here - i made this for you.
BENNY: thanks.
BENNY: you got a date already?
BASQUIAT: index finger.
BENNY: g'night... see you in court tomorrow.
BUM: the guy just hit me and i was on the ground!!!! boom, for real.
VOICE: hello?
BASQUIAT: i-is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?
VOICE: yes. my name is chris. what's yours?
BASQUIAT: jean michel.
CHRIS: that's a beautiful name. french?
BASQUIAT: haitian. i'm going to kill myself. i'm taking pills. reds, blues, greens.
CHRIS: what? wait a minute... talk to me.
BASQUIAT: life doesn't... make... sense. this city's k-killing me. i want my liquid hijack marlboros!

CHRIS: what? life's beautiful. depression isn't permanent. don't you believe that? what is it - did your girlfriend leave you? 
BASQUIAT: no! i have a boyfriend. he loves me.
CHRIS: you see? you have someone to live for.
BASQUIAT: no, i don't. i'm alone. we all are. especially here. the world's unjust. the respect fools get. the disrespect i get.
CHRIS: what is it you want? respect? i have respect for you, just for making this call. one philosopher said "sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." think about it. feel it.
BASQUIAT: you don't even know me. i want real respect.

CHRIS: what? what do you want? 
BASQUIAT: fame. my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.

P.A.: one philosopher said "give me my liquid hijack marlboros. life's beautiful. you have someone to live for. what do you want? rkkkk! that's a beautiful name... french? 
BASQUIAT: boom, for real.
BASQUIAT: i thought you hated this place?
GINA: i do. i just said that. i was never here before. i actually like it.
BASQUIAT: let's get out of here.

LANDLADY: miss cardinale... open up for me, please! 
LANDLADY: ohhh, dios mio!
LANDLADY: i just want the rent.
BASQUIAT: why didn't you say so? she's asleep!

GINA: what're you doing? 
LANDLADY: next monday.
BASQUIAT: wanna go get some breakfast?
GINA: a friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. he's an electrician. i was supposed to be there an hour ago. she looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor.
GINA: ohh, that's nice.

GREG: jean, could you get me a phillips screwdriver? 
BASQUIAT: a what?
GREG: a phillips head. from the toolbox.
BASQUIAT: yeah.
BASQUIAT: 'phillips head,' right?
GREG: yeah.

BASQUIAT: you don't have any!!! 
GREG: that's impossible. i've got, like, five of 'em! he comes down off the ladder.
GREG: you're holding one in your hand!!! you've never done this kind of work before, have you? see, this is a regular screwdriver, and this is a phillips head. the cross thing... i'll tell you later what all the tools are so you'll know. a group of people arrives.
RENE: i need to make a call, mary. you don't mind, do you?
MARY BOONE: certainly not. you can use my line.
RENE: to paris. bernard picasso - you know bernard -
MARY BOONE: be my guest.
MARY BOONE: jean watches the group talking.
GREG: jean? hold this, please. you'll get there. but it's good to have something to fall back on. that's why i became an electrician. it pays the rent.
BASQUIAT: i didn't know.
GREG: i sculpt. i'm really just starting to find myself. how old are you? twenty? you're just like i used to be. i'm forty-one. and i'm glad i haven't gotten any recognition. it gave me time to develop. jean watches mary and milo talking.
MARY BOONE: i can't tell you how happy i am with this show.
MARY BOONE: excuse me - you - what's your name? would you move those tools there and put them somewhere else? he looks at her.
BASQUIAT: my name is jean michel basquiat. have you heard of me?
ALBERT MILO: no. should i have?
BASQUIAT: i'm a painter, too.
ALBERT MILO: really. huh. too bad.
MARY BOONE: excuse me, would you please move those tools?

BENNY: come on, jean. get rid of your cigarette. concentrate. 
BASQUIAT: i am... on gina. - i didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
BENNY: concentrate on the ball. shoot.
BENNY: you're shattering all my myths.
BASQUIAT: about what?
BENNY: your people.
BASQUIAT: oh - you mean black people!
BASQUIAT: how long do you think it takes to get really famous?
BENNY: for a musician or a painter?
BASQUIAT: whatever. famous. to where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.

BENNY: ummm... four years. six to get rich. 
BENNY: first, you have to dress right.
BENNY: then, you have to hang out all the time - with famous people - the right people, the right chicks, the right parties. he shoots again. swish.
BENNY: and you gotta do your work all the time when you're not doing that. the same kinda work, the same style - over and over again, so people recognize it and don't get confused. then, once you're famous, you have to keep doing it the same way, even after it's boring - unless you want people to really get mad at you - which they will anyway.
BASQUIAT: come on. i hate this. i'm no good at it.
BENNY: famous people are usually pretty stupid. you're too smart. you'd get bored to death. you don't wanna be like john henry - fighting the machine. just do what you do. it's about integrity. follow your heart.
BASQUIAT: who's john henry?
BENNY: oh man! folklore guy - worked on the railroad. y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. then one day they invented a machine to do it. and he says "fuck that, i'm a man" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. it takes two days. neck and neck the whole time. they get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.
BENNY: got a cigarette?
BASQUIAT: so then what?
BENNY: he drops dead! see? just do your like you do it! your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. it's good. what else do you want?
BASQUIAT: like i said - my liquid hijack marlboros. check it out.
BASQUIAT: andy warhol. he's famous and he's not boring.

BENNY: what're you doing? you're doing something. 
BASQUIAT: he's the best painter in the world. i'm gonna give him one of these.
BENNY: don't give him anything, man. your art's worth a lot. trade. that's what real artists do with each other. besides, he'll just use you. he's famous for that.
CLOSE ON: the driver's eyes.

"REDEEMABLE BECAUSE OF HIS YOUTH.": andy stares dead ahead, sphinxlike. 
MAITRE'D: can i help you?.
MAITRE'D: sir...?
BRUNO: i think it's ok.
MAITRE'D: of course, mr. bischofberger.
BASQUIAT: you wanna buy some ignorant art? ten bucks.
ANDY WARHOL: ignorant art?
BASQUIAT: yeah... like - stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
ANDY WARHOL: ohhh. that's new. that sounds good.
BASQUIAT: ten bucks apiece.
ANDY WARHOL: i can give you five. you didn't do very much to these.
BASQUIAT: you don't even work on your stuff!
BRUNO: it doesn't matter how much you worked on

BASQUIAT: i can get ten. 
ANDY WARHOL: i'll take two. this one and... that one. can i borrow some money, bruno? bruno pulls out a hundred dollar bill.
BRUNO: here. do you have change?
BASQUIAT: you made a good deal. here, you can have these, too.

BENNY: hi gina. 
GINA: hi.
INT - GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY: flowers and groceries are strewn on the counter.

GINA: basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! what are you doing? 
BASQUIAT: c'mon, baby, i painted them for you.
GINA: i'm going to my parents this weekend. what am i going to wear? how could you do that to me?
BASQUIAT: ... i'll buy you some new ones.

BASQUIAT: do you know what he's saying? 
GINA: what who's saying?
BASQUIAT: manzanita.... ... if one day i die, and you read this piece of paper, i want you to know how much i love you. although i'll never see you again, gypsy, gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face' gina looks up at him.
BASQUIAT: 'even though you were never mine and you never will be you have a piece of my heart you have, you have, you have...' 'gypsy, gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face.'
BENNY: willie mays!!! willie mays!!!
BASQUIAT: come on in!

GINA: see you later. she leaves. 
GUY #1: nice underwear...

GINA: basquiat? 
GINA: wake up! i'm back!
GINA: jean, what did you do to yourself? she listens to his breath, then to his heart.

GINA: don't do this to me. 
BASQUIAT: ... what's the matter?
GINA: oh, basquiat, you scared the out of me. how the could you do that to yourself?
BASQUIAT: you're back.
GINA: it's monday morning.
BASQUIAT: it's not sunday? i missed you. you shouldn't leave me alone.
GINA: you're blaming me? i had to go see my family.
BASQUIAT: i'm your family.
GINA: basquiat, what did you take?
BASQUIAT: nothing special - just some weed.
GINA: basquiat, don't lie. this is smack.
BASQUIAT: you want some?

BENNY: we got beat. 
BASQUIAT: for real?
BENNY: you gonna carry that around all night?
BASQUIAT: yeah... i'll paint on it.

ROCKETS: you did that, didn't you? 
BASQUIAT: i gave it to maripol. she let me stay here for awhile.

ROCKETS: do one for me and it's free. how's that? 
ARTIST #1: check this out, rene.

RENE: oh man, you a fine nigga! you know that?
ARTIST #2: cut it out, man! and don't be callin' me that
RENE: oh my, there goes the neighborhood. who's house is this, anyway?

RENE: "the name of the game is survival, survival! survival! only the strong survive"
ARTIST #1: rene! come here, man!
RENE: i gotta go pee.
RENE: who did this? who did this?
ARTIST #2: i don't know. i told you, this isn't my apartment.

ARTIST #2: that's the same guy who did this painting. 
RENE: i know that. don't let him get away.

RENE: hey, wait up!!! 
RENE: you heard of albert milo. i made that niggah. i'm rene ricard. didn't you read "not about albert milo?" i know who to hype. baby, i'm gonna make you a star.
BASQUIAT: can you put me in the ring with him?
RENE: i can put you in the ring with him. even book the dates. but those big boys know how to fight. they
RENE: could make you look real sissy. i was looking at that painting upstairs. it's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything. so what's your real name? 'samo?'
BASQUIAT: jean michel basquiat.
RENE: sounds famous already.

RENE: oh child... you got no respect. didn't anyone teach you how to mount paintings? 
RENE: this is a very important season in new york. one's public appearance is absolute. oh!!! louise!!! i'd like you to meet jean michel basquiat - samo. this is henry geldzahler.
HENRY: ohh... samo. i've heard a lot about you. i love your graffiti.
BASQUIAT: i was a kid then.

RENE: you or the museum? 
HENRY: it's for me.

GINA: well thanks!

ANNINA NOSEI: rene hasn't stopped talking about your paintings. haven't i seen you in my gallery?
BASQUIAT: no.
ANNINA NOSEI: you haven't been by lately.
RENE: i didn't have the subway fare. my medicare ran out.

BASQUIAT: i don't know. 
BRUNO: you're doing well.
ANNINA NOSEI: i'd love to see some more of your work... where's your studio?
BASQUIAT: you name it, i paint there.
ANNINA NOSEI: well, i don't want to get mugged on a bowery street corner. maybe i could find a place for you to work. take my card.
BASQUIAT: you want a drink?
ANNINA NOSEI: no thanks. but i'd like one of these paintings.
GINA: who's that?
RENE: you kidding? that's annina nosei. jean's been in her gallery a thousand times. you slut. how do you know bruno bischofberger? he's only the biggest art dealer in europe.
BASQUIAT: i had lunch with him once.

BASQUIAT: which island of hawaii do you want our house to be on? maui? kaui? molokai? 
GINA: i hadn't thought about it.
BASQUIAT: oahu, lanai, niihau, kahoolawee -
GINA: staten island would be ok. beat. silence.
BASQUIAT: do you wanna marry me? beat. no reply.

GINA: kind of a family portrait. 
GINA: it looks done.

BASQUIAT: think so? 
BASQUIAT: ... babies.
GINA: you mean babies with you?
BASQUIAT: what's wrong with me?
GINA: you're your own baby. jean paints out the image.

ANNINA NOSEI: um... do rene and jean have a contract together?
ANNINA NOSEI: i'm interested in showing jean's work.
GINA: i really think you should talk to him about this. jean pops out of the bathroom.
BASQUIAT: when?
ANNINA NOSEI: how about right now? she opens the door.
GINA: be ready in a minute!

BASQUIAT: honk the horn again, will you please? 
BASQUIAT: you're late.
BASQUIAT: one-fourteen prince.
BENNY: what's the rush, john henry?
BASQUIAT: i ain't john henry.
BENNY: good.
BASQUIAT: what's your problem, anyway?
BENNY: i don't really have any problems.
BASQUIAT: good. what do you have?
BENNY: what's your problem? you get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
BASQUIAT: 'uppity?' like as in 'uppity nigger?' he snaps his finger for the joint back.
BENNY: that's not how i meant it. for all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! you can never tell.
BASQUIAT: hey you! i deserve this you're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!

ANNINA NOSEI: i've got to find the switch. 
INT - BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - DAY: annina flips on a light.
ANNINA NOSEI: here it is.

RENE: 3rd night i called him 'boy' he sed "don't call me 'boy'" "well then don't call me 'boss'" that was the end for us and i've been seeing him for 2 1/2 years. 
RENE: able to say i never kept a slave. but he tricked me in to tying him up and busting his face. he'll jump up at my trial yelling 'he wupped me gud.'
RENE: oh man! that's one looks famous already.
RENE: you are a willful boy. how'm i s'posed to write about you if you keep changing everything?
RENE: uh huhh... band practice? it's benny. he wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
BASQUIAT: i forgot about that. he sets his brush down.
RENE: band practice... if you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts - you don't wanna be like tony bennett..
BASQUIAT: tony bennett... what do you mean?
RENE: singing on stage and painting in your spare
RENE: time.
BASQUIAT: i didn't know tony bennett painted.
RENE: my point exactly.
RENE: so keep painting.
BASQUIAT: yes, boss. if you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
RENE: you're news. i want the scoop. i write it down. when i speak, no one believes me. but when i write it down, people know it's true. there's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
BASQUIAT: so what?
RENE: so shut up and keep painting..
BASQUIAT: what time is it?

BASQUIAT: that one's for you. 
RENE: thanks... i'll take it tonight.
BASQUIAT: i can't. after the show.

BASQUIAT: hey - it's the big a.m.. 
ALBERT MILO: rene's been telling me about your work. milo takes his time looking at the paintings.
ALBERT MILO: is this finished yet?
BASQUIAT: i don't know.
ALBERT MILO: when's your show?
BASQUIAT: not sure. how was yours?
ALBERT MILO: i haven't decided yet. rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. i wanna make a painting of you.
RENE: how about now?
ALBERT MILO: see you at your opening. thanks.

ANNINA NOSEI: tom and cynthia kruger. 
BASQUIAT: i know.
ANNINA NOSEI: this is jean michel basquiat. you've seen the samo graffiti everywhere. that's his. this is the true voice of the gutter.
CYNTHIA KRUGER: we've seen the graffiti. i work on wall street. and i've heard wonderful things about the paintings. everybody's talking about you.
BASQUIAT: yeah.
ANNINA NOSEI: here's a very good example of his recent work that's not spoken for yet. he's got to work in a basement. he's got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he'd jump right through it. most of these are reserved already. after this week, this work will not be available.

KID #1: yo, man, you're a lucky selling this 
BASQUIAT: you like it?
KID #1: not bad. yeah, i do.
CYNTHIA KRUGER: i'm fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way.
ANNINA NOSEI: yes, well, they are more meaningful in their absence, no?
KID #1: what does it mean?
CYNTHIA KRUGER: i like this one, but that green...
BASQUIAT: y'want me to make it a nice brown?
TOM KRUGER: beg pardon?
BASQUIAT: hi. this is gina. annina nods to her.
CYNTHIA KRUGER: they're something like dubuffet's... that... childlike quality.
CYNTHIA KRUGER: i can't make up my mind.
TOM KRUGER: i like this one. if it were just another color..
BASQUIAT: get a decorator. if you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids! these paintings aren't even done yet!!! he sets his brush down. as he leaves -
TOM KRUGER: i think we'll take the green one.
BASQUIAT: i'll take three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
COUNTERMAN: you want three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
BASQUIAT: forget it .i'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a big mac, and two apple pies.
COUNTERMAN: you only want one big mac?
BASQUIAT: yeah... and make it three apple pies.

BIG PINK: how can i ever thank you? 
BASQUIAT: i'd like to squeeze your titties.
BIG PINK: come on.
BASQUIAT: wanna mac?
BIG PINK: no, i'd like the scarf.
BASQUIAT: have a mac.
BIG PINK: i don't eat junk food.
BASQUIAT: oh. i didn't know. i'll take you to the best restaurant in town. you'll miss a great meal and i'll keep the scarf, anyway. what's your name?
BIG PINK: you're a fast mover.
BASQUIAT: no name? that's ok. i'll just call you big pink.
GINA: hi.
BASQUIAT: hi.
GINA: what's that?

BASQUIAT: a present i picked up for you. 
GINA: it's beautiful. thanks.
BASQUIAT: you look like an angel.
CLOSE UP PAINTING: we read the words:

MAN: jean, man!!! let's make a record! 
WOMAN: you finally did it.
MAN #2: he's so fulla
MAN #3: how much is he getting for these?
BASQUIAT: andy, man, thanks for coming. i'd like to paint your jacket.
ANDY WARHOL: my jacket? gee, great...

BASQUIAT: yeah, i met her already. 
MARY BOONE: you should be pleased. it's a great show...i'm having a dinner later at mr. chow's for albert. you should come.
ANDY WARHOL: you'll like it. everyone'll be there.

ANNINA NOSEI: jean, your parents are here. 
BASQUIAT: hi dad. hi nora.
NORA: congratulations.
BASQUIAT: thanks for coming.
ANNINA NOSEI: you must be very proud.
FATHER: i am!
RENE: how does it feel to have a genius in the family?
FATHER: it feels... good!
BASQUIAT: i'll be right back.
TOM KRUGER: we love our painting.
BASQUIAT: which painting?
TOM KRUGER: the green one.
BASQUIAT: oh yeah.
CYNTHIA KRUGER: we got a couch to match.
TOM KRUGER: she's only kidding!

BENNY: willie mays. a toast. 
BASQUIAT: not now, ok?
ROCKETS: jean michel, my man. nice party. should we step into my office?
BASQUIAT: that's alright. i'm cool now.
ROCKETS: a gift! i was just trying to give you a gift!
BASQUIAT: i gotta go.

PHOTOGRAPHER: of the painters, please. 
BASQUIAT: he said 'of the painters!' hey - albert! get in the picture!
ALBERT MILO: hey, jean, i'd like you to meet my wife....and my parents. mom, dad, this is jean michel basquiat.
ESTHER MILO: don't do that. hello, jean.
JACK MILO: hi, john... are your parents here?
BASQUIAT: well. my dad's here with his wife. my mom couldn't make it.
ESTHER MILO: no thanks.
BRUNO: i'd like to do a show with you. i'm especially interested in that one. i'd like to buy it for myself.

BASQUIAT: i wasn't gonna sell this one. 
BRUNO: you shouldn't have put it in the show. this is the one i absolutely have to have. i really love it.
BASQUIAT: sure, ok..
BASQUIAT: do you think i could borrow your limousine? i'll get it back to you in an hour.
BRUNO: it's ok. just have him bring you to dinner at mr. chow's later. we'll be there.
ANDY WARHOL: bye, jean.
RENE: you little whore! you sold my painting! i'm gonna tell you something, brother - when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! believe that
BASQUIAT: i'll make you another one.
RENE: forget it.
BASQUIAT: rene -
RENE: shhhhhh. later. "what is it about art, anyway......"
RENE: a blink. silence. we see the crowd in slow motion.
RENE: ... that we give it so much importance? artists are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get out of the slum using one's sheer self as the medium. the money earned is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual...

DRIVER: i really... admire you. 
BASQUIAT: me? why?

BASQUIAT: that's great. 
DRIVER: would you check out my studio some time?
BASQUIAT: sure. i'd be glad to.
DRIVER: here?
BASQUIAT: what's your name, man?
DRIVER: they call me steve, but i prefer shenge.
BASQUIAT: nice to meet you, shenge. want a job?

MAITRE'D: good evening. 
MAITRE'D: annina and continues towards bruno's table.
ANDY WARHOL: hi, jean.
BRUNO: jean, everyone loved your show.
JACK MILO: nixon lives in saddle river, new york.
ANDY WARHOL: saddle river's in new jersey.
JACK MILO: saddle river, new york!
ANDY WARHOL: it's in new jersey.
JACK MILO: new york.
ANDY WARHOL: i think it's in new jersey.
JACK MILO: it's in new york.
ANDY WARHOL: oh, i didn't know that.
ALBERT MILO: you finish it. he pushes the book across the table.
MARY BOONE: i hear your show was sold out already. there's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
BASQUIAT: bring him over sometime. i have some other stuff to show him.
ALBERT MILO: go on, take it..
RENE: i'd like a glass of your best champagne, please? this is an enormously important season in new york, and to make a false step could have severe repercussions for years. we are no longer collecting art, we're buying individuals.
ANDY WARHOL: oh shut up, rene.
RENE: everything's over your head, andy. even mr. chow's menu. thanks for not inviting me
RENE: i'm starving. you can't buy advertising like this. this is the most glamorous dinner you'll have here this fall. how about some of that imitation crab?
MR. CHOW: i'm not paying for the drawing with crab. it's a present to my friends. it's my birthday.

RENE: isn't he great? thanks, jean. 
RENE: he owes me one.
MR. CHOW: you're too much, rene. get this guy out of here.
RENE: i haven't eaten yet!!!
RENE: hands off me, you faggots! i'm going. i'm going...i've kept diana vreeland waiting too long, anyway.
ANDY WARHOL: wow... that was a nice drawing, too, jean. maybe you should do another one.
MR. CHOW: some other time.

INTERVIEWER: ... had over fifty articles written about you, switched galleries - how many times? - dj'd in the hottest clubs - 
INTERVIEWER: ... one of the youngest artists ever to be included in the whitney biennial, also produced a rap record. it's said you're quite the ladies man - even dated madonna for a couple months!!! all at the ripe old age of 24. one might ask: is there anything left for jean michel basquiat to do?
INTERVIEWER: what is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
BASQUIAT: i hate this. turn that off.

SUPER: "GREAT JONES STREET, 1985": a camera crew waits in the room. jean returns. 
INTERVIEWER: we're running a little late.
INTERVIEWER: ready?
INTERVIEWER: ... can you... decipher this for us?
BASQUIAT: decipher?
INTERVIEWER: yes. what do they... stand for?
BASQUIAT: they're just words.
INTERVIEWER: yes, i understand - but where do you take them from?
BASQUIAT: where? do you ask miles where he got that note from? where do you take your words from? everywhere.
INTERVIEWER: what are they?
BASQUIAT: leeches. a long list of leeches. it looks good like that.
INTERVIEWER: hmmm. and 'parasites.' you seem to be a primal expressionist.
BASQUIAT: you mean like an ape?

BASQUIAT: a primate? 
INTERVIEWER: well, you said that. you've got a lot of references from leonardo da vinci, don't you?
BASQUIAT: oh, that's a "leonardo's greatest hits" painting. you like it?
INTERVIEWER: yes, but as a black painter -
BASQUIAT: i use a lot of colors - not only black.
INTERVIEWER: what?
BASQUIAT: i'm not black.
INTERVIEWER: you're not?
BASQUIAT: not what?
INTERVIEWER: not black.
BASQUIAT: no, i'm haitian-puerto rican.
INTERVIEWER: yes, yes... let's talk about that.... your roots... your father is from haiti, isn't he?
BASQUIAT: yup.
INTERVIEWER: hmmmm. interesting. and when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
BASQUIAT: we don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets..

INTERVIEWER: i see.. and... how do you respond to being called - hmmm... - yes, "the pickaninny of the art world." 
BASQUIAT: who said that?
INTERVIEWER: why, that's from time magazine.
BASQUIAT: no, he said i was the eddie murphy of the art world. he said the eddie murphy.
INTERVIEWER: is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
INTERVIEWER: let me... just... open something up here. you come from a nice, middle class, respectable home. your father is an accountant. why did you at one time live in a cardboard box in tompkins square? jean walks back into frame.
INTERVIEWER: or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
BASQUIAT: are those the only two possibilities? you wanna french fry?
INTERVIEWER: ok. one last thing. is there any anger in you? any anger in your work?
BASQUIAT: should there be?
INTERVIEWER: tell me about it. what are you angry about? jean drifts off.

BASQUIAT: can i have some caviar, please? 
BASQUIAT: i'd like to taste it, first.
BASQUIAT: is that the best quality you have?
COUNTERMAN: yeah, it's the best one.
BASQUIAT: i'll take the whole tin.
COUNTERMAN: it's three thousand dollars!
BASQUIAT: i'll take it. andy, gimme three thousand dollars. just the caviar - i'll get the rest.
BASQUIAT: you check everyone's bills or just mine?

BASQUIAT: i wish they'd quit writing this about me. 
ANDY WARHOL: that's good. at least they're interested.
BASQUIAT: everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a samo tag on it. the other day, i just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so i did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. a week later this gallery calls me up: "somebody's offering us the drawing. should we buy it for five thousand?"
ANDY WARHOL: wow... stop giving them away. i got an invitation to model for comme de garcons... you wanna do it with me?
BASQUIAT: yeah - i'd do that... you could teach me.
ANDY WARHOL: gee. i don't need to. you're a natural. you should sign up with my modeling agent.
BASQUIAT: cool.
ANDY WARHOL: my dog, archie... i woke up with flea bites... creepy. i ran out and bought flea collars. they work really well.
BASQUIAT: let's leave this town and go someplace.
BASQUIAT: some island.
ANDY WARHOL: let's go to the carnegie museum. they have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. it's really great. it's in pittsburg.
BASQUIAT: ouch..
ANDY WARHOL: what's wrong?
BASQUIAT: that girl looks just like my old girlfriend gina.
ANDY WARHOL: do you still love her?
BASQUIAT: yeah. i really blew it. i still think about her.
ANDY WARHOL: well, have you asked her to come back?

MAITRE'D: mr. basquiat - what a pleasure to see you again. 
BASQUIAT: hey george, what's up?

GINA: so are you really friends with andy? he seems like such a weirdo. 
BASQUIAT: he's not. he's out of town and he calls me every day. what's weird about him?
GINA: don't you think he's using you?
BASQUIAT: why does everybody say that? he's the only person i know who doesn't need to use me. george reappears.
GEORGE: would you like to see the wine list?
BASQUIAT: chateau latour '64, please.
GINA: so. are you ready? i start columbia next fall. of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but - whatever. i'm really excited. and: rene gave me a job as his secretary. his poems are getting published.
BASQUIAT: how is he?
GINA: pretty much the same.
BASQUIAT: wow. congratulations. i hate that thanks for coming. i guess i just wanted to find out how you're -
GINA: what's that about?

GINA: that is amazing. what year is it? 
BASQUIAT: george?
GEORGE: i'm sorry, mr. basquiat.
BASQUIAT: see that table over there? i'd like to pay their bill. long silence.
GEORGE: i'm sorry?
BASQUIAT: yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
GEORGE: really?
BASQUIAT: yeah.
GEORGE: very well.
BASQUIAT: baby, i think about you a lot. i'm really sorry about everything. you have to believe me. i'm serious. i wish, y'know, that we were -
GINA: i don't believe it, jean - they're picking straws.

BASQUIAT: i wish you niggahs could get it togeth- ahhhhhh. 
YOUNG EXECUTIVE: what's this for?
BASQUIAT: the tip.
GINA: you don't have to be sorry. there's no one to blame. jean, you're a real artist. i thought i was one. you made me realize i wasn't.
BASQUIAT: what's his name?
BASQUIAT: i have to go to the bathroom.
BASQUIAT: what do you think?

BASQUIAT: it's always how you would do it. this is my version. 
ALBERT MILO: you're right. it's your version. you should come over to the studio sometime.
BASQUIAT: why, so you could humiliate me?
ALBERT MILO: no, i wanted to make a painting of you.

BASQUIAT: what's with the wigs? 
ANDY WARHOL: i'm going to send them to my friends for christmas presents.
BASQUIAT: you think those are good presents? who wants an old wig?
BASQUIAT: painting?
ANDY WARHOL: i wanted to make a few more of these. frank's been drinking this mexican beer. it makes a good green.
BASQUIAT: how come you're not peeing on them yourself?
ANDY WARHOL: i don't like beer.
BASQUIAT: if you ever want me to on 'em, just ask. you could finger paint.

ANDY WARHOL: that was my favorite part! 
BASQUIAT: we can do better. it needed more white.
ANDY WARHOL: jean, you make me feel worthless. you're so famous. andy paints an amoco logo next to the penguin.
BASQUIAT: i don't even have any friends anymore besides you. and everyone says "warhol?
BASQUIAT: that death-warmed over person on drugs?
ANDY WARHOL: gee. you shouldn't take it so seriously, jean. that's why you can't stop taking drugs. you always think people don't like you. everyone likes you.
BASQUIAT: people are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a thing about your work. jean paints out part of andy's logo.

BASQUIAT: when i was poor, everybody doubted i could make it. when i got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' now everyone says `he's killing himself.' so i clean up, and then they say `look. his art's dead.' i don't take drugs, anyway. i'm healthy now. jean obliterates andy's logo. 
ANDY WARHOL: if you say so. you sleep until 5:00 p.m. you call at four in the morning. you never show up anywhere on time - if you show up. you're painting out everything i do! andy paints back in part of the horse.
BASQUIAT: that's better. jean adds some letters on top of andy's logo.
ANDY WARHOL: i can't even see what's good anymore.

ANDY WARHOL: that would be a pity because you're a real painter. frank arrives. 
FRANK: here's the poster for the show.

BASQUIAT: name? 
BRUNETTE: elke.
BASQUIAT: number?

505-0236.: a brunette walks up - 
BASQUIAT: name?
BLONDE: monica.
BASQUIAT: number?

BASQUIAT: yo, frank. 
FRANK: this is really great. what a nice place. jean is taken with christine.
FRANK: have you met christine?
BASQUIAT: i don't think so.
CHRISTINE: would you sign one of those for me?
TOXIC: yo! jean, this is ramellzee.
RAMMELLZEE: yo... you know why rammellzee's here, don't you?
TOXIC: uh-oh!
RAMMELLZEE: i'm here for an interrogation. you've been called a graffiti artist and i wanna know why. all i see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
BASQUIAT: boom.
RAMMELLZEE: boom? as in ordnance? are your letters
RAMMELLZEE: armed? what is the prime directive of graffiti culture? do you know, black man?
TOXIC: man, i was up on him years ago on the irt.
RAMMELLZEE: you're selling and ending the culture. not one bit of information. only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
TOXIC: that's ignorant.
BASQUIAT: that ain't ignorant - that's just stupid. can i get you a bowl of gumbo? rammellzee yells after him -
RAMMELLZEE: this interrogation is not over! jean escorts christine to the kitchen. bruno and andy stand in the crowd.
WOMAN: albert milo? ugh! he's just a pressmonger. that's all these people do.

RENE: his early work? he's only twenty-six! 
BASQUIAT: hey, rene.
RENE: thanks again for not inviting me. i'm only here on business. rene heads back out into the party.

RENE: you're asking me? nigga, please. after the way you treated me? this is the first time i've heard from either of you in months! i had to crash this party! you treated me like a suede biscuit. rene don't play that! i can't get him off drugs! i don't even talk to him any more!!! 
ANDY WARHOL: what's a suede biscuit?
BASQUIAT: here... pull over.
BASQUIAT: the limo pulls over.

SET IT ON FIRE": jean arrives behind them. 
BASQUIAT: what's up?
KID #1: mind your own business.
BASQUIAT: that's mine.

KID#3: he's dead. that's what i heard. 
KID #2: he ain't dead yet. he's gonna kill himself. that's why all those art in soho are paying more every time we bring one of these in.
KID #1: stupid samo... hardly any of this left.
KID #3: this one's nice. i say we hang onto it if he's almost dead.

BASQUIAT: there you go. now it's worth more. 
KID #2: what's he saying?
BASQUIAT: i'm samo... i'm samo...
KID #3: he says he's samo.
KID #1: he wish.

BASQUIAT: paint it out. 
SHENGE: out?
BASQUIAT: yeah... maybe just his arms.
BASQUIAT: put some cerulean blue there. jean points to the lower corner.
SHENGE: it's andy again.
BASQUIAT: still not here.
SHENGE: - in this corner?
BASQUIAT: yeah..
SHENGE: you want me to put it here?
BASQUIAT: use your instinct.
BASQUIAT: don't try to make art. just paint like a housepainter.
SHENGE: it's maria portos. what should we do?
BASQUIAT: why don't you try letting her in, steve - i mean shenge.
SHENGE: get up. she won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
BASQUIAT: wanna bet? if you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.

MARIA: these reminded me of you, the clogs. i found them in amsterdam. 
MARIA: how are you?
BASQUIAT: fine.
MARIA: you remember ellen? what are you working on?
ELLEN: how much is something like that?
MARIA: fifteen. reasonable.
BASQUIAT: it's unfinished. how 'bout some blue in the corner?
SHENGE: blue? where?
BASQUIAT: what's wrong with you today?
BASQUIAT: don't look at me like that. it hurts my feelings.
MARIA: i love these.

BASQUIAT: well, that's better. you can buy direct from me. 
ELLEN: look at these - silkscreens? what're you? andy warhol junior? it's like - not even handmade anymore.

MARY BOONE: jean michel... crawling from the wreckage? 
BASQUIAT: i need a dealer.
MARY BOONE: you have a bunch of them, don't you? albert milo walks in from another room.
ALBERT MILO: hey jean! it'll never fit.
MARY BOONE: it'll be ok.
ALBERT MILO: you better take a look. why's your door so small? the ceilings are sixteen feet and your door's the size of a mouse hole!

ALBERT MILO: you doing anything right now? 
BASQUIAT: naa..
ALBERT MILO: let's get out of here.
BASQUIAT: see ya in an hour. so what do you think?
MARY BOONE: bruno spoke to me already. we could talk about it.
BASQUIAT: i'm here.
MARY BOONE: ok. i'll be at your studio thursday three o'clock.

ALBERT MILO: this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan. i painted it after joseph beuys died. a rebirth painting. i felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. the chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.. 
BASQUIAT: do you ever get sick of it?
ALBERT MILO: of what?
BASQUIAT: the whole thing - painting.
ALBERT MILO: no. it's one of the few times i feel good. i used to have to go to work and cook every
ALBERT MILO: day. that i got sick of.
BASQUIAT: what about the they write?
ALBERT MILO: you're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. i read that. the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. that's your enemy, not your audience. your audience hasn't even been born yet. it's a lie that art is popular. the only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. i'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. there're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and andy's one of them.
BASQUIAT: i haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
ALBERT MILO: as long as i've known andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. he's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in knows how many places together. but he doesn't care about me. he cares about you. you're the only person he cares about. he's your friend. that article. you want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?

ALBERT MILO: alright. i'll be right up. albert leaves. jean looks at some paintings. 
STELLA: hi.
BASQUIAT: hi.
STELLA: i've seen you before. i like your paintings a lot. your hair was different.

STELLA: some of them. 
BASQUIAT: stand still.
BASQUIAT: see you later.
STELLA: thanks
ALBERT MILO: where's jean?
STELLA: he just left.

BASQUIAT: what do you mean? 
BRUNO: you haven't heard? andy's dead. the light changes.

BASQUIAT: hello? gina? 
MALE VOICE: who is it?

BASQUIAT: hey, come here! please. just for a second. open the door. the janitor gets nervous. he leaves. 
BASQUIAT: open up! open up!
BASQUIAT: my mother's inside.
GUARD: come back tomorrow. visiting hours are over. don't cause any trouble.
BASQUIAT: i'm not here to visit... i wanna take her home.
GUARD: don't cause any trouble.

BASQUIAT: willie mays... nice to see you. benny looks at jean's eyes. 
BASQUIAT: how's gina? you guys getting along?
BENNY: she's good.
BASQUIAT: i guess it was a long time ago.
BENNY: come on, let's get out of here.

BENNY: drugs??! 
BASQUIAT: medicine, man! like health food. i'm taking care of my health!

CLERK: you starting a hospital? 
BASQUIAT: just ring it up. i don't need a bag. try this tabouli - it's great...

BASQUIAT: it's definitely time to get out of here. 
BASQUIAT: hawaii? hawaii. let's go to ireland. we'll stop in every bar and have a drink.
