RUDY: ain't there yet.
NICK: three days, man.
RUDY: not yet.

"and all that gets me through the day is to close my eyes and imagine holding you, and kissing you, and touching you, and tasting you everywhere because i know at that moment, i'll feel i've found the reason for my whole entire life." rudy still stares at the stone ceiling. 
RUDY: for twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
NICK: yeah. you grow up in detroit, you get matured real quick.
NICK: sure as don't make me miss millie bobek. guess i owe millie, though. if i hadn't been rollin, her, i woulda never ended up here. and i woulda never met ashley. that's the world for ya.

NICK: me and her got a connection. read this part. read the part about stuffing her stocking.
RUDY: she's using a new perfume.
NICK: no, i think that's just oranges. she writes here she's eating oranges.
RUDY: oh.
NICK: shoulda written to that magazine, rudy. i'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. you? you're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.

RUDY: it wasn't me, alamo --
THE ALAMO: that's when.
NICK: two days.

NICK: so maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to motor city for new year's. she says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? i'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work. 
RUDY: what, working security?
NICK: no, i'm through with that ashley's right. gotta start doing something i got a stake in. get a business going.
RUDY: i don't know, i've seen the business world.
NICK: hotwiring cars, rudy, does not qualify as a small business. chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
NICK: ashley's talking about maybe we can start something up together...
NICK: whatsa matter, zook?
RUDY: the you doing, zookerman?

RUDY: he was burning for you too...

RUDY: don't do it, rudy... 
RUDY: don't do it ...

RUDY: you ashley? 
RUDY: i'm nick.

RUDY: i like your coat. 
RUDY: this -- this is just something they gave me at the door. wasn't snowing when we signed up, y'know?
RUDY: how's your coffee?
ASHLEY: good.
RUDY: gotta be ten degrees out there.
ASHLEY: radio said negative five.
RUDY: negative five?
ASHLEY: yeah.
RUDY: i don't think it's negative five.
ASHLEY: radio said.
RUDY: wind chill. that's probably what they meant.
RUDY: i was scared. scared you were gonna take one look at me and change your mind. scared i was walking into heartache. all those words... you put a picture in your mind of where they come from and when you see where maybe it's not the same as your picture.
ASHLEY: i figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
RUDY: no, no --
ASHLEY: saw my outfit or something, my coat --
RUDY: no, hey, i like your coat --
ASHLEY: saw me --
RUDY: ashley, no. that was me, that's what i was scared of. i mean, be serious... i ain't exactly looking like mr. universe here.
ASHLEY: you are to me.
ASHLEY: thought you wrote you had a mustache.
RUDY: i can get another one going. y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
ASHLEY: no, no, no. be like you want to be.
RUDY: do that again.
ASHLEY: what.
RUDY: smile.
ASHLEY: no --
RUDY: one more. smile. one more.
ASHLEY: no, c'mon --
RUDY: i've been dreaming about that smile, ashley mercer. for a long time.
ASHLEY: you're better than the picture in my mind, nick... you're real.

RUDY: tell me something. this the first time you've ever done this? 
ASHLEY: go to hell, nick mason, what's that supposed to mean --
RUDY: no, not that, no... i mean this, the whole thing. start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. get a boyfriend like this. tell me the truth.
ASHLEY: well. you're not the first guy i wrote to. but you're the only one i kept writing to.
RUDY: yeah. me too. why? i mean i know why for me, why i paid for the ad. but you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
ASHLEY: i told you, nick. remember?
RUDY: tell me again.
ASHLEY: all the guys i've ever been with... they never want to know me. who i am on the inside. they just want to qet inside. when they do, they think that means they know who i am. that i trust them. that they know me. that there's nothing left to learn. a guy like you, nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. i figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
RUDY: had some bad relationships, didn't you.
ASHLEY: not bad. just regular. you wrote me wonderful things, nick. personal things.
RUDY: well, wasn't all me, y'know.
ASHLEY: yes it was all you --
RUDY: guy i was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
ASHLEY: i'm talking about the heart, nick. i'm not talking about the words.
RUDY: y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
ASHLEY: then he shoulda signed his name.
ASHLEY: and he'd be here right now.

RUDY: where the are you going? 
ASHLEY: provisions! we are not leaving that motel room again till after new year's: we need ten days worth of provisions! what's good?!

ASHLEY: yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby. so don't talk to me about little white lies.

ASHLEY: you need a coat! 
RUDY: ash, you've gotten me enough --

RUDY: i'll see what i can do.

ASHLEY: just tell him what you know, nick! that's all they want! and we'll get out of this!
ASHLEY: he found them... i swear, nick... ...he found them...

GABRIEL: "my sweet, ashy-lashy, i have been dreaming of you constantly, and knowing you are out there makes these walls not seem so close or so strong or so cold..." women live for this stuff. dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming 'bout your those, gettin' x-rated on me here, nicky... where are we... oh, right, other side... "someday i'm gonna take you up by lake s. before i went in, before millie, 'fore i had my situation, i used to work up at this casino, working security. used to watch for people stealing chips, counting cards, getting piss-drunk, that kinda indian place, they hired this reject outta vegas to run it, got about as much business sense as a buffalo patty. anyways, it's a fun place to run some numbers and play." gabriel puts the letter down. 
GABRIEL: you're a good writer, nick. i give this writing an a-plus.
RUDY: i never worked at no casino.
ASHLEY: nick...
RUDY: that's the guy i was in with, i did my last ten months with him. he rode a two-year bit for manslaughter -- split a guy's skull open at a bar for harassing his girl. that's nick mason. he worked at that casino. he's the one who wrote her letters. me, i'm a mechanic, my last job was a quickie lube, i did five for lifting cars. i don't know about blackjack, i don't know about indians. i'm not him.
GABRIEL: bury this guy.
ASHLEY: gabriel, you promised!
GABRIEL: i promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! when he helped us! loverboy don't want to play!
ASHLEY: you promised me!
GABRIEL: and you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
GABRIEL: he'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway. bury him all over the place.

JUMPY: the problem with prison... is that it is founded on the fundamentally flawed perception of rehabilitation through punishment. a society can't hope to create a "changed man" by surrounding him with the worst in his fellow man; what it "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction that if he can survive the inhumanity of prison, what then, can he not withstand? he has seen man's darkest soul and kept his sight: what is left for such a man? what faith? what fear? 
JUMPY: don't get no blood on my boots --

RUDY: about the tomahawk! what the do you want to know! 
RUDY: i spend six months writing poetry and my pen pal me over. thanks for the stamps, ash. you want me, you got me. whaddya want to know.
GABRIEL: everything.
ASHLEY: i love you... nick, i love you...
GABRIEL: hey. she says she loves you, nick.
RUDY: she says a lot of things.
GABRIEL: she's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. you just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. my sister loves you, and i ain't gonna have you break her heart.
RUDY: wish i had a brother like you.
GABRIEL: a girl says she loves you, you say something.
RUDY: i had better in prison.
GABRIEL: heyyy. be nice, convict. we're gonna be working together here. get him back in the rig.
PUG: he's not the guy, monster.
PUG: whole time you were driving, he was telling her he's not the guy, he's not the guy. i know why he'd tell us he's not the guy. why's he telling her he's not the guy? what if he's not the guy?
GABRIEL: the man who wrote those letters loved ashley, boys. he lived for her love. let's see him live for love.
GABRIEL: where's she work?
RUDY: what?
GABRIEL: wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? where's she work?
RUDY: j.c. penney. beauty and fragrances.
GABRIEL: what's her middle name?
RUDY: samantha.
GABRIEL: what'd they call her in high school?
RUDY: bam bam.
GABRIEL: what'd they call her in college?
RUDY: what college.
GABRIEL: where'd she drop her cherry?
ASHLEY: gabriel!
RUDY: canada.
GABRIEL: be more specific.
RUDY: a station wagon in canada.
GABRIEL: what's her greatest fear?
RUDY: her brother.
GABRIEL: wrong, nick. it's drowning.
RUDY: no. it's her brother.
GABRIEL: that's love.
GABRIEL: let's get back on the road. it's time to start talking, nick. time to start telling tales --
RUDY: nick don't talk till nick gets something.
RUDY: hot. chocolate. the trucker slowly smiles. his crew chuckles.
MERLIN: you want that for here or to go?
RUDY: i been in iron mountain for two years, truck driver. i do one more crime, i'm back there for good, so you and your sister and your trucker friends. you want to hear about some job of mine? i want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
RUDY: and some pecan-fucking-pie.

GABRIEL: so when you worked there -- 
GABRIEL: you knew the place --
RUDY: hey.
RUDY: y'know, i could really go for some onion rings.
ASHLEY: gabriel! you said talk to him. that's all you ever said...
GABRIEL: we're talking, aren't we?
GABRIEL: how much money's in that casino? day-to-day.
RUDY: i don't know.
GABRIEL: the you don't.
RUDY: five million?
GABRIEL: you wrote ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working christmas eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. and the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. that a true story now?
RUDY: christmas... eve...
GABRIEL: you know where the guards are. you know how to get in and out. you know where the money is. we're taking down that casino, convict. you're the guy gonna tell us how.
RUDY: hey, it's... been two years --
GABRIEL: we got faith in you, nick mason. you're our inside man.

RUDY: ...goddamn it, rudy... it... girl, nick... you're so smart, so smart... 
RUDY: where's your christmas dinner now...

JUMPY: i've read where the retail industry does fifty percent of its business between december 1st and december 25th. half the year's business, in one month's time. it seems to me an intelligent society would legislate a second such gift-giving holiday, create, say, a christmas two -- late may, early june -- to further stimulate growth and prosperity. for who would protest such a holiday? taking the fifty percent model, a christmas two would grow this country's annual per capita income by close to one-third. 
GABRIEL: christmas two.
GABRIEL: ever since you started night school, you been givin, me headaches, jumpy. headaches. go see what's taking him.

GABRIEL: here ya go, convict. we cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. what you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it. 
MERLIN: and where they hide the real money.
GABRIEL: and nick? if you even think about setting us up, giving us some bad information? we go down... you go down... now. christmas eve. how many guards are there gonna be?
RUDY: hell. ten?
GABRIEL: and which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
MERLIN: start talking, nick.
PUG: start talkin
RUDY: who the made this map.
GABRIEL: what?
RUDY: i said, who the made the map?
GABRIEL: i did.
RUDY: this isn't the tomahawk.
GABRIEL: what the are you talking about.
RUDY: this is the front entrance, right? you get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. blackjack's here to here -- lined up. what's this, the cage? cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
PUG: that's what it looks like!
RUDY: since when? what the is this room?
MERLIN: buffet. whaddya think it is?
RUDY: buffet is by the bar! what the kind of map is this?!
GABRIEL: we walked the place for a week.
RUDY: and i worked there. for a year.
PUG: map is kinda dirty, monster...
RUDY: they changed the layout.
GABRIEL: what?
RUDY: they changed the layout -- whadda they call you? mr. monster? they remodeled the place. when i worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
ASHLEY: jack. jack bangs.
RUDY: right, jack bangs. uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. maybe get a better crowd. musta gone and done it while i was in the mountain. i don't know this map, man. how the am i supposed to tell you what door goes where?
GABRIEL: they wouldn't have changed the security setup.
RUDY: when i worked there, this was bangs, office. back here. he kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the indians. called it the... uh... ...the powwow safe.
JUMPY: the powwow safe?
RUDY: his personal safe, he gave it a name. now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? then who knows what else they changed.
GABRIEL: so what the good are you...
RUDY: you'd have to get me inside. get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. then i could work with your map.
GABRIEL: wrong, convict. you walk in there, they recognize you.
PUG: so what?
GABRIEL: they recognize him, they'll remember him after the job goes down.
RUDY: they won't recognize me.
GABRIEL: why not.
RUDY: trust me. they won't recognize me.
GABRIEL: we'll trust you when we're rich. why not.
RUDY: 'cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
RUDY: i give you the wrong information, you're gonna shoot me. well, i don't know your map. so you can either find a way to get me in there... or you can shoot me right now.

RIB. PERFORMING TONIGHT: DAKOTA!": the truck motors on by. gabriel nods to rudy: 
GABRIEL: bring back some memories, nick?
RUDY: more than you know.

RUDY: what the is this? what happened to working together? 
GABRIEL: rather be back in the mountain?
RUDY: might as well be.
GABRIEL: don't have weather channel in the mountain, nick.
GABRIEL: sleep good, loverboy. tomorrow you got singing for your supper to do.
RUDY: get your own room.
ASHLEY: he said he wanted to talk to you. when he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, i wanna talk to him." i thought he meant back in detroit. i thought he meant --
RUDY: but you knew why. knew why, didn't ya.
ASHLEY: i thought we'd have a few more days.
RUDY: for what? you to talk me into "helping"? what, he promise you a share of the winnings?
ASHLEY: no!
RUDY: well, judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
ASHLEY: nick! he wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! that's all he wants! i hate him, nick... you know how...
RUDY: so get him outta your life. get out of michigan. they got perfume counters in chicago, don't they?
ASHLEY: not without you.
RUDY: since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?

RUDY: and i'm his ticket. what's the last place they took down?
ASHLEY: what?
RUDY: gabriel and his guys. what's the last place they robbed?
ASHLEY: i don't think they've ever robbed anything before. i think they've just driven guns.
RUDY: they've never done a robbery?
ASHLEY: they're truck drivers.
RUDY: then they do need me, don't they. they really need me...
ASHLEY: we're gonna get out of here, nick. we're gonna get out of this...
RUDY: we? what "we"...

ASHLEY: if i'd told you what he wanted, you'd have been gone. you'd have gotten on that bus and stayed on it. and if that's selfish, i am. if that's lying, i'm a liar. but i been dealing with fucked-up brother and his fucked-up friends for a long time, and i was stronger than him then and i'm stronger than him now. 'cause he showed up for money. i showed up for love. and if you're so ready to make me your enemy... then what did you show up for, nick. what did you really want... with me... with a fiery look, she strides from the room.

GABRIEL: take a look what pug's bought for ya.
RUDY: a cowboy. you're going to send me into an indian casino disguised as a cowboy. have you thought this entirely through?
GABRIEL: put it on.
GABRIEL: you're a country-western singer up from nashville for the the holidays. visiting your grandma on the lake, driving into the tomahawk for some scotch and slots. you only play the slots, you got that? don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
RUDY: what kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
GABRIEL: you do.
RUDY: at least gimme video poker.
GABRIEL: shut the up. you play what your girlfriend plays. ashley's going in with you. you talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. you walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, i want to know the run of the place.
RUDY: do i get a country-western name?
GABRIEL: you get recognized, convict, you get a country-western funeral.

RUDY: y'know what, guys? i woke up this morning, i got a really lucky feeling going on. i mean it, i'm feeling that good. i wouldn't be surprised if i walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. hell, we wouldn't even have to --

ASHLEY: get your hands off me -- 
GABRIEL: you got one hour.
RUDY: i'm gonna need some money.
RUDY: ten dollars? what do i do with ten dollars?
GABRIEL: don't tip.
RUDY: monster. if we're working together here, we gotta be working together. i can't walk in there looking like the lone ranger with ten bucks to throw down. you don't want me getting noticed, right? not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
GABRIEL: don't. lose.
RUDY: you ready to gamble, darlin'?
RUDY: y'all take care of my guitar.
MERLIN: who's robbin' who here, gabriel...
GABRIEL: get in there and watch 'em. watch their every move.

JACK BANGS: there's an s-word i'd really like to throw in the discussion here, guys, cause it's a big part of what's going on. big element, 'kay? s-word. it's a serious issue, serious factor, so i'm just gonna get it out there, throw it an out there, so we can know it, we can talk about it, we can get things done... snow. are you with me, guys? snow. big time, fucking, grade-a, god- quality, s-n-o-w-snow.

YOUNG GOVERNOR: we understand you, mr. bangs.
JACK BANGS: capades? they don't do it. mittens? outlawed. why?
YOUNG GOVERNOR: we're aware of your position.
JACK BANGS: because down there this is money. up here this is heat. you wanted vegas quality, i brought it to you. you wanted vegas press, i gave it to you. but guys, please, guys... i can't get you vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
OLD GOVERNOR: we understand the paiutes' casino saw a net profit of twelve million dollars last year.
JACK BANGS: the paiutes, they cook their books.
OLD GOVERNOR: the waitela reservation made seventeen million.
JACK BANGS: seventeen?
OLD GOVERNOR: perhaps you have researched this, mr. bangs. is the snowfall on our side of the lake that much greater than the snowfall on theirs?
JACK BANGS: i'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three russian girls, they look like meryl streep, they can juggle anything.
YOUNG GOVERNOR: mr. bangs.
JACK BANGS: guys. we're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? nobody does that in michigan. nobody.
YOUNG GOVERNOR: the tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
JACK BANGS: i'm putting liquor in the drinks, i'm giving 10-times odds on craps, i got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! show me another buffet's gonna offer you coke and pepsi! whaddya want me to do?!
YOUNG GOVERNOR: we want to see our casino making money again, mr. bangs. making money for our community.
OLD GOVERNOR: like the paiutes and the waitela.
YOUNG GOVERNOR: we want you doing the job... that we brought you here to do.

ASHLEY: so does it look a lot different? 
RUDY: here and there. restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. tables've been moved around; the big man's office, i dunno, might be upstairs now.
ASHLEY: that guy knows you?
RUDY: yeah, uh. mike. that's mike.
RUDY: you start spending your brother's money. i'm gonna take a circuit around the joint, check for any new ins and outs. i'll snag us some drinks.

INDIAN BARTENDER: you want that rum and coke or rum and pepsi?

JACK BANGS: i can't go back to vegas, bear. they'll kill me, 'kay? i can't go back... 
BARTENDER: what does the tribe want?
JACK BANGS: they want gold-paved roads is what they want. talking 'bout the paiutes. paiutes are on the interstate. nothing i can do about that, man, i didn't pick the spot for your reservation.
BARTENDER: neither did we.
JACK BANGS: yeah, yeah, whatever.
JACK BANGS: hey. hey, cowboy. jack bangs, i run the place. nice to have you in the tomahawk. tell me something...

GABRIEL: what'd you tell that casino manager?
RUDY: nnn... nothing...
GABRIEL: you were talking to him! what'd you tell him!?
RUDY: nothing... i promise-nothing...

RUDY: he thought i was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me! 
GABRIEL: i been driving rigs a long time, nick. four, five million miles of road. worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day. tell 'em i needed sleep, i needed rest, they'll hire someone else...
GABRIEL: ...dispatcher's screaming for me to haul ass, he's got a load on the runback for me. shipper's making me wait for the pickup, receiver's 'bout the count...
GABRIEL: ...got the cops at the bottom of every mountain, got the dot at the top. and every day, every day, i see all those faces in their little airbag hot wheels, moms and pops and jam- faced kiddies, giving me that look to go to and get off their happy highway. hey. they don't gotta get two thousand miles by sundown, or the gang don't eat come sunrise.
GABRIEL: it's time for me... to be working for me. i want mine, nick. and i need you. did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
RUDY: no, gabriel... no...
RUDY: ...he... he asked me... how i'd heard about his place... he didn't know it was me...

RUDY: man, monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me... 
GABRIEL: nick. i been trying to hit you.
GABRIEL: maybe that'll help sharpen your memory.
GABRIEL: tonight we're gonna take another look at that map. and this time you're gonna tell me what i need to know.

ASHLEY: nick! nick -- 
MERLIN: pug.

ASHLEY: nick, oh my what'd he do to you? what'd he do? 
RUDY: he had some points to make...
ASHLEY: christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
ASHLEY: we'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
RUDY: ...haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
ASHLEY: shh, now. rest now. two years, nick. you haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
ASHLEY: you saved my life. you could have run, but you didn't. you saved me.
RUDY: you saved me.
ASHLEY: i saved you because i love you, nick. why'd you save me?
RUDY: guy i was in with... car thief... i used to read your letters to him. i know they were private... i know, but... you spend twenty-four hours a day with somebody, you gotta talk, y'know? you gotta share. or the room gets even smaller. and sometimes, i'd be reading them, and he'd close his eyes, get a smile on his face... and i'd know somewhere inside he was pretending you were writing to him -- he'd see your face, your pictures on the wall... some nights i think he fell in love with you, too.
RUDY: you gave a couple guys hope, ashley. and with hope, there ain't nothing you can't survive.
ASHLEY: i'm sorry, nick... i'm so sorry...
RUDY: don't say my name...
ASHLEY: i love you, nick...
RUDY: ash. don't say it. don't say my name.
ASHLEY: i love you...

RUDY: they'll have guns. 
ASHLEY: what?
RUDY: you said they've run guns, in their trucks. so they'll have guns. to do this robbery. they'll have serious guns.
ASHLEY: i don't know...
RUDY: we'll need one.
RUDY: i'm going to have to be inside that casino. when it happens. i'll need to be part of it. i can't just be drawing some map.
ASHLEY: nick, what are you talking about?
RUDY: we need to find a way to make me part of it.
ASHLEY: part of... with them?
RUDY: if we're helping them with their robbery, we're gonna be doing more than just walking away. like that's some christmas bonus.
RUDY: you want him outta your life? you want a real new year to look forward to? if we're gonna do this... we're gonna do it to get it all.

PUG: knew a guy in joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. his lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray. 
MERLIN: that right? i used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. you ever see a with a silicon tongue?
PUG: hell. the guy from joliet, those black-ass lungs were the least of his problems. got so much smoke in him his lungs couldn't even hold it. got into his system, man. into his blood. coming out his ears, man, coming out his eyes. guy'd be walking the row, smoke'd be puffing out his skin.
MERLIN: this trucker? met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. he's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. his tongue. it right down.
PUG: my guy would walk into a room, set off the sprinklers.
MERLIN: his lips went next. you ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
MERLIN: vegetarians...
GABRIEL: start singing.
RUDY: i have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
GABRIEL: sing it in pictures, nick.
RUDY: what you gotta worry about first is the guards. place doesn't look much richer than when i worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. there'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. eyes in the sky. they see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're
MERLIN: how do we take them out?
RUDY: you gotta get someone upstairs.
MERLIN: how do we do that?
RUDY: across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. keypad access.
GABRIEL: what's the code?
RUDY: uh... they change it every month. i wouldn't know. if there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. you gotta draw 'em out.
PUG: without having them hit the alarms.
RUDY: i got an idea on that one. once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. there's a security camera room that videotapes everything. you've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
MERLIN: what about the money?
RUDY: you lock down security, you move behind the cage. you hit the count room. there'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. cashiers'll know it. they'll have alarms.
JUMPY: what about the powwow safe?
RUDY: what?
JUMPY: the powwow safe. the secret safe. you said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
RUDY: oh. right. yeah. that's, uh upstairs. uh. here. powwow safe.
RUDY: so. you're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. you're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front. you need six.
GABRIEL: we got five. putting ashley outside.
RUDY: you need six.

RUDY: you go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. someone hits an alarm, you're someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're you need six. six is me. 
GABRIEL: no.
RUDY: you guys get caught, i go away for good. i got an interest in making sure you don't. you need a sixth man covering an exit. what're you gonna do about it.
ASHLEY: yeah. what're you gonna do about it.
GABRIEL: i want a map of that security level. every room, every guard, every thing.
RUDY: six men means six guns.
GABRIEL: no way.
RUDY: i'm no threat without a gun.
GABRIEL: no, you're not.
RUDY: there'll be people in that casino. i can't keep them from leaving if i don't get a gun. i don't need bullets, monster... but i gotta be a threat.
ASHLEY: what's the matter, gabriel? this is what you wanted him for, isn't it?
GABRIEL: no gun.
RUDY: well. what you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
GABRIEL: that part, nick... was planned out the day i read your letters.
RUDY: what. we all gonna dress up like cowboys?
GABRIEL: not cowboys, nick. not cowboys.
GABRIEL: not on christmas eve.

RUDY: you gotta be kidding me. 
GABRIEL: 'tis the season, convict.
GABRIEL: can't be attracting attention, right?
RUDY: what, we walking in there and delivering toys?
MERLIN: yeah.

ASHLEY: he wants to see your map. 
RUDY: i'm almost done.
ASHLEY: he says he wants it now.
RUDY: if he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. i'm working on it here.
ASHLEY: how are we gonna do this, nick?
RUDY: you're the getaway girl. the money's gonna get to you eventually. gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. but i can't do that without a gun. any luck talking to him?
ASHLEY: bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
RUDY: is there any way you could get into his truck?
ASHLEY: no.
RUDY: we need a gun, ash. we need a gun...
RUDY: here's the picasso. is he in his room?
ASHLEY: they all are. football's on.
RUDY: keep 'em there for a little while.
RUDY: we're gonna get you out of detroit, ash. get you out of beauty and fragrances. remember that. after all this is over, when you know me, when you really know me... remember it was me.

ASHLEY: ...and he's saying "we're not gonna help him just to walk away. if we're gonna help him... we're gonna get it all... 
ASHLEY: ...he wants to help now, he wants to rob it now we could probably stay right here, he'd go on and rob it by himself --
GABRIEL: he wants the money.
ASHLEY: no, baby. he wants me.
ASHLEY: he wants... your "sister"...
GABRIEL: ...whoever she is.
ASHLEY: nick mason's gonna help us more than we ever dreamed.

GABRIEL: all those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters... 
ASHLEY: to all those cons...
GABRIEL: searching for a money man...
ASHLEY: we musta written what, twenty of 'em? and they were before this guy. one, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in leavenworth --
GABRIEL: -- till he his parole --
ASHLEY: -- plus the forty to mason... how many letters is that?
GABRIEL: that's a book, baby. that's a book of love.
GABRIEL: i can't take watching you touch him. i can't take his hands on you.
ASHLEY: one more day, baby. one more day to christmas.
GABRIEL: i've been doing good, though.
ASHLEY: didn't have to hit me so hard. didn't have to throw me outta the truck.
GABRIEL: didn't have to send me down a mountain.
ASHLEY: what, he should see me help you catch him?
ASHLEY: he's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. he wants a gun, give him a gun. take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. the more manpower we've got in there, the better. he won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
GABRIEL: he'll be dead when he does.

GABRIEL: y'know something, baby? if you were my sister? i'd still want to wake up christmas morning with you... 
ASHLEY: mmm, baby. and i'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...

MERLIN: where the hell's gabriel? 
JUMPY: with his girlfriend. making up for "nick" time. i'm going down to the bar, you want something?

RUDY: i don't know where you're going. but i'm going home.
ASHLEY: we go together, nick. wherever... we go together. remember?

JACK BANGS: and all through the house... not a creature was stirring... why don't you go ahead and send most of your guys home, ed. 
SECURITY BOSS: thanks, jack. merry x-mas.
JACK BANGS: hell. nobody even comes here to cheat...

RUDY: hey jumpy, i want to ask you something. you have any problem with the fact that we're on our way to take millions of dollars from an indian casino? 
JUMPY: nick. it's true that indian gaming's gone a long way toward restoring wealth and pride to communities who've been economically isolated and enslaved for centuries. stronger infrastructure, better schools, higher employment... they're all the results of reservation casino success stories. still, many natives believe that these are temples to a godless materialism and greed that will only infect the souls of indigenous peoples until their love of money has destroyed the spiritual values their ancestors died to protect and their homelands have become no different from any united states suburb, satellite city or industrial park. destroying the indian legacy once and for all and leaving behind a nation of selfish, angry natives, of which i, it's true, am one -- -- as they hit the tomahawk's doors --

RUDY: hey-hey, egg nog for everybody!

RUDY: hey! hey! there is a powwow safe!

MERLIN: hell. i'm gonna take pleasure in this... 
RUDY: me too.

RUDY: i'm sorry. 
JACK BANGS: that's why they call it gambling.

GABRIEL: you almost got away with it, santa. got outta the tomahawk, got to your car, got halfway to canada till you caught some ice in the road. by the time you hit bottom down there, whole car was burning like a comet. musta burned up all that money too. 
GABRIEL: buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. started shooting. they won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. four dead santas and some burned-up cash. merry christmas, the end.
RUDY: was it your plan, monster? or was it hers.
GABRIEL: she told me 'bout the convict magazines. had to figure there'd be some boys in the pen with some useful knowledge. with nobody to talk to. nobody to listen. so we stocked up on stationery.
GABRIEL: hard life being a trucker's girl.
RUDY: i saved your life.
ASHLEY: you shouldn't have.
RUDY: he did love you, you know. nick. he did love you.
ASHLEY: who wouldn't.
RUDY: maybe this is where you wanted him, ashley. at the bottom of a ravine, dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. maybe. but it didn't happen. 'cause what you did for him was make him the happiest held ever been. you showed him hope and taught him mercy. and he died a peaceful man. you wanted to destroy some convict... and all you did was save his soul. remember that. love your money and remember that.
ASHLEY: merry christmas, rudy.
RUDY: i'm glad it was me.
ASHLEY: merry christmas.
GABRIEL: get in the car.
GABRIEL: get in the car!
RUDY: how'd you know my name...
ASHLEY: what?
RUDY: rudy. how'd you know my name?
ASHLEY: what are you talking about?
RUDY: you said merry christmas, rudy.
ASHLEY: i... you told me your name was rudy. you told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't nick --
RUDY: no --
ASHLEY: you were screaming you weren't nick! and we just didn't believe you!
RUDY: but i never said rudy.
ASHLEY: you said it a million times!
RUDY: i never told you my name.
GABRIEL: ash?
RUDY: how'd you know my name was rudy.
GABRIEL: ash?
RUDY: how'd you know my name.
ASHLEY: men.
RUDY: where is he. a silence. no one moves.
NICK: merry christmas, rudy.
NICK: i missed you, beautiful.
ASHLEY: i missed you too, nicky baby.
ASHLEY: for your information. i never the wrong guy.
NICK: oh, hey. have you two been properly introduced? sweetness, this is rudy duncan, i did almost a year with him in the mountain. read him all your letters, talked about you all the time, made him feel like he really knew you. my friend... wantcha to meet millie bobek. 'member millie bobek, dontcha? my girlfriend fore i went in? worked at that bar in motor city, where i manslaughtered that guy? hell. didn't talk about her much once the ashley letters started coming, i guess.
NICK: millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. i was in the mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
RUDY: she set them up. all of them.
NICK: why not have her pretend to find me? pretend to write me and reel me in? tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named ashley?
RUDY: and you set me up.
NICK: always wanted to rob that casino, rudy. way back when i worked there. what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
NICK: paid the alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. he's a lifer, what does he care. paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story i was dead. once the wound healed up... got out of the mountain this morning. and tonight i'm a rich man.
RUDY: how'd you know i'd do it.
NICK: do what?
RUDY: walk outta there and tell her i was you.
NICK: because every time i read her letters, rudy... you listened. keep your gun on him.
NICK: five santas walked into that tomahawk, rudy. that's what the witnesses'll say. so we gotta have five santas not walk out. gotta have five... this'll burn right away... in the fire...
NICK: hell, you never needed to convince ashley you were me. just the truckers. i figured i'd talked enough about the tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
RUDY: talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot i'd remember
NICK: hm. well. they'd have killed you if you weren't me, rudy. we knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
NICK: they had the weapons and the willpower. we just gave them their inside man.
RUDY: you gave them me.
NICK: i gave them me.
NICK: sweetness! let's light up the tree!

NICK: ...rudy... help me... rudy... 
NICK: ...rudy! rudy! help me!!!

MOTHER: rudy...? rudy? 
FATHER: son? is... is that you...?
