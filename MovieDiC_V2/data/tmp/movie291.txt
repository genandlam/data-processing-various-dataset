JULIE: bless me, father, for i have sinned. it's been a year since my last confession... 
PRIEST: yes?
JULIE: i killed a man. well, i thought i had...then...
PRIEST: go on...
JULIE: i have these dreams...horrible dreams. and this man is always there with me.
PRIEST: i know...
JULIE: you see, he was a killer. he murdered helen and barry, and he would have killed me too, if i hadn't...gotten away with it. i don't know, i guess i just need to deal with the fear, the guilt...to finally say his name. ben willis. his name was ben willis...
PRIEST: i know...
JULIE: you know? but how could you...

PROFESSOR: nice to see you find political science so stimulating -- the lecture hall erupts with laughter. 
JULIE: i'm sorry -- julie grabs her stuff and bolts.

WILL: julie! wait! you okay? 
JULIE: i'm fine.
WILL: you sure?
JULIE: i'm fine.
WILL: you don't seem fine.
JULIE: i had another dream, will.
WILL: the shower again?
JULIE: it was in a church...it was so real.
WILL: i'm sorry.
JULIE: i thought i was over the dreams for good. i really did. i hadn't had one for months.
WILL: it just takes time, julie. it's gonna get better.
JULIE: it can't get worse. i mean, it's not like this was the first time i freaked out in class. i hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, i'm this close from being thrown out of school.
JULIE: it was one year ago...
WILL: it's...the anniversary. that's what's going on...take it easy on yourself.
JULIE: i'm trying. i really am...sometimes i don't even know why i came up here in the first place.
WILL: to get out of southport?
JULIE: right. now i remember.
WILL: nah. i'll probably just be here studying for finals. the joys of summer school... are you okay?
JULIE: i'm okay.
WILL: are you sure?
JULIE: thanks for the talk, will. you're good to me.
WILL: um...okay. bye.

JULIE: oh, my ray. you scared me. 
RAY: i got in early. i was excited... who was that guy?
JULIE: oh, that's will. he's a friend.
RAY: yeah.
JULIE: ray, we're just friend.
RAY: every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
JULIE: why are you being like this?
RAY: hey, i'm sorry. you're right. are you ready to go? i've got the old truck. you know the drill...crab boil at ollie's. croaker queen pageant...it's only small-town fun, but it's still nice. people really miss you. i miss you.
JULIE: ray, i can't...
RAY: can't what?
JULIE: i just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. like some critical piece is missing. please understand...
RAY: i understand something.
JULIE: it's not like that. it's not you. it's me. my head. i want to go back. i want to be with you. i want to be fine. i want everything to be like it used to be. it just isn't. ray is hurt and confused. julie hey, why don't you stay up here? they have fireworks over the river.
RAY: i have to work, julie. my boat's in southport, remember? but, i get it. you need your space from craokerland. and maybe from me, too. ray starts walking away. ray you know where to find me.
JULIE: ray? ray? at least come up for a while.
RAY: it's okay. i'm just gonna go.
JULIE: ray, i'm sorry. i didn't mean... i'm just scared...that's all.

KARLA: i thought you were out of town! 
JULIE: what are you doing in my closet?
KARLA: i thought you were out of town!
JULIE: what are you doing in my closet?
KARLA: i just wanted your black pants, but i'm not ready to die for them!
JULIE: that was heart attack time, karla.
KARLA: no. when i put these skinny pants on my body...now, that's heart attack time.
JULIE: i'm not going anywhere. i'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
KARLA: yeah, right -- whatever.
JULIE: i think i just really hurt ray's feelings.
KARLA: listen to me, julie. ray's a great guy, nothing against old ray, but he's so...ray. i mean, he lives in southport. will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
JULIE: there's nothing between will and me.
KARLA: yet. nothing yet.
JULIE: no i'm not.
KARLA: fine, then be fat, ugly, and depressed.

TYRELL: you know what i want to do to you ...right now, don't you? there's gotta be somewhere we can be alone. 
KARLA: i don't think so. it's pretty crowded.
TYRELL: just for a minute, baby. i got something i wanna tell you.
KARLA: if you can say all you gotta say in a minute then i don't wanna hear it.
TYRELL: i'll talk real slow. he's kissing her ear. she starts to giggle. the bartender sets down drinks on karla's tray.
KARLA: ask her to dance. tyrell hesitates. karla go on.
TYRELL: you're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, jules.
JULIE: tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
TYRELL: that's right. it's how the species survives. you'll never convince me otherwise. wanna dance?
KARLA: say yes.
JULIE: no.
KARLA: no means yes.
JULIE: tyrell, i appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? we make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
TYRELL: worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
KARLA: come on, i'll take a break and we'll all dance.

JULIE: karla! did you tell him i'd be here? 
KARLA: nope. i told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. and then he came anyway.
WILL: this was not my idea.
JULIE: what?
WILL: i said, this...do you want a drink?
TYRELL: where i come from, you want to the goodies, you got to at least talk to them first.
WILL: how about a drink?

JULIE: ben... 
SLICKER GUY: hye, baby. you following me up here? well, all right.

JULIE: that could break the machine. 
KARLA: julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. it's a fact. the phone rings. karla looks at her watch. karla it's tyrell.
JULIE: the number's unlisted...
KARLA: would you relax? we've been dating three months. he ain't stalking your

JULIE: ray, karla won a trip to the bahamas! an island called tower bay. and she wants us to come with her.

JULIE: we'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... you know...
RAY: this weekend?
RAY: you'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
DAVE: 
JULIE: it's not you, it's southport. and it's the bahamas! and it's free!
KARLA: you gotta sell his on the bahamas?
JULIE: ray, come on. i want us to be together.

DAVE: no way, man. surprise her. she'll be psyched.

DAVE: man, i love am radio. you got right-wing conspiracy, tips for pregnant womem, single-a baseball games, and real country music... none of that new crap... 
RAY'S POV: A CAR TURNED SIDEWAYS: its hazards blinking.

DAVE: i don't know, man. maybe we should keep going, find a phone -- 
RAY: no.
DAVE: the guy looks dead.
RAY: maybe not.

12C	EXT. MEDIAN - NIGHT: ray nears the body. he kneels down. 
RAY: hey, can you hear me?
12D	INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT: something flashes in the side-view mirror.

KARLA: girl, it's gettin' down to the wire. 
JULIE: he's not coming. i thought he was just...
KARLA: julie, you left four messages...
JULIE: but, he said he'd try.
KARLA: he said he'd try. try is like maybe.
JULIE: he does work hard.
KARLA: work hard, huh? he's breaking your heart just because he can. and i don't want to have to say i told you so...
JULIE: then, don't.
TYRELL: hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or we gonna get tropical?
JULIE: oh!
KARLA: hey, sorry... he's my friend, too. and that ticket is not going to waste.
WILL: julie, is everything cool? karla said...
KARLA: i said we start having fun. and that means now.
TYRELL: is there a problem here?
KARLA: where there's a will, there's a way. come on.
JULIE: you know what? this rocks. we're going to the bahamas!
KARLA: we goin' bahamas, i'm ty's bahama mama. we goin' bahamas...

JULIE: just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood. 
WILL: what if i don't have anything happy from childhood...sorry, i can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute... which is over seven hundred feet a second. imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
JULIE: deep breaths --
WILL: fumes build up in the fuel tanks. you can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. planes use o-rings...which freeze in tap water. planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
JULIE: you've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
WILL: right. planes get hit by lightning. they get hit by meteors. they hit other planes.
TYRELL: something is gonna hit your if you don't quit complaining.
KARLA: honey, some folks just can't fly.

JULIE: i'm the king of the world. 
KARLA: no, i'm the king of the world.
KARLA: remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' i do for a weekend once every ten years.
JULIE: i will, and you remind me of the same thing.
WILL: you just gotta breathe.
TYRELL: can't talk right now.
WILL: see, it's not a macho thing. it's about equilibrium in your inner ear. you could've used a patch, but it's too late now. get used to it. some folks just can't sail.
PAULSEN: that's too bad, too, because it's the only way on or off the island. unless you have an accident. and then they call the coast guard.
JULIE: it's pretty remote here.
PAULSEN: yep. that's what the tourists pay for -- sun, sea, and solitude.
TYRELL: are we there yet?
PAULSEN: few more minutes.

TYRELL: i feel like i'm still on that thing. 
DERRICK: that way for a complimentary planter's punch to get you readjusted.
TYRELL: i can get used to this.
DERRICK: welcome, fair princess, to tower bay. i'm derrick. at your service for the duration of your stay.
PAULSEN: i'm at your service, princess.
DERRICK: season's over old man. so i gotta work fast.
PAULSEN: if marine radio's right about the weather, you're already out of time.
FERRY -- LINE FORMS HERE.: our guys are already at the end of the dock.

KARLA: check it out. 
TOW BIKINI GIRLS: catch the eyes of tyrell and will.
TYRELL: yes, ma'am.

RASTA VOICE: anybudorsomethin'?
TITUS: my brother, can i interest you in the islands finest ganja?
WILL: hey, tyrell, we found you brother.
TYRELL: not possible.
TITUS: who be wantin' the kind, the uber- sticky, the bwana, the depth-charge, the up-all-night-laughing-with-your- friends? who wants it? 'cause titus got it.
WILL: no, thanks.
TITUS: come on, man. everybody wants something.
KARLA: take a bath, maybe.
TITUS: that's cold, but if that's how you want it. the group moves on. titus watches them go -- titus anybudorsomethin' you come and see me.

KARLA: hello? hello?

BROOKS: ah, yes. roll out the red carpet. our contest winners are here at last.
TYRELL: nice dog.
BROOKS: not really. i've found peices of guys like you in his stool. tyrell is put off by this aggressive comment.
TYRELL: what's your problem, buddy?
BROOKS: i don't have a problem in the world.
JULIE: it sure is a beautiful old hotel.
BROOKS: built in 1948 for a member of the rockefeller clan. the tile work was imported from spain. a lot of history in these walls...judy garland stayed here...hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
TYRELL: okay, we get it...it's old.
BROOKS: it'll outlive you, i'm sure.
KARLA: oh, what?
BROOKS: you're in 201 and 202.
KARLA: is that bad?
JULIE: your what?
BROOKS: honeymoon suites. i take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
JULIE: we haven't exchanged anything.
KARLA: julie, we're talkin' suites! that'll be just fine with us.
BROOKS: and, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
KARLA: wait...did you say off-season?
BROOKS: july fourth weekend. storm season starts today. the clouds roll in like clockwork.
JULIE: storm season?
BROOKS: it's our version of winter. 201 and 202. there's scrabble and parcheesi in the lobby. enjoy.

24	INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY: they walk down the hallway. karla seems annoyed. 
KARLA: ain't nothin' free in this world. everybody says it, and it's true. i wanted you all to have a good trip.
TYRELL: we will, baby...all this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
WILL: and it's been blue skies all day. it might be perfect all weekend.
JULIE: it beets being on the mainland.
KARLA: oooh, the mainland --
TYRELL: somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. tropical! the mood is improving. a squeeking noise interupts.
ESTES: 201 and 202...who put you in...? don't use these much --
JULIE: why's that?
ESTES: no real reason. pretty fancy rooms for kids your age.
KARLA: we won a competition.
ESTES: oh, yeah? what you have to do?
TYRELL: guess the capital of brazil --
KARLA: rio, baby!
ESTES: ahh, good for you, girl. ...and, where would you like me to put the bags?
KARLA: their stuff in there... ...and ours in here.
JULIE: karla! you promised.
KARLA: i also promised tyrell.
TYRELL: promised me what, baby? i made all my promises to william.
WILL: forward! a girl needs time to make up his mind. julie, look, if it's cool, i'll sleep on the couch and they can have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon.
WILL: i'll take those.
ESTES: no, i've been doing this since before you were a dream in your father's eye.
WILL: you sure it's okay with you?
JULIE: sure. it's fine. as long as you don't snore.
WILL: you can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.

25A	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT: we see a cop next to the doctor. 
COP: he's beaten up pretty bad --
DOCTOR: yes, but he seemed certain his friend was killed out on the highway by somebody named ben willis. he said he has a hook on his hand. he said he was driving a bmw.
25B	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT: close up: ray's eyes pop open. he's listening.
26	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT: the cop explains things to the doctor.
COP: there's no body. and there was no other vehical involved. he fell asleep at the wheel...and ran his old truck into a guardrail. he got thrown way the down into a ditch. he's lucky.
DOCTOR: he suffered a severe head trauma --
COP: probably once he rests up, it'll all come back to him.

NANCY: you guys lost? 
TYRELL: tell me this ain't the bar scene.
NANCY: wanna drink?
WILL: we didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
TYRELL: planter's punch, singapore sling, or how about a mai-tai?
NANCY: how about some id? they freeze. nancy kidding.
WILL: the guy at the desk said the place would be quiet, not dead.
NANCY: didn't anyone tell you this is --
TYRELL: the last day of the season. yeah, we heard.

NANCY: that's none of your business.

TYRELL: i like the sound of this.

TITUS: standing there smoking a spliff. 
DERRICK: get lost, you scared me.
TITUS: fish are all over the water...come on, let us take a boat out.
DERRICK: titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in spain.
TITUS: that's why you'll come with titus, mon.
DERRICK: there's a storm comin', titus. no boats are going out.
TITUS: storm is what makes it interesting. thass why all the fish are up. less hook us a couple big ones.
DERRICK: i got work to do. take the bake elsewhere.
TITUS: up-tighteous and self-righteous.
DERRICK: hello, little sea bass. you're lucky i'm busy or i'd hook you myself.

KARLA: you sure you didn't pick up my hair tie? 
TYRELL: hello?
KARLA: okay, i just didn't wanna get my hair wet.

KARLA: don't you get feisty...
TYRELL: too late for that. we're miles from anywhere, baby. no one's gonna hear you scream.
KARLA: i used to be a lifeguard...i'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
TITUS: surface in the pool next to them.

TYRELL: what's the policy on burnin' herb?
TITUS: we got one for that, too. it's don't try until you buy. you don't buy any, you don't get any.

JULIE: i am not crazy, tyrell. he was right there.
TYRELL: fine. show me the body.
KARLA: think about this, julie. what did you actually see?
JULIE: the dockhand guy. hanging by his neck from up there.
BROOKS: in the morning we'll talk to derrick, the "dockhand guy," and put the whole thing to rest. now, let's slow down on the dark and stormies and get some sleep.
NANCY: don't look at me --
JULIE: i want off this island.
BROOKS: not possible, i'm afraid. the last ferry left hours ago. and we got a storm coming. there won't be another one for days.
TYRELL: there's a storm coming?
BROOKS: 'tis the season, like i told you. it's a big one. julie goes for the phone.
JULIE: then i'll call the mainland for a charter.
BROOKS: phones went down a few minutes ago.
JULIE: it's dead.
BROOKS: duh. the next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
KARLA: what about a radio?
BROOKS: sorry. emergencies only.
KARLA: what the would you call this?
BROOKS: i'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts. all we can do now is batten down and ride it out. if things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
JULIE: looks out the window with glazed-over eyes.

MAC: jeez, that's a full carat -- 
RAY: how much?
MAC: well, there's some flaws in her...
RAY: how much?
MAC: don't really have the market for something like this... i can go two...two-fifty.
RAY: make it three hundred. and throw that in, too.
REVEAL - .38 REVOLVER: encased in a glass cabinet.
MAC: hell, that's worth three, easy. and you got your waiting period.
RAY: i'm not waiting...so give me the gun and keep the ring.
MAC: fine, buddy.

TYRELL: this ain't the romantic weekend i had in mind. 
KARLA: you get any sleep at all?
JULIE: some.
TYRELL: oh, look. another day in paradise with julie-your-tour-director...miss psychotic episode.
KARLA: hey --
TYRELL: see any dead bodies out there? any fresh kill? how 'bout freddy, jason?
WILL: leave her alone.
TYRELL: i'm just saying what all of you are thinking. it's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
WILL: you don't have to be a jerk.
JULIE: it's okay...he doesn't believe me. that's his right. i'm starting to think i'm crazy, too.
KARLA: hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...what do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?

JULIE: nice move. 
KARLA: i'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.

TYRELL: where is everybody? 
TYRELL: shut up.
43	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY: they cross the lobby.
WILL: hello? there's nobody here, tyrell.

TYRELL: they're around...they just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners. let's go find stoner boy...make his lazy hook us up with fishing poles or ping-pong paddles or something. 
WILL: you know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
TYRELL: hey -- shut up, okay?

TYRELL: hang on...

JULIE: i'm not crazy...i'm not crazy. he's here... we've got to get to the radio and call for help.

TYRELL: somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho. 
KARLA: we gotta get out of here. now.

JULIE: ben willis.
KARLA: oh, stop it! he's dead. you killed him. now, get over it. we gotta think here.
JULIE: they never found the body.
KARLA: julie...
JULIE: only he wasn't dead. he killed barry and helen last july fourth.
TYRELL: we're on an island, miles from anywhere. i don't give a about you're fisherman. there's dead bodies pilling up everywhere and there's one guy missing -- will moves closer to tyrell --
WILL: the porter...what's his name? old asbestos --
TYRELL: estes! that's exactly who it is. that old guy knows something. we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
KARLA: julie, we have to do something.
JULIE: it's not him.

OLD LADY: people live healthy in miami. it's the future down there every day of the week...the future. 
RAY: i'll keep that in mind.

TYRELL: yo, freak boy -- the cluttered room is empty. 
WILL: he's not here.
TYRELL: we're gonna find some weird in here.

THE LITTLE STRAW MAN: impaled on a fishhook. 
JULIE: voodoo.
TYRELL: i told you.
TYRELL: missing a hair tie?
TYRELL: we found our guy.

WILL: let's go.
65	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT: the men head into the kitchen and bar area.

ESTES: no --
JULIE: let him go. i believe him.
KARLA: come on, julie. you saw his room.
ESTES: i haven't hurt anyone...i stole those things to help you. to protect you.
JULIE: he's telling the truth. he could've easily killed me. he didn't. look, we didn't even answer the radio question right...this whole thing was a setup.
KARLA: what do you mean?
JULIE: rio isn't the capital of brazil. it was the wrong answer. sorry, we lose.
TYRELL: you've got all these theories but where is he? where? where's your fisherman killer?
JULIE: i don't know.
TYRELL: you never do...the guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. little notes that only mean something to you. how do we even know you're not the one behind this -- estes steps forward --
JULIE: how do we know you're not?
ESTES: i know who you're talking about. he used to work here at the hotel. and i've seen him around again. out in the woods by the orchard.
ESTES: i can't remeber his name, but i don't forget a face. i can show you...
WILL: how do we know you're not setting us up?
ESTES: where else you gonna go, son?
KARLA: i know i don't want to stay in here.
JULIE: we'll be better off in the open. if we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
TYRELL: show us.

PAULSEN: what the... 
RAY: i need to get to tower bay island.
PAULSEN: we're closed.
RAY: i need to get there, now. paulsen looks at him standing there drenched.
PAULSEN: did you happen to notice what's going on outside?
RAY: i'm not looking for a weather report, i'm looking for a boat. so which one's yours?

ESTES: he worked here for many years. he had a nice family. a pretty wife and two little ones. a boy and a girl. they'd be about your age, now. they continue along the path. 
JULIE: did he do it?
ESTES: people say she was running around on him. people say he caught her in bed with other men. people say a lot of things. he disappeared, taking the two small ones with him. at least they were never found.
KARLA: be careful, julie.
JULIE: i've got to see.

JULIE JAMES: born september 6, 1979 died july 4, 1998 "a lying whore" "a lying whore" is scratched with a knife. 
KARLA: ...today's july fourth.
JULIE: i'm not dying on this island, will. do you hear me? julie shouts into the darkness. julie you want me, ben willis? come and get me. i'm right here. she kicks over her headstone -- julie my grave stays empty!
KARLA: julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. there's no way off this place.
JULIE: then, we fight -- will looks around. estes is gone.
WILL: where'd estes go?
TYRELL: what is up with that weirdo?
WILL: i'll go find him.
KARLA: why? he can't help us.
WILL: he's probably the only one who can help us.
TYRELL: i'll come with you.
KARLA: are you crazy? we're not staying here on our own.
WILL: it's okay. he couldn't have gone far. i'll catch up with you later.
KARLA: maybe we should just wait here?
TYRELL: i'm not hiding up no tree. i'm with her. let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's

TYRELL: what i need is a gun. not a steak knife. karla grabs a paring knife -- tyrell you gonna clean vegetables? you gonna stir-fry? you need something that'll get his attention. 
KARLA: i'm your best friend...you could have told me the truth about what happened. i would've understood.
JULIE: karla, i just wanted the whole thing to be over. i didn't want to involve anybody else.
KARLA: it's too late for that.
JULIE: i'm so sorry. i brought this on everyone. it's my fault.
TYRELL: forget that. you didn't do nothing. this fisherman's a piece of scum. i should've been listening to you... i'm sorry. julie smiles for a second. tyrell now, let's take a look at the pantry.
KARLA: you think that's a good place to hide?
TYRELL: i don't know, but i'm starving.

NANCY: give me a boost up -- 
A WOODEN LADDER: pulls down. nancy quickly climbs up.
BEN WILLIS: enters the hallway and continues toward them.

JULIE: there's no way to lock it. 
KARLA: what do we do?

NANCY: watch your step...

BEN: you'd be amazed by what you'd see. my wife with every man on the island, for example. and you, sexy...i loved watching you.

JULIE: will, just hold on. we'll get you fixed up.

JULIE: you've got blood everywhere, but i can't find the wound. 
WILL: that's because it's not my blood. the slow change in julie as she realizes... she starts to run. will roughly grabs her. will it's time you woke up, julie.
