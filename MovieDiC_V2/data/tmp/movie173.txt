MULVANEY: you know i do. you seem to know a lot about bank procedure.
SONNY: don't ask me questions. i got connections. you find out who i am, you're cold meat.
MULVANEY: i don't care who you are... i just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
SONNY: what if i take you with me?
MULVANEY: if you take anybody, please take me.
SONNY: they'll shoot you; the cops'll shoot you... they don't give a in spite of that bank insurance. you see what they did in attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
SONNY: anyway, i'm not gonna take you. i'm gonna take one of the girls, a married one with a couple of kids. the cops don't like it in the papers when they kill a mother, especially if she's got young kids.

SONNY: i frisk you?
MORETTI: you frisk me.

MORETTI: i'd like just some sign i can trust you too, sonny. i don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me. some sight... right?
SONNY: sure... like... i'm not gonna shoot you.
MORETTI: how about letting the people out of the bank. why put them in this position?
SONNY: they're what's keeping me alive. you think you're dealing with an idiot? talk to me then.
MORETTI: okay, give us the women.
SONNY: oh, no... women is all we got.
MORETTI: you're all one way! i'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin'... give me one of them, anyway... just one...
SONNY: so -- you want me to send one out there... okay. i'll see what i can do.
SONNY: he wants one.

HEIDI: the transistor goes sonny what? i couldn't believe my ears, so i shut the transistor, get outta here, who needs this? i say sonny didn't do it. it's not him to rob a bank. it's not him to hurt anybody, to threaten anybody, to steal or do anything wrong. 'cause he's never done nothin' wrong from the day i know him.

HEIDI: and things are adding in my head, how crazy he's been acting, and in with a bad crowd, an' i look at him, he's yellin' at the kids like a madman. so inna car i said to him, sonny, what you gonna do with the gun? you gonna shoot me and dump my body inna river or what? i was so scared of him, i never been scared of sonny never. you know, his mother says the cops was always at our house, we was always fighting. i hit him with the jack in the car once, but i only missed and hit myself, you should of seen my leg. and all he would ever do is put on his coat and go out. so they say it's sonny but i don't believe it. 
COP 1: lady, you saw him. you saw his gun.
HEIDI: he might of done it, his body functions might of done it, but not he himself.
SONNY: let's say i put a gun to your head and i tell you to kill a cop... and you did. who'd go to the electric chair... you or me?
MARIA: you would... you told me to do it.
SONNY: but you shot him.
MIRIAM: but you told her to.
SONNY: yeah - but you did it.

JESUS FREAK: christ is coming back and he's really pissed. 
SONNY: yeah, well i don't blame him.
JESUS FREAK: you know, sonny, i used to dope a lot, and i was into dipping? and i did a couple bank jobs, and the lord in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
SONNY: no. look, we're kind of....
JESUS FREAK: that's why i can talk to you, as an equal, sonny. you got to merge your whole soul with and then you are him and one with the holy ghost.

SONNY: leon! happy birthday!

COP ON PHONE: moretti - he wants to talk to you. 
SONNY: is he all right? is he all right?
MORETTI: he's all doped up.
SONNY: i want to talk to him.
MORETTI: he's groggy, sonny. let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back.

MORETTI: leon? whatsa matter? they give you a shot down the hospital or what? 
LEON: oh, they shot me with like unreal!
MORETTI: well, you got to get hold of yourself. you got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
LEON: oh no!
MORETTI: he's got eight people in there with him. he's got this kid with him... they're gonna shoot the people.
LEON: i can't help it. i can't stop him from anything.
MORETTI: if he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
LEON: he won't listen to anybody. he's been very crazy all summer. since june he's been trying to kill me.
MORETTI: you try calling the police?
LEON: what good is that? they couldn't stop him. and it'd just make him mad. they don't know him.
MORETTI: somebody's got to stop him, leon.
LEON: he was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
MORETTI: he's makin' threats in there.
LEON: he's scared. it's crazy. i never met anyone like him. his wife, he's a wonderful father to his children. his mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. unbelievable. i wanted to get married... he didn't really want it... he's married already! but he did it. i don't know why. i thought it would help me, but it didn't. i was just as confused and unhappy was before; i did terrible things.
MORETTI: what kind of things, leon?
LEON: ten days i spent in atlantic city - sonny was frantic - he knew i was drinking; he didn't know where i was... who i was with. i couldn't explain why i did the things i did. so i went to this psychiatrist who explained to me i was a woman in a man's body. so sonny right away wanted to get me money for a change operation: but where was he to get that? 2500 dollars! my he's in hock up to his ears already.
MORETTI: he needed money? for the operation for you?
LEON: it made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages. and i got more depressed than ever; i saw i'd never get the operation. so i tried to take my life - i swallowed about a half pound of pills... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers... you name it. but i just threw them up and wound up in the hospital. sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'wow!' so when i hear he's in the bank, i almost go crazy because i know he's doin' it for me.
MORETTI: well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
LEON: i can't talk to him.
MORETTI: you're in it up to your ass, leon. you're an accessory. you talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
LEON: i'm afraid.
MORETTI: how is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
LEON: i don't know what to say to him. i can't.
MORETTI: you think it over, leon.

MORETTI: he won't talk to you. let me work on it. 
TV NEWSMAN: ...police are questioning leon, a year-old admitted homosexual, who claims to have been married to one of the bank robbers in a ceremony last november... [etc.]...

SAL: sonny, you hear that? 
SONNY: what?
SAL: they keep sayin' two homosexuals. i'm not a homosexual. i want you to stop them saying that.
SONNY: that's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them. i can't control it, sal - let'em say what they want. forget it. it don't matter.

SAL: that's it, sonny. 
MORETTI: sonny... sonny... come out a minute... come out a minute...
SHELDON: we're all set at kennedy.
MORETTI: what makes you think you'll be able to control it?
SHELDON: he's totally unstable. he'll make a mistake.
MORETTI: he hasn't so far. i'm the one who can make a mistake. that's what scares the out of me.
SHELDON: eugene, at 3:07, this became federal. why don't i take it over now?

SONNY: moretti? what the is goin' on?

SHELDON: i've got a jet. i'll have airport limousine here in a half hour. i want the hostages.

SONNY: well, these hostages are keeping me alive.
SHELDON: okay, when do i get them?
SONNY: at the airport. we get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. except one.
SHELDON: i want them all.
SONNY: i want to talk to leon.
SHELDON: i want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
SONNY: you got guts. you think if sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
SHELDON: i have to see.
SONNY: it's the fbi. he wants to come in.
SAL: have him walk in backwards.

SONNY: you'd like to kill me, too. 
SHELDON: i wouldn't like to, but i will, if i have to.
SONNY: nothin' personal, huh? the man that kills me, i want him to do it because he hates my guts. not because it's a job. okay, let's go... but you gotta walk in backwards.

SONNY: nobody give their right name... it's the fbi! 
SHELDON: i just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
TWO SHOT - SYLVIA AND SAL: she's pissed.
SYLVIA: listen, we asked for the jet hours ago, what are you doin' out there?
SHELDON: it's all being set up, we'll have you out of here in a couple of hours.
SHELDON: they're getting what they want. we just want to be sure we get what we want, which is to get all you ladies out safe. and you two boys, too.
SAL: you got to talk to the tv, tell them to stop talking about the two homosexuals. i'm not gay... that's the truth. tell 'em that.
SHELDON: i will. sonny? outside for a minute?
SONNY: sal?
SAL: they gotta stop sayin' that.

SHELDON: sonny, you handled yourself real well. a lot of men would have choked, and we'd have a lot of chaos and panic and maybe a death or a multiple death on our hands, but you handled it. i respect that. don't you try to take sal. we'll handle him. you just sit tight and you won't get hurt. 
SONNY: wait a minute! what the you tryin' to tell me?

SAL: what'd he say? 
SONNY: he was talkin' about arrangements... we were talkin' about the tv.
SAL: why couldn't he talk about that here?
SONNY: he was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, sal. what's wrong with him?
SONNY: hey, you okay?
SYLVIA: he's got diabetes. he's not a well person.
SONNY: those -- they poisoned the pizza! sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
MULVANEY: i didn't eat any pizza.
SYLVIA: i told you, he's got diabetes.
SONNY: you're supposed to balance your sugar diet, right?
SONNY: hey! is there a doctor over there? get him over here! come on, on the double!
SHELDON: what's wrong?
SONNY: the manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
SHELDON: doctor...

SONNY: well, you know... moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
LEON: yeah. it was terrible.
SONNY: that... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
LEON: you come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy. and they start putting things in your arm... you know. how do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
SONNY: yeah...
LEON: you can't talk or do anything. you really feel... you know... i'm just sort of coming out of it now.

LEON: what? what are you talking about? you are dying? did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
SONNY: what are you talking about?
LEON: what do you mean... what am i talking about? do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life? i am dying. do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
SONNY: now don't give me that deep now. don't start with that
LEON: no really... i don't think that you realize what it means. the things that you do, sonny. you put a gun to somebody's head...
SONNY: i don't know what i'm doing.
LEON: yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when i pull the trigger. death? don't talk about death to me. i have been living with death for the last six months. why do you think i'm in the hospital? i take a handful of pills to get away from you. and then here i am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again. i have no friends left. no job. i can't live. i have to live with people. this death business... i'm sorry!
SONNY: i'm not on the phone to talk to you about that. well, i don't know what to say, leon. when you gimme that... when you hit me with that i mean, what am i supposed to say?
LEON: i'm sorry...
SONNY: i told you. that i got a lot of pressures. you said to me that you needed money, and i knew that you needed money! i saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and i said... man, i got to get this guy some money.
LEON: but i didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
SONNY: all right. i know you didn't ask me. you didn't ask me but i did it.
LEON: well...
SONNY: i did it on my own. i did this all on my own. i ain't laying it on anybody. nothing on anybody. i'll tell you something, though, it's about time that i squared away my accounts... you know. i am squaring away my accounts with life. maybe this whole thing is gonna end, somehow. maybe it'll just end! maybe i'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. that would be all right too! i said... i thought i would square it away with you... you know? that i would get you down here and that i would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
LEON: what trip?
SONNY: i'm getting out of here, man. i'm not going to stay here and i'm not giving up. i mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway. so it! but, if i can get out of this... i am going to get out. and, how i'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and i'm flying the out... that's all, leon. if you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come. you're free to do what you want.
LEON: i'm free to do what i want? and you think i would want to go with you some place on a plane? where?
SONNY: i gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the outta this thing. and we're gonna go, man!

SONNY: we can't stay here.
VI: oh my i don't understand. if you needed money, why couldn't you come to me? everything i got is yours. i got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings. it's yours. you know it.
SONNY: mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport. you understand? if you're here - they're not gonna send it. they'll think i'm gonna come out with you.
VI: what's wrong with that? the fbi was very understanding when i explained it to him. everybody knows it isn't you... it's the pressures from your home life.
SONNY: for sake don't start in on heidi again...
VI: did i say a thing against her? forbid i should say anything against that fat
SONNY: mom. mom. there are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
VI: if she comes down here, so help me i'm gonna mash her brains in. everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her. since then, forget it.
SONNY: she doesn't have anything to do with it! you understand that? mother? this is me!
VI: i know you wouldn't need leon if heidi was treating you right. the thing i don't understand is why you come out and sleep with heidi anyway? you got two kids on welfare now. what're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
SONNY: not now, mom, please.
VI: what'll you do? come out.
SONNY: i can't, mom. if i come out sal will kill them.
VI: oh. run.
SONNY: what the for? twenty-five years in the pen?
VI: maybe...
SONNY: maybe! aw christ, what dreams you live on! maybe what?
SONNY: i'm a fuckup and an outcast. there isn't one single person in my life i haven't hurt through my love. you understand that? i'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if i love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, over and out!
VI: no!
SONNY: did pop come down?
VI: no. this really him off, sonny. he says you're dead. he says he doesn't have a son.
SONNY: he's right. you shoulda done what he did. go home. don't talk to the fbi anymore. he walks away and moves toward the bank door.
