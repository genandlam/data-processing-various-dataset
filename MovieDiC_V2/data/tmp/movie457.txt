JUDY: no.
RAY: did you stop to talk to anyone, judy? do you enjoy that?
JUDY: no. i don't even know why i do it.
RAY: do you think you can get back at your dad that way? i mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention. did you ever think of that?
JUDY: i'll never get close to anybody.
RAY: some kids stomped a man on twelfth street, judy.

FATHER: then what is it? i can't even touch you anymore but you pull away. i want to understand you. why'd you get drunk? you must have had a reason.

RAY: try the desk.
RAY: that why you moved from the last town? 'cause you were in trouble? you can talk about it if you want to--i know about it anyway.

RAY: you were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there.
JIM: mess that kid up?
JIM: he called me chicken.
RAY: and your folks didn't understand?
JIM: they never do.
RAY: so then you moved?
JIM: they think i'll make friends if we move. just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
RAY: but you don't think that's a solution.
RAY: things pretty tough for you at home?
JIM: she eats him alive and he takes it.
JIM: what a zoo!
RAY: what?
JIM: a zoo. he always wants to be my pal, you know? but how can i give him anything when he's--i mean i love him and i don't want to hurt him--but i don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
RAY: pretty mixed up?
JIM: if he could--
RAY: "if he could" what? you mean your father?
JIM: i mean if he had the guts to knock mom cold once i bet she'd be happy and i bet she'd stop picking. they make mush out of him. just mush. one thing i know is i never want to be like him.
RAY: chicken?
JIM: i bet you see right through me, don't you?
JIM: how can anyone grow up in this circus?
RAY: you got me, jim--but they do. want some water?
JIM: boy--if i had one day when i didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or i felt i belonged some place.
RAY: here. look, will you do something for me? if the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze. it's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
JIM: okay--
RAY: any time--day or night. you calmed down enough to go back now?
JIM: you serious? ray smiles and opens the door.
JIM: i'm sorry.
MOTHER: all right, darling.
GRANDMA: this was all very unfortunate, but he made a mistake and he's sorry-- so we're not going to have any more trouble. he's always been a lovely boy--

LECTURER: for many days before the end of our earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star, increasingly bright and increasingly near. 
LECTURER: as this star approaches us, the weather will change. the great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide, and the seas will turn warmer.
LECTURER: the last of us search the heavens and stand amazed. for the stars will still be there, moving through their ancient rhythms.
LECTURER: the familiar constellations that illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed, eternal, unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise.
LECTURER: orion, the hunter. plato looks off.
JIM: boy!
PLATO: what?
JIM: once you been up there, you know you been some place!
LECTURER: gemini, the twins.
LECTURER: cancer, the crab.
BUZZ: i'm a crab! she laughs. so do the others.
LECTURER: taurus, the bull.
JIM: moo! he waits for approval.
CRUNCH: yeah, moo.
BUZZ: moo. that's real cute. moo.
GOON: hey, he's real rough--
CRUNCH: i bet he fights with cows.
BUZZ: moo.
LECTURER: sagittarius and aries--all as they have ever been.
PLATO: you shouldn't monkey with him.
JIM: what?
PLATO: he's a wheel. so's she. it's hard to make friends with them.
JIM: i don't want to make friends.
LECTURER: and while the flash of our beginning has not yet traveled the light years into distance--
LECTURER: has not yet been seen by planets deep within the other galaxies, we will disappear into the blackness of the space from which we came.
LECTURER: destroyed as we began in a burst of gas and fire.
LECTURER: the heavens are still and cold once more. in all the complexity of our universe and the galaxies beyond, the earth will not be missed.
LECTURER: through the infinite reaches of space, the problems of man seem trivial and naive indeed. and man, existing alone, seems to be an episode of little consequences.
LECTURER: that's all. thank you very much.
JIM: hey, it's over. the world ended.
PLATO: what does he know about man alone?
PLATO: excuse me. excuse me.
MALE TEACHER: john, where you going?

PLATO: jim?
JIM: i'm here.
PLATO: they're still there!
PLATO: jim--do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
JIM: no. in the morning.
JIM: i just have a feeling.
PLATO: if you don't want trouble, i know a place we can go-- jim looks up at him.
PLATO: it's a big mansion and we could sneak around there and they wouldn't even know. you could be safe-- they turn a corner quickly.

JUDY'S MOTHER: bertha! you can serve the souffle! fish souffle. you don't have to stand there, darling. drink your tomato juice.
JUDY: i guess i just don't understand anything.
JUDY'S FATHER: i'm tired, judy. i'd like to change the subject.
JUDY: why?
JUDY'S FATHER: i'd like to, that's all. girls your age don't do that. you need an explanation?

JIM: what can you do when you have to be a man?
FATHER: well, now--
JIM: just give me a direct answer! you going to stop me from going, dad?
FATHER: you know i never stop you from anything. believe me--you're at a wonderful age. in ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
JIM: ten years? now, dad--i need an answer now!

JIM: i'm in terrible trouble.--you know that big high bluff near miller- town junction?
FATHER: sure--there was a bad accident there. they showed the pictures on

JIM: i was in it. 
MOTHER: how!
JIM: it doesn't matter how. i was driving a stolen car--
MOTHER: do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
JIM: mom--i'm not--
MOTHER: and you wanted him to make a list!
FATHER: will you let him tell it!
JIM: she never wants to hear. she doesn't care!
MOTHER: i guess when i nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much i don't care!
FATHER: just relax, please relax!
JIM: i told you dad, it was a question of honor. they called me chicken-- you know, chicken! i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again. so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other. we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff. i got out okay but buzz didn't. he was killed.
MOTHER: good lord!
JIM: i can't keep it to myself anymore--
FATHER: well, just get it off your chest, son.
JIM: that's not what i mean. i've never done anything right. i've been going around with my head in a sling for years...i don't want to drag you into this but i can't help it. i don't think i can prove anything by going around pretending i'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
FATHER: you're absolutely right!
JIM: are you listening to me? you're involved in this! i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight?
FATHER: you what?
MOTHER: no!
FATHER: did anyone see you there? i mean did they get your license number or anything?
JIM: i don't think so--
FATHER: well--
MOTHER: what about the other boys--do you think they'll go to the police?
JIM: what's that got to do with it?
MOTHER: why should you be the only one.
FATHER: look jim. far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
MOTHER: are you going to preach now? are we going to have a sermon?
FATHER: i'm just explaining what you mean! you can't be an idealist all your life! nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
MOTHER: that's right!
JIM: except yourself!
FATHER: will you wait a minute?
JIM: you don't want me to go.
MOTHER: no! i don't want you to go to the police! there were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
JIM: but i am involved! we're all involved, mom! a boy was killed! i don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
FATHER: you know you did wrong. that's the main thing, isn't it?
JIM: no! it's nothing! just nothing! you always told me to tell the truth. you think you can just turn that off?
MOTHER: he's not saying that! he's saying don't volunteer!
JIM: just tell a little white lie?
FATHER: you'll learn as you get a little older, jim.
JIM: i don't want to learn that!
MOTHER: well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
JIM: no! you're not tearing me loose any more.
MOTHER: do i have to spell it out?
JIM: you're not going to use me as an excuse again, mom. every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. now i want to do one thing right and i'm not letting you run away. dad?
FATHER: son--this is all happening so fast--
JIM: you better give me something, dad. you better give me something mom?
MOTHER: jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
JIM: dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
JIM: dad?
MOTHER: stop it! you'll kill him! jim! do you want to kill your father?

JUDY: neither can i.
JIM: no? why not? you know something? sometimes i figure i'll never live to see my next birthday. isn't that dumb?
JUDY: no.
JIM: every day i look in the mirror and say, "what? you still here?" man!
JIM: hey! you smiled!
JIM: like even today. i woke up this morning, you know? and the sun was shining and everything was nice. then the first thing that happens is i see you and i thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
JUDY: i'm sorry i treated you mean today. you shouldn't believe what i say when i'm with the kids. nobody acts sincere.
JIM: why'd you get mixed up with them?
JUDY: if you knew me you wouldn't say that.
JIM: i don't think you trust anybody, do you?
JUDY: why?
JIM: i'm getting that way, too.

JIM: i felt like it.
JUDY: your lips are soft when you kiss.
JIM: where you going?
JUDY: i don't know, but we can't stay here.
JIM: where can we go? i can't go back into that zoo.
JUDY: i'm never going back.
JIM: listen! i know a place! plato showed me before. an old deserted mansion near the planetarium would you go with me?
JIM: you can trust me, judy.
JUDY: i feel as if i'm walking under water.

JIM: wowee ow wow! let's take it for the summer.
JUDY: oh, jim!
JIM: no--come on. should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
JUDY: you decide, darling. remember our budget.
PLATO: don't give it a thought. only three million dollars a month!
JUDY: oh, we can manage that! i'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
JIM: why don't we just rent it for the season?
JUDY: you see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling. i'm so embarrassed i could die!
JIM: well--we're newlyweds.
JUDY: there's just one thing. what about--
PLATO: children? well, we really don't encourage them. they're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
JUDY: yes. and so terribly annoying when they cry. i just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
JIM: of course. drown them like puppies.
JUDY: see, we're very modern.
PLATO: shall i show you the nursery? it's far away from the rest of the house. if you have children--oh i hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice. in fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
JUDY: talk to them! heavens!
JIM: nobody talks to children! they just tell them one thing and mean another.
PLATO: it's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too! you know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
JIM: what?
PLATO: there's only one key.
JIM: we'll take it!
PLATO: come on!

MOOSE: what time is it? 
CRUNCH: hang loose. we got all night.
MOOSE: that maid saw us. she could identify us too.
CRUNCH: you still want to go home, moose?
MOOSE: no.
CRUNCH: then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
GOON: what guts?

JIM: quick! fill the pool! 
JIM: let's see how long we can stay under.
PLATO: man, you're schizoid!
JIM: i'm what? what?
JUDY: you can't talk underwater!
JIM: i bet you hear everything i say!
PLATO: isn't he schizoid?
JIM: hey! how 'bout that!
PLATO: haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
JIM: not lately.
JIM: how do you know so much about this junk, plato?
PLATO: i had to go to a head-shrinker. i only went twice though. my mother said it cost too much, so she went to hawaii instead.
JIM: no. seriously. what's your trouble?
PLATO: i don't know but whatever it is, it's gone now. i mean i'm happy now. here.
PLATO: i came here before.
JIM: when was that?
PLATO: when i was here? when i ran away. i used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
JIM: who?
PLATO: mom and dad. i used to be in my crib and i'd listen to them fight.
JIM: you remember that far back? boy, i can't even remember yesterday.
JUDY: plato, where's your father now?
PLATO: he's dead. he was a hero in the china sea.
JIM: you told me he's a big wheel in new york!

JUDY: it's all right.
JIM: sure.
JIM: you have a long life-line.
JUDY: so have you.
JIM: ever been in a place like this before?
JUDY: not exactly. it's certainly huge.

JIM: want to read any books? take your pick! isn't this the craziest?

JIM: why?
JUDY: i don't know--you just are. leaving a light for plato. that was nice.

JUDY: are you?
JIM: here we are-- out of cigarettes-- junior's in the nurs'ry-- see how late it gets--
JUDY: you don't need to do that.
JIM: there's something i should tell you, judy.
