MS. BERRY: "work." today we're going to share what our parents do for work. 
JEFF: my dad is a truck driver.
MELINDA: my mommy is a doctor.
CAROLYN: my dad is a librarian and my mom is a vegetarian.
THEODORE: my father is a struck-sher-al- engine-ear.
KELLY: my daddy works at a place where they make stuff, and my mommy is a mommy.
ELLIOT: looking a little
CRAZED): my father is a postal worker.
MAX: my mom's a teacher.
MS. BERRY: and your dad?
MAX: my dad? he's . . . a liar.

MS. BERRY: a liar? i don't think you mean "a liar." 
MAX: well... he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and--
MS. BERRY: oh! i see-- you mean he's a lawyer.

FLETCHER: a dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. the prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. 
FLETCHER: well, for once i agree with t he prosecutor. this is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client.
FLETCHER: put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs.

FLETCHER: and in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf. only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an atm machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card. 
FLETCHER: as you stand over his crumpled, though potentially still-dangerous form, your he art goes out to him. you want to help. first, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi ng away. second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify, you take his wallet. finally, you leap into the man's lexus to head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up. you breathe a sigh of relief: "someone to look -after the injured man! oh joy!" but do the police applaud your initiative? do they hail your heroism? no-- they arrest you and throw you in the slammer!
IMPRESSIVE: moment, then answers his own
QUESTION:): discrimination,
QUESTION:): but this time it's not based on race.
JUROR): not based on gender.
JUROR): no--this time it's discrimination based on size! . i know what the prosecution wants you to think - - i t ' s always the big guy's fault. is that what we've come to as a society -- persecuting people because they're large?
FLETCHER: shame on you, mister prosecutor! shame on you!
JURY): the state is trying to barbeque my client on the spit of justice. only you can douse the flames. the decision is your s. and please...don't let your emotions run away with y ou . the fact that my client is a family man, raising his sons alone after the tragic death of their mother, has absolutely no bearing on this case.
JURY): instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower!

LAWYER: how's it going, fletcher? 
FLETCHER: another gratifying day serving justice.
CLIENT: hey great job, mr. reid. i wish there was some way i could show my appreciation.
FLETCHER: stay out of my neighborhood after dark.
PUBLICIST: mr. reid, do you have a â· moment-?
FLETCHER: no, i'm late picking up my son.
PUBLICIST: -because a couple of reporters want to interview you about your big win today.
FLETCHER    ..: how's my hair?

MAX: what time is it? 
AUDREY: checks her
WATCH): i ' m sure he just got tied up in court again.
MAX: dad!
FLETCHER: maximillian!

FLETCHER: and who is this lovely lady?
MAX: that's no lady, that's mom!
AUDREY. Â·: thanks, max.

BREATH): himnm. . . i don't remember her looking that good, malfunction in vector 4! malfunction in vector 4!
AUDREY: keep vector 4 away from me. unless you want vector 4 chopped off.
FLETCHER: you know, you were much easier when we were married... so where are you off too?
AUDREY: stanford. i'm delivering a paper.
FLETCHER: o h really? where i live, we use a boy on a bike.
MAX: hey mom, dad's taking me to see wrestling!

FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE: the boy must learn the way of the war rior . an d wh o be tter to teach him than rowdy rod- . piper and big john stud? 
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE: he must be schooled in the way of the face-claw, the sleeper- hold, and the purple nuxple.
AUDREY: shut up!!
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE: the squaw will never understand us.
JERRY: max, my man!
JERRY: fletcher, good to see you?

FLETCHER: t o stanford? overnight? does this mean you two are...
AUDREY: i've been seeing him seven months, what do you think?
FLETGHER: i was hoping that after being married to me, you'd have no more strength left.
AUDREY: . well you have to remember when we were married, i wasn't having nearly as often as you were.
FLETCHER: medic!! i've been hit.

FLETCHER: well, great... i'm so happy for you two. i am just mister h appy man. happy, happy, happy. 
AUDREY: relax, fletcher. it looks like jerry's taking that job offer in boston.
FLETCHER: aud, i am so sorry...

JERRY: calling to 
AUDREY): ready?
FLETCHER: yo u gonna be okay? because if not, we could leave max with your sister and i could go out with you two, does that appeal to you at all?
FLETCHER: wave to the soon-to-be ex- boyfriend, max.
KEYS): you drive.
MAX: dad, are we really going to go to wrestling?
FLETCHER: absolutely, maxattacker. we just have to stop by the office for one minute.

PHILIP: when?
FLETCHER: soon.
PHILIP: how 'bout tonight?

FLETCHER: not that soon. i'm taking max to see wrestling--

MAX: what are you doing?
FLETCHER: oh, i'm... fixing the card, look, they spelled mr. allan's name wrong. have an apple.

FRED: i can't do it. 
M IRANDA: fred, it's your duty to present the strongest case possible.
FRED: the strongest case possible, consistent with the truth.
MIRANDA: let the judge decide what's true. that's what he gets paid for. you get paid to win.
FRED: if you insist on my taking it to trial, i'll represent mrs. cole aggressively and ethically. but, miranda -- i won't lie.
MIRANDA: then we'll just have to find someone who'will.

FLETCHER: hey, pete! great tie! â·.

FLETCHER: as if i don't have anything better to do than bow and scrape at her royal perfumed p artner feet. tell her i'm in court.
GRETA: court's closed.
FLETCHER: tell her i broke my leg and had to be shot.
GRETA: why don't you tell her yourself?

FLETCHER: --and then send out a notice of judgement on my win today! 
GRETA: i'll get right on it.
FLETCHER: miranda! i didn't see you. hey, you look lovely, today.
FLETCHER: he grabs greta's gift and hands it to miranda.
MIRANDA: thanks. i heard about your victory today. you're making quite an impression on the partnership committee.

MAX: we're not going, are we? 
FLETCHER: of course we are. a promise i s a promise. we are gonna see wrestling or my name isn't fletcher t. reid.

FLETCHER: could you hand me that? 
DOES): thank you.
UP): we are having some fun, eh maxer?

AUDREY: are you alright? 
JERRY: uh, yeah, just, uh... how long are you gonna be on the phone?
AUDREY: i just wanted to say good- night to max, but he must still be out with fletcher,
JERRY: will you marry me?

AUDREY: uh...would i . . . ? what did you say? 
JERRY: i proposed, i . . . look, i know this boston thing is a great opportunity, good job, mo ney .. . everything. but i started to think about being three thousand miles away from you and max. and i didn't like it. i-- look, i know it's a lot to ask, to move and everything, but i . . . . i love

FLETCHER: max factor... happy birthday. how old are you today? 
MAX: five.
FLETCHER: well, you've held up well. i only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to mark this day, like....
FLETCHER: . . . a present! .
FLETCHER: max eyes it with wonder.
MAX: what is it?
FLETCHER: it's... it's. a surprise.

FLETCHER: baseball stuff. 
MAX: will you play catch with me?

AUDR EY: jerry, these are for tomorrow. 
JERRY: the company wants me to get started right away.
AUDREY: i can't just pick up and move to boston with two days notice.
JERRY: ju st come check it out. you a nd max, see the town. let's . pick out a place together. then, if you want to turn me down and scar me for life, fine.
AUDREY: it's just not that simple... what about my job? i've been at ucla three years.
JERRY: it's new england. they're lousy with colleges. you can't swing a bat back there without hitting a college.
JERRY: you'd get a job there in a second.
AUDREY: there are other factors involved.
AUDREY: t here they are now. â·.
AUDREY: did you have fun? how were the wrestling matches?
FLETCHER: big fun. manly fun. am i right, maxie?
MAX: it was fun..

FLETCHER: so how were the wrestling matches ? did you have fun? 
JERRY: max , my man! my happy birthday man!
JERRY: one-two-three-four-five... and one for good luck.
FLETCHER: did you see that? he struck the child!
MAX: look what dad got me!
JERRY: whoa! great! i have my glove in the car. we'll stop in the park on the way home and play c atch. then tonight we'll oil
JERRY: it, wrap a rubber band around it. . . it'll be great. great birthday present, dad!
AUDREY: some thing's come up. we need to talk.
MAX: mom, let's go. i want to play.
AUDREY: we'll talk tonight.

FLETCHER: tonight? 
AUDREY: max's birthday?
FLETCHER': oh , yeah, right. seven. i knew that. i did. i blocked it out weeks ago. the se ven tee nt h of may. max's birthday.
AUDREY: it's the eighteenth.
FLETCHER: the seventeenth of may is the day i .remind myself that the eighteenth is max's birthday. see you tonight.

VIRGINIA: this is good. this is really smart. 
FLETCHER: thank you.
VIRGINIA: only i t ' s . . . like not true. every word of it is a lie.
VIRGINIA: i mean... isn't that a problem?
FLETCHER: mrs. cole, the only problem here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support, of raising his children -- they are his?
VIRGINIA: h m ? oh yeah. one for sure.
FLETCHER: after all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of

VIRGINIA: seven. 
FLETCHER: hm?

VIRGINIA: seven single acts of indiscretion. 
FLETCHER: --seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for.
VIRGINIA: he is?

FLETCHER: mrs. cole, i stayed up all night last night studying your c ase. not just your case... b ut you. and, by now, i feel i know you. you are the victim here. the wife of a cold, distant businessman. starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man-- 
VIRGINIA: seven.
FLETCHER: not missing a
BEAT): --seven .other men. you're not trying to deny him what is r ig htf ull y his. all you're insisting on is what is r ig htf ull y yours. and maybe an idgy-smidgy bit more. i think you're bending over backwards.
VIRGINIA: well, i did agree to give him j oint custody of the kids... he's always been a good father.
FLETCHER: and you've always been a good wife.
VIRGINIA: getting worked
UP): yeah. . .
FLETCHER: there's such a thing as being t oo nice. that's why you need aggr essive representation. to show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory. all i'm asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf. will you give me that opportunity?
FLETCHER: he stares into her eyes. a moment, then...
VIRGINIA: yes! i ' m tired of getting kicked around.
FLETCHER: good for you!
VIRGINIA: thank you, mr. reid. i ' m so grateful i have an attorney i can trust.
MIRANDA: you're good. you're really good.
FLETCHER: oh, pshaw. she picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.
MIRANDA: n o, i mean it. the cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm, not to mention the press it's going to g en er at e . you win this case and i guarantee you'll make partner.
MIRANDA: actually, how would you like to make a partner right now?
FLETCHER: excuse me?

AUDREY: indicating the 
CLOWN): what do you think?
JERRY: well, if you don't hire your brother, who will?

JERRY: they called me again from b oston. they really want me there tomorrow. 
AUDREY: . . . i can't go to boston.
JERRY: how come?
AUDREY: max.
JERRY: he'll love it there.
AUDREY: it's fletcher.
JERRY: fletcher?
AUDREY: i can't move max three thousand miles away from his father.

JERRY: audrey, i have never said a bad word about your ex -- 
AUDREY: i know.

JERRY: but how much responsibility does fletcher take for max, now? he'd never come over if you didn't remind him. 
AUDREY: i know. but if they're three thousand miles apart they'll never see each other. fletcher will never come to boston and how can i send max cross-country to him?
.JERRY: so because your ex-husband is unreliable, we can't-'-
AUDREY: i know, it's not logical, it's emotional. i'm sorry.
JERRY: i still want to marry you.
AUDREY: are you sure?
JERRY: mr. crisitelli, jerry she!ton... i hope i'm not calling too late... mr. crisitelli, i'm afraid i have to turn down your offer..'. so am i . . . well, i've fallen in love with this beautiful woman in l.a. and she doesn't want to leave and i won't leave without her... well, thank you very much... yes, good-bye.
JERRY: he wasn't there, but that's 1 the speech i would've made. she smiles and kisses him. the phone rings. audrey answers.
AUDREY: hello...

A UDREY: fletcher, where are you? we're getting ready to cut the cake. 
FLETCHER: urn, actually, something has come up. a problem on a new caaa-- .
F LET CHE R: a-h-h-h-!

AUDREY: what happened? 
FLETCHER: nothing. i just nailed my â·knee into the desk... listen, i'm really sorry i can't 'make it.
AUDREY: max is going to be so disappointed.
FLETCHER: i'll make it up to him, i promise. i'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?
AUDREY: do you want me to put him on the phone?
FLETCHER: ah, no. i have to go.

AUDREY: all right, birthday boy, make a wish. 
AUDREY: c'mon, honey. it can be anything-- whatever you want most in the world.
AUDREY: max, your dad is sorry. he had to work.
MAX: he said he was coming. he promised.
AUDREY: yes, well, he... promises he'll see you tomorrow.
MAX: i wish, for just one day, dad couldn't tell a lie.

MIRANDA: s o . . . was it good for you? 
FLETCHER: i've had better.

FLETCHER: new in the building? 
MODEL: i just moved in monday.
FLETCHER: ah. well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour.

BEGGAR: any change, mister? 
.FLETCHER: absolutely.
BEGGAR: could you spare some?

FLETCHER: unquestionably. 
BEGGAR: will you?
FLETCHER: no.
BEGGAR: how come?
FLETCHER: because i resent your p re sen ce. you fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. further, i don't believe you'll use the money for food, but i believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. also, i'm cheap.
BEGGAR: jerkoff.

VIRGINIA: you look like you're having a rough morning. 
FLETCHER: i've had better.
DANA: good morning, fletcher.
FLETCHER: dana. "

RICHARD: all right, virginia, how much will it take to put an end to this? 
FLETCHER: fifty per cent of your estate.
DANA: fifty per cent? with a pre- nup and proof of adultery?
FLETCHER: our case is simply this. . .
FLETCHER   ..: wa it! wait! i've got it in writing!
DANA: let go!
FLETCHER: i'm trying!

JUDGE STEVENS: calling case ba 09395, richard cole versus virginia cole. how're we doing this morning, counsel? 
DANA: fine, thank you.
JUDGE STEVENS: and you, mr. reid?
FLETCHER: well, i'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode i had last night--
JUDGE STEVENS: well, you're still young. it'll happen more and more. in the meantime, what do you say we get. down to business? first, mr. reid, i see that your client was previously represented by mr. rand of your office.
FLETCHER: yes, your honor.
JUDGE STEVENS: i take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?
FLETCHER: yes, your honor.
JUDGE STEVENS: fine , fine. and for the record, the reason is?

FLETCHER: mr. rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. 
JUDGE STEVENS: i take it you don't share the same ethical objections, mr.
FLETCHER: i have lower standards, your honor.
JUDGE STEVENS: i see. well, if mrs. cole wants the substitution of counsel, i'll allow it. is that what you want, mrs. cole?
VIRGINIA: yes?
JUDGE STEVENS: fine.
VIRGINIA: aside, to
FLETCHER): what are you doing?

FLETCHER: i realize that, your honor, but i ' d really, really, really like a continuance. 
JUDGE STEVENS: i'll have to hear good cause, counselor. what's the problem?

FLETCHER: i can't lie! 
JUDGE STEVENS: commendable, mr. reid, but i'm still waiting for the good caus e. now, do you have it or . not?

JUDGE STEVENS: motion for a continuance denied. is there any chance of a settlement in this case? 
DANA: i don't think so, your honor. mr. reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to --

DANA: your honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if mrs. cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. we have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband. 
JUDGE STEVENS: sounds pretty damning, mr.
FLETCHER: it certainly does.
DANA: however, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars.
JUDGE STEVENS: two four seems like a pretty fair offer, mr. reid.
FLETCHER: fantastically fair. phenominally fair. in fact, i'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid.
JUDGE STEVENS: what are you suggesting, mr. rei d? that ms. appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?
FLETCHER: no, not at all. she's got my client dead to rights. when
FLETCHER: attorneys go to sleep at night, they dream of having a case as strong as hers.
DANA: can the sarcasm, reid. all right, i admit it -- i've seen you make even the lamest case fly. but this time i have you. even clarence darrow couldn't explain this away.
JUDGE SAMIOAN: wel l, mr. reid? without a dynamite explanation, i'd say you're dead in the water.
FLETCHER: the best that money can buy, y o u r honor. â·
JUDGE STEVENS: strong corroborating evidence?
FLETCHER: we have evidence that you are not going to-believe.
JUDGE STEVENS: you're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, mr. reid?
FLETCHER: . "confident" is too weak a word, your honor. i am certain what will happen if i take this puppy to trial. the verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees.

DANA: all right! double the offer! four point eight! and not a penny more. 
FLETCHER): bastard!
JUDGE STEVENS: you are some negotiator, mr. reid. if your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer.

VIRGINIA: no! 
VIRGINIA: we are --

FLETCHER: no? ! mrs. cole, this offer was a miracle. i'm talking about a walking-on-water, lazarus-rising-from-the-dead, 
WATCH): four minutes. think of it this way -- now you're getting paid seven hundred thou per schtupp!

VIRGINIA: mr. reid, you convinced me yesterday -- i'm the victim here, starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man-- 
FLETCHER: seven! â·

VIRGINIA: -- seven other men. with the story you came up with, i don't think i can lose. i want to proceed. 
FLETCHER: mrs. cole, you don't â·. understand, i--
JUDGE STEVENS: well , mr. reid. do we have a settlement?
JUDGE STEVENS: th ere' s no settlement. trial to start at one-thirty sharp.

JANE: what do you think? 
FLETCHER .: i think you need help.
THOMAS: what's shakin', fletcher?
FLETCHER: your cellulite, tubster.
FRED: hiy a, fletcher. how's the cole case going?

FL ET CH ER: a test. . . something small... aha! 
FLETCHER: red. red. all right. focus,
FLETCHER: the color of this pen is â· r--. r--. r--! the color of this pen is--blue! aaaahh!
HEAD): ahhhh! one' tiny lie and i can't say it!!
HEAD): suddenly sitting
UP): ' i'll write.it!

GRETA: boss, what's wrong? 
FLETCHER: . the pen is blue!! the pen is .

FLETCHER: oh, that's easy for you to say?! 
GRETA: are you all right?
FLETCHER: i have to go home.
GRETA: home? was the case settled?
FLETCHER: no. i have to be in court at one-thirty.

GRETA: well, then how can you.go home? 
FLETCHER: i don't know, i don't know!!!
GRETA: okay.
EGGSHELLS): before i forget -- rubin and dun n called. they want to know where the darvis settlement offer stands.
FLETCHER: i only proposed a settlement t o with them. i never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it. .
GRETA: 'â·...dick with them." okay. your accountant, philip, called to remind you about getting together. .
FLETCHER: i'd rather shave my and sit in vinegar..
GRETA: jotting down a
NOTE): got it. and your mother called again. are you still on vacation?

GRETA: i ' m having a little trouble following you. what do i say to your mom? 
FLETCHER: tell her i'm a thoughtless son who'd rather spend ten hours clogging the wheels of justice than five minutes talking to her-- but only if she asks. you.might also add that she deserves better, though i hope to you don't.
GRETA: thanks for clearing that up. and that's it, except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son.

AUDREY': hey, fletcher. t was wondering if you were going to still pick up max after school today. 
FLETCHER: i don't think i can. i had a case i was certain would settle and it didn't. i have to go to trial this afternoon, help me.

AUDREY: not believing 
HIM): right.
FLETCHER: it's true... i really do want to see max, today.
FLETCHER: how about that. i really do.
AUDREY: but things keep coming up at the last minute.
FLETCHER: yes, but-this time it's different.
AUDREY: i see. and how is that?

FLETCHER: he walked into 
IT): this time i'm telling the truth.
AUDREY: but last night you weren't?
FLETCHER: no.
AUDREY: what were you doing?
FLETCHER: having sex.
AUDREY: , it must have been with someone very "special."
FLETCHER: no. it was with someone i don't even like. but i thought it would help my career and at the moment that
FLETCHER: seemed more important than attending my son's birthday!
A U D R EY: m y

MAX: is dad picking me up? 
AUDREY: no, i'm sorry, max. he can't make it. i will. i'll work it out.
MAX: i guess my wish didn't come â· true.
AUDREY: what wish?
MAX: i wished that, for just one day, dad couldn't tell a lie.
FLETCHER: answer, answer, answer...

AUDREY: hello. 
FLETCHER: audrey, let me explain.
AUDREY: fletcher, something else is about to happen to you.
FLETCHER.: what do you mean?
AUDREY: max and i are moving to boston.
FLETCHER: what?!
AUDREY: jerry asked me to marry him. he wants max and i to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. and i'm going to go. knows i don't have any reason to stay here.
FLETCHER: . wait, you can't move! if you take max away... i'll practically never see him.
AUDREY: well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now.
FLETCHER: audrey, please.... is this because of what i just said on the phone?
AUDREY: that was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye.
FLETCHER: where are you?
AUDREY: heading home.

FLETCHER: aaaah! 
MIRANDA: flet cher. fletcher, fletcher, fletcher. i must confess-- after last night's incident, i was. . . hurt. so hurt. i was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your chances of making partner.
MIRANDA: but then i thought, "no, that 's not fair. fletcher didn't mean to insult me."
MIRANDA: "it was just some massive, boneheaded misunderstanding, and fletcher is very, very sorry."
MIRANDA: isn't that right, fletcher?
FLETCHER: uh -- not really, no.
MIRANDA: n o ? no?! what are you sayi ng? have you no respect for me?!

FLETCHER: none, whatsoever. i mean, i ' d like to respect you, and if it weren't for your mistreatment of the associates, your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work i would. 
M IRANDA: but -- what about last night?
FLETCHER: i was afraid you wouldn't support my partnership if i turned you down. plus, i have an immature need for sexual conquests.

FLETCHER: gotta focus. . . gotta focus. 
FLETCHER: the color of the pen is -- re d ! .
DRIVER: what's your problem, schmuck?!
FLETCHER: i ' m an inconsiderate prick!
FLETCHER: fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.
FLETCHER: c'mon, you can do this! the color of the pen is -- red!
FLETC HER: s hi t !!
FLETC HER: fletcher pulls over. a police officer strolls up.
POLICE OFFICER: do you know why i stopped you?
FLETCHER: depends on how long you were following me.
POLICE OFFICER: why don't we take it from the top.
FLETCHER: â· here goes -- i didn't fasten my seatbelt, i didn't glance in my rearview mirror, i didn't signal when i pulled away from the curb, i sped, i followed too closely, i ran a stop sign, i almost hit :a chevy camaro, i almost hit a ge ezer, i sped some more, i failed to yield at a crosswalk, i changed lanes in the intersection, i changed lanes without signalling, and i changed lanes in the
INTERSECTION-WITHOUT: signalling while running a red light and speeding.
POLICE OFFICER: may i see your driver's license?
FLETCHER: no.

POLICE OFFICER: and why is that? 
FLETCHER: it's in my other pants.
POLICE OFFICER: i see. and where are your â· other pants?
FLETCHER: hanging from my boss's credenza.
POLICE OFFICER: do you expect me to believe that?
FLETCHER: no.

POLICE OFFICER: do you think i'm an idiot? 
FLETCHER: yes -- but that's beside the point! my license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaj i wouldn't lie to you! i mean, i would if i could, but i can't!
POLICE OFFICER: i see. so you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me?
FLETCHER: i didn't say that. i have other reasons. seventeen reasons, to be precise. unpaid parking tickets.
FLETCHER: be gentle.

FLETCHER: audrey, wait! 
AUDREY: wait? you know, i just had an insight into myself. i ' m crazy. you call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- i actually wait.
FLETCHER: i can explain--
AUDREY: i missed a department meeting.
FLETCHER: yes.
AUDREY: where's your car?

FLETCHER: thank you. . i can't tell you how much this means to me. 
AUDREY: i can. one thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents.
FLETCHER: ow.

FLETCHER: you scratched my car! 
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE: where? .
FLETCHER: right there!

TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE: oh that? that was already there. 
FLETCHER: why, you -- you liar! do you know what i ' m going to do about this?
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE: what?
FLETCHER: angrier and
ANGRIER): ...nothing! because if i take you to small-claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if i finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what i'm gonna do is and moan like an impotent jerk and . then bend over and take it up the tail pipe!
TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE: you've been here before, haven't you?
AUDREY: well i can't remember when i've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, i have a class.
FLETCHER: audrey, wait. i want to talk to you about this boston situation.
. AUDREY: what do you want to say?
FLETCHER: you can't go. it's not fair. taking max three thousand miles away is not fair.

AUDREY: let' s define "fair." last â· night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. fair? 
FLETCHER: last night--
AUDREY: -- was none of my business. when it happened two years ago it was my business, but now i don't have to care anymore. see, that's the magic of div orce . but it does matter to max. everything you do matters to him... and everything you don't do.
FLETCHER: all right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. i'm guilty of all charges. i'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court.
FLETCHER {CONT'D): i have an idea. i'll come over tonight, right after court lets out and play with m ax. have him invite some fri ends over. we'll have a game and everything. then, you and i can sit down and talk.
AUDREY: we're suppose to be on a plane

FLETCHER: no, audrey. just talk to me abou t this first. please. au drey, i've lost you. don't make me lose max, too. 
AUDREY: you're really coming?

FLETCHER: this is iron-clad. this is the mother of all promises. 
AUDREY: ...six?
FLETCHER: ten-to-six.

FLETCHER.: i will be there. 
FLETCHER.: as audrey gets in her car -- .
AUDREY: i hope so. do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? he was making a wish on his birthday c ake. he was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie.
FLETCHER: oh my that-'s it! an innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! if he can wish it, he can unwish it!

MS . BERRY: are you max's dad? i ' m ms. 
FLETCHER: hi. listen, i need to talk to

MS. BERRY: mr. reid, we were just talking ab ou t careers. you're a lawyer, aren't you? 
FLETCHER: yes.
MAX: mr. reid it'would be wonderful for the children to hear something positive about lawyers!
FLETCHER: well, actually-- â·
MS. BERRY: children! .mr. reid is going to tell us what it's like to be a lawyer.
FLETCHER: uh, hi. uh, i'm a lawyer and i work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and i do stuff in a law court. thank you.
MS. BERRY: one moment, mr. reid. maybe some of the children have
QUESTIONS: jeffrey?

JEFF: what kind of lawyer are you? 
FLETCHER: mostly, i ' m a divorce lawyer.
BILLY: what's that?
FLETCHER: it means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me.
CRAIG: so what do you do?
FLETCHER: i help people fight over their money and their children.
THEODORE: can't they fight without you?
FLETCHER ' ": they could but then j wouldn't make a living.
JILL: why would my daddy leave my mommy?
FLETCHER: to marry a younger woman. to escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. to cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death.
MS. BERRY: well, i think it's time for fingerpainting.

MAX: dadzilla. you came to play catch? 
FLETCHER: no. i ' d like to, but i can't right now.
FLETCHER: i ' m sorry i missed your party la st night. how was your uncle glen?
MAX: stupid. his big nose and stupid orange hair...
FLETCHER: that's why he should have worn make-up.
FLETCHER: yeah, okay, urn... your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. it came true.
MAX: really? you mean you have to tell the truth?
FLETCHER: yes.

MAX: no matter what? 
FLETCHER: no matter what.

MAX: is wrestling real? 
FLETCHER: in the olympics, yes. on .
MAX: will sitting close to the tv set make me go blind?
FLETCHER: not in a million years.
MAX: if i keep making this face--
MAX: will it get stuck that way?
FLETCHER: uh-uh.
MAX: .if i go in the water right after lunch, will i drown?
FLETCHER: only if you can't 'swim.
MAX: why do i have to eat squash?
FLETCHER: because your mom buys it.
MAX: how come you're always too busy to play with me?
FLETCHER: i . . . i don't know. i ' m . . . hey, you know i'm coming over to nig ht. we're gonna play together.
MAX: baseball?

FLETCHER: . yes! this is absolutely an a-number one promise. you and i -- tonight -- baseball. 
FLETCHER: now, listen, max, i need a favor from you. i ' m in a little trouble today. i need you to take that wish back.
MAX: so you can lie?
FLETCHER: not to you.
MAX: to who?
FLETCHER: max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. it's hard to explain, but i . . . look, here's an example. when mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. se venty pounds. i thought she was gonna give birth to a car. but she'd say to me "how do i lo ok?" so i'd say, "oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 otherwise, i would've hurt mommy's fee ling s. understand?
MAX: you didn't think she was beautiful.
FLETCHER: right. no... max, i don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if i have to stick to the truth. i could lose my case, i could lose my promotion, i could even lose, my job... do you understand?
FLETCHER: will you help me anyway?
FLETCHER: that's my boy!
FLETCHER: now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un-wish.
MAX: i did it. ^
FLETCHER: great! great! now to test --

SLAPS HIM.: fletcher returns to his son. 
MAX: did it work?
CHEEK): not like i ' d hoped. did you really unwish it?
MAX: only...
FLETCHER: only what?
MAX: yesterday, when i wished it, i r ea lly meant it. this time when i unwished it i only did it 'cause you told me to.

FLETCHER: well, then do it again. only this time, mean it. 
MAX: i can't.
FLETCHER: why not?!
MAX: because i don't want you to lie.
FLETCHER: i explained this to you! i have to lie. everybody lies! mommy lies, even the wonderful jerry lies--

MAX: but you're the only one who makes me feel bad. 
MS. BERRY: max, recess 'is over, come on in.
MAX: i have to go.
FLETCHER: i am coming over, tonight, max. you believe me, don't you?
FLETCHER: i'll see you tonight, buddy... that's a promise.

MACHO ATTORNEY: yo, fletcher! how's it hanging? 
FLETCHER: short and shrivelled.
PHILIP: fletcher! i'm still waiting for your call. i guess you must've lost my card --
FLETCHER: no --
PHILIP: or my phone was busy --
FLETCHER: no --

PHILIP: or you just forgot -- 
FLETCHER: no --
PHILIP: cannot be
DISCOURAGED): or something. so anyway,' why don't you swing by my place around seven-thirty!
FLETCHER: philip... i don't want to come over to your house!

FLETCHER: no.

GRETA: are you okay? 
FLETCHER: my son hates me.
GRETA: no! he loves you. i've seen y ou together. you're his hero.
FLETCHER: o h yeah? last night at his birthday party, he made a â·wish. that i wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day.
GRETA: kids...
FLETCHER: it came true.
GRETA: what?
FLETCHER: it's true. didn't it seem odd to you that i kept telling the truth all morning?
GRETA: well, yeah, but...
GRETA: you're telling me that you can't lie.
FLETCHER: that's right! i am incapable of lying.

GRETA: just today? 
FLETCHER: apparently until 9:15 tonight.
GRETA: yes, those are going around.
FLETCHER: you don't believe me.
GRETA: of course not.
FLETCHER: go ahead. ask me something i ' d normally lie about.
GRETA: a ll right. remember a few months ago, i wanted a raise--
FLETCHER: forget it. let's not do this.
GRETA: -- and the firm wouldn't.give me one. and i asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company wouldn't permit it because it creates jealousy among the other secretaries? was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough?

FLETCHER: greta, please... yes judge stevens, hi!.. fletcher reid. i ' m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour... judge stevens, i badly, badly need a continuance. . . so i can go home and stay there the rest of the day...111? am i ill? 
FLETCHER: in a way.
MOUTHPIECE): please, lie to him for me.

FLETCHER: but if you could just do this for me, i-- the phone won't stop ringing. .â·'

FLETCHER: oh i cut him off! i cut off the judge! greta... 
FLETCHER: i'm on my knees in a nine hundred dollar suit. don't leave.
GRETA: a few years ago a friend of mine had a burglar up on her roof.
FLETCHER: yes?
FLETCHER: no. . . but what' s your poijit!
GRETA: my point is, it's hard to get justice. but this is justice,
GRETA: have a nice day in court, bubbie. she leaves. fletcher starts to give chase...

FLETCHER: aaaah! 
MIRANDA: ah, fletcher, so nice to bump i nto you. are you busy?
FLETCHER: extremely.
MIRANDA: good. would you follow me, please?
MIRANDA: fletcher, did you know that the partnership committee is being headed up by mr. allan himself?
NOD): say, you used to work directly for mr. allan, didn't you?
NOD): tell me, what do you think of him?

FLETCHER: he's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. 
MIRANDA: how delightful!

MR. ALLAN: â·it's good to see you again, fletcher. '. 
MIRANDA: oh, that's right. you used to work together. .tell me, what do you think of mr. allah?
MIRANDA: i said... what do you think of mr. allan?
FLETCHER     .: he's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung.

MR. ALLAN: marvelous! marvelous! that's what i love most about this firm-- the collegial atmosphere, the hearty good- fellowship!

NOTES): -- from march six through june twelve, i surveilled mrs. cole at the behest of mr. cole. during that period, i noted that mr. cole left each day between seven-forty and seven- fifty. thereafter, mrs. cole would frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay for one to four hours. i was able to take several photographs of the male visitor.

DANA: i see. and do you .know what mrs. cole and her male visitor 
DANA: did during their frequent...
BRYSON: well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn -- but i sure was able to hear. i made an audiotape of one such., "session."
DANA: with the court's permission, i would like to play the tape.
FLETCHER: your honor, i object!
JUDGE STEVENS: and why is that, mr. reid?
FLETCHER: can't help
HIMSELF): because it's devastating to my â·case.

JUDGE STEVENS: it can't wait?
FLETCHER: not unless you want to mop up.
JUDGE STEVENS: all right, but get back in here immediately so .we can finish this.

FLETCHER: what did i think? that i could for forty-five minutes?! 
MAN: what's going on in-there?
MAN: i ' m abusing myself! do you mind?!

BAILIFF: i found him like this in the bathroom. somebody beat the out of him. 
JUDGE STEVENS: who did this?

JUDGE STEVENS: -what did he look like?

JUDGE STEVENS: bailiff, have the deputies search the building. 
JUDGE STEVENS: under the circumstances, i have no choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine.

FALK: how are you?
FLETCHER: i've slipped into the seventh circle of hell, thank you, and you?
VIRGINIA: shouldn't we go over our testimony?
FLETCHER: well, basically the plan is i walk you through the tape step by step, i ask you questions--
VIRGINIA: and we give the explanation you came up with.

FALK: so all we have to do is lie. 
FLETCHER: do esn't it? and i'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... "mr. falk, isn't it true that you and mrs. cole have never made lo--"
FLETHCER: sorry. i'm fine. "mr. falk, isn't it true that you and mrs. cole have never made lo--

FLETCHER: oh my i can't do it! i can't finish the question if i know the answer is a lie!

FLETCHER: if i might rephrase your honor. is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not?
X\: is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic? is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?
X\: mr. falk, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?
FALK: no. i mean, yes. i think.

JUDGE STEVENS: mr. reid?
VIRGINIA: call me, it!

FLETCHER: thirty-one?
JUDGE STEVENS: mr. reid, we're not getting any younger...
JUDGE STEVENS: mr. reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such i have no choice but to rule in favor of --

MR. ALLAN: what the is he doing? 
MIRANDA: kissing his career goodbye.
BALIFP: do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you god?
VIRGINIA: i do.
FLETCHER: mrs. cole -- may i call you virginia?
VIRGINIA: yes.
FLETCHER: but that would be a lie, wouldn't it?
VIRGINIA: what do you mean?
FLETCHER: isn't your true name...

VIRGINIA: well, yes. but it wasn't me so i started using virginia. is there anything wrong with that? 
F LETCHER: your driver's license. what color are your eyes?
VIRGINIA: blue.
FLETCHER: tru e blue? what if i asked you to remove your contact l enses? what color would they be then?
VIRGINIA: brown.
FLETCHER: and here it says you're a b l on de . are you? c'mon, carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. if you don't remember, perhaps mr. falk will.
VIRGINIA: brunette.
FLETCH ER: more like a dirty brown, isn't it? let's see - . - " weight: one-o- five"? please...
VIRGINIA .: one-eighteen.
VIRGINIA .: one-twenty-six. i swear!
FLETCHER: so on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. i'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. it says you were born in 1964. what's the truth? 1962? '60? how young did you try to make yourself?
VIRGINIA: wrong! i didn't lie to make myself younger. i made myself older. i was born in 1965!"

VIRGINIA: yes! " lied so i could get married! so .there mister 'i 
JUDGE STEVENS: mr. reid, does this have a point?
FLETCHER: oh, you bet it does, your honor! my client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. which makes h er a minor. and in the great state of california, no minor

DANA: defeated, to 
HERSELF): prenuptual agreements.

PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK: you very little! this contract is void!!! the fact that my client gets nailed â· more often than a two-by-four is irrelevant. standard community property applies and this woman is entitled to half of the marital assets or thirty-seven point three-nine- five million dollars!! yo . . . . a e . . . . t a t t t ! ! 
PRENUPTUAL AGREEMENTS! THANK: nothing further, your honor!

JUDGE STEVENS: banging his

JUDGE STEVENS: in light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o the defense. mrs. cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars.
MR. ALLAN: that son of pulled it off!
JUDGE STEVENS: o r d e r ! order!! now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. is that correct?

VIRGINIA: no! i'm contesting custody. 
VIRGINIA: fletcher freezes.
FLETCHER: what?
VIRGINIA: payback. for him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million.
FLETCHER: he was entitled to prevent you. you committed adultery.' you only won because you're a liar, remember? .
VIRGINIA: no. you pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. i was the vic tim here. and now i'm going to hit him where it hurts.
FLETCHER: but -- but -- you said he was a good father.
JUDGE STEVENS: m r. reid? do we have an agreement on custody or not?
FLETCHER: no. .
JUDGE STEVENS: in that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine. court is adj ourned!

VIRGINIA: stop that! we're leaving now! 
CHILD: i want to go with daddy.

MR. COLE: don't worry. i'll see you no matter what. i promise. 
MR. ALLAN: re: the

FLETCHER ': excuse me. just a second. y our honor? your honor?
JUDGE STEVENS: we',re adjourned, mr. reid.
FLETCHER: screw that!! she lies and she wins ?! what are we, nuts?
FLETCHER: t his woman --my client -- goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar! and now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too?

JUDGE STEVENS: that's enough, mr. reid -- 
FLETCHER: -let' s see what i' ve done today. i've helped a gold digging get richer. i'm taking this guy's kids away. i don't like you in the least, now i'm one of your partners!

GREAT 1 I: fletcher does feel strangely fantastic. free, 
JUDGE STEVENS: that's it, mr..reid. i find you in contempt!

JUDGE STEVENS: bailiff! remove mr. reid from the courtroom!

AUDREY: you can come visit anytime.
FLETCHER: i don't want to visit him. that's what i've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. i want to be in his life. i don't want to be some jerk that sees him at easter. i want to be his father.
FLETCHER: i know i have no right to ask, but can i talk you out of taki ng that job? i can get you a better job here in l.a. i've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again?
JERRY: i design security systems.

JERRY: it's okay.
JERRY: to me. all i want is for this lady and max to be happy. preferably, with me. whatever they want, i'll go along with.
AUDREY: all i want is for max to be happy.
AUDREY: you better know your jury. you're hot exactly max's hero today.
FLETCHER: just let me present my case.

FLETCHER/TERMINATOR: i have been sent from the future to destroy you. . . argghhh! 
BEAT): you mad at me?
FLETCHER: you wanted me to stop lying. but lying isn't the problem. .. why we lie ~ that's the problem. sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. but sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way... but being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more
FLETCHER: important things. much more important things. i was so stupid, max. malfunction in vector one. all this time you've been here and i could see you anytime i felt like it. and i... didn't. please don't go to boston. max, i love you more than anything else in the world and you know it's true. i couldn't say it if it weren't true. not today.
MAX: he's telling the truth, mom. he's not allowed to lie. i made a wish and anything dad says has to be the truth. .. right?
FLETCHER: max. .. it's 9:22.
AUDREY: what?
FLETCHER: max, you made the wish at 9:15. i've been able to lie for the last seven minutes.
MAX: so then, you were...
FLETCHER: no! it wasn't a lie. i just wanted to be honest with you and tell you -- there was no wish to guarantee it anymore. you just have to believe me.

MAX: mommy... do we have to go to boston? 
AUDR EY: no. we don't have to.

FLETCHER: so, you up for a little friendly competition?
JERRY: no, you go play with your son.
