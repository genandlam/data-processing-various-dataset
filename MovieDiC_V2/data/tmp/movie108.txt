BRUCE: oh, no! the hair's wrong. this is a bad sign. we really need to get a make-up person?! the segment producer, ally loman, steps over. 
ALLY: not in the budget. and not to
ALLY: worry, you're going to look great in this.
BRUCE: a hair net? i'm not wearing a hair net. i just did the hair.
ALLY: health code. in the kitchen or around the cookie, you gotta have it.
BRUCE: you guy's should tell me this before hand, this is like a huge waste of...moose.
BRUCE: remind me to swing by an elementary school after this and serve lunch.

ALLY: you're a thing of beauty. in three, two, one. . . 
BRUCE: for three decades the kowolski family bakery has been a mainstay in downtown buffalo. known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. and the occasional sugar induced coma that follows. today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, momma kowolski and her sons gustov and vol, decided to do something, a little bit different. tell me guys, how did this idea come about?
GUSTOV: well, vol said to me, 'gustov, why don't we make the biggest chocolate chip cookie in buffalo?' and i said, 'yeah, sure.'
BRUCE: wow. fascinating.
BRUCE: the previous buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by gladys pelsnick. but this behemoth cookie clearly proving that gustov and vol have much more free time.
BRUCE: as we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think. what are we really looking at here?

BRUCE: is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of buffalo? our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient, with a few nuts thrown in. and finally, the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved buffalo the sweetest place to live. 
BRUCE: and that's the way the cookie crumbles. i'm bruce nolan, eyewitness news.

BRUCE: so, what do you think? 
GRACE: it's good.
BRUCE: it it's a story about a cookie. people with eating disorders will be riveted, dear bruce, love the bakery piece. i can't wait to vomit so i can make room for more cookies.
GRACE: i thought it was funny. i love the hair net. how'd you get it to do that?

BRUCE: what? i'm cutting that. they made me wear that stupid thing. i don't even look like myself. the hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona. right out of the gate, i lost the hair advantage. 
GRACE: oh, my gosh, look at this one. my sister is so drunk.
BRUCE: grace. try to stay focused here.
GRACE: aren't you taking this a little too seriously?
BRUCE: it's sweeps grace. it is serious. there's an anchor job open. this is important. this is our future!
GRACE: i'm sorry.
BRUCE: i'm never going to get anchor doing these kind of assignments. i want my work to matter.
GRACE: it does matter. you're funny. you make people smile. come on, take a break, help me put this album together.

BRUCE: alright. 
GRACE: oh look at this. it's the first day we moved in together.
BRUCE: yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
GRACE: oh, here's me at my sister's wedding. i caught the bouquet.
BRUCE: you look pretty intense, hun.
GRACE: well, i was thinking about you.
BRUCE: so, you're attracted to me in some way, is that what you're trying to say?
GRACE: you have no idea.
BRUCE: i was saving myself for the wedding night, but if you keep this up, i may lose my resolve.
GRACE: well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

BRUCE: hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance. from the diaphragm. that's the way the cookie crumbles. 
GRACE: oh, say it again.
BRUCE: that's the way the cookie crumbles.
GRACE: oh, i just love on-air personalities.
BRUCE: well then, let me take these clothes off and slip into my hair net.

A TELEVISION SCREEN: we see the intro for sixty minutes:

GRACE: oh, that's a nice response.

BRUCE: i mean, it's just s o . . . 
GRACE: helpful and life saving?
BRUCE: c'mon, that's your...blood. it's in your body and i don't think it's supposed to come out. besides, they stockpile that stuff. they have an endless supply frozen in a warehouse somewhere then tell everyone there's a shortage.
GRACE: they do not. now stop it. i'm giving. i have a very rare blood type, ab positive.
BRUCE: well, i'm ib positive. ib positive they aint touchin' me with no needle.
O. . .: h
BRUCE: what's that?

BRUCE: really?
BOBBY: they must have gotten high or something, cause they was orderin' everything, i had. hey, how long have you been interested in pastry? 'cause i've got an aunt who makes baklava twenty layers deep.
BRUCE: bobby.
BOBBY: maybe you could do a story on her!
BRUCE: keep the change.
BOBBY: i'll give her a call, we'll talk about it later!

JACK: okay, promos are approved, let's-- 
ALLY: ah, isn't that last one a little misleading? i mean, the story's about flu shots. do we have to scare people to death?
EVAN: no, just into watching. or i could change it to: "slow news day, come yawn with us. at eleven."
FRED: sniffles at eleven is nice.
DALLAS: attack of the killer sniffles?
ALLY: the tanning booth is starting to zap your brain, you know that?
DALLAS: i don't use a tanning booth.
FRED: come on. you're turning orange.
EVAN: he looks florida ripe to me. . more laughs.

JACK: i would have swore i already said this, but promos are approved. now can we move on? 
ALLY: jack, shouldn't the promos be focusing on pete's retirement.
EVAN: yeah, yeah. any word on the open anchor position, jack?
JACK: evan, you'11 know something when i know something.
BRUCE: sorry, jack. it wasn't my fault. the traffic was -- you guys already played the spots?
JACK: nice story, bruce, but we're going with evan's piece on the scandal at the mayor's office for sweeps.
EVAN: and that's the way the cookie crumbles.
EVAN: i'm just messin' with you, bruce. see you've got to remember that the news room is like a cookie...
BRUCE: that's great evan.

15.: bruce is you're posture naturally that good, or do you have to shove a stick up there? 
JACK: okay, knock it off... bruce we're holding your story in reserve. now, can we get back to the board so we have something to air today?

BRUCE: jack, jack, hey. can i talk to you for a second? 
JACK: sure, bruce. what do you need?
BRUCE: sweeps.
BOBBY: don't worry about it. i called my aunt, we're on.
BRUCE: look, jack. hear me out, i'm getting desperate man, i am pushing forty and what have i got to show for it? the point is, i've hit some kind of a ceiling here. some kind of anti-bruce barrieri and evan is just lovin' it, by the way. he gets the good stories, he gets on sweeps. maybe i have to be more like evan.
JACK: you don't want to be like evan.
BRUCE: i can be an

JACK: no, bruce. you can't. 
JACK: are you going to pick that up?
BRUCE: yeah, i'm sorry.
BRUCE: it's just- this anchor position looming, it's gotten me nuts...

SUSAN: bruce nolan is standing by at niagara falls with a report on the maid of the mist sightseeing boat, but before we go live to bruce, we have an announcement to make. as everyone knows, after 33 years, our beloved pete fineman is retiring.
SUSAN: pete's shoes are virtually impossible to fill, but the show must go on. and we could think of no one better than our very own evan baxter.

SUSAN: congratulations, evan. looks like we'll be sitting side by side from now on. 
EVAN: thanks, susan. i ' m thrilled and honored. like you said, no one can replace the great pete fineman, but i'll do my best. i have to say i am so proud to be a part of our local community. of buffalo. i think a great city is a lot like a great recipe really. put in some hard working citizens, add some care givers, maybe a few nuts...

JACK: come on, bruce, talk damn-it...

BRUCE: first off, "i want to add another congratulations to evan baxter. it's good to see what someone with real talent can accomplish when great opportunities are given to him instead of me. anyway, i'm here, i believe with katherine hepburn's mom. tell me, why did you toss the blue "heart of the ocean" jewel over the railing of titanic? 
BRUCE: did you feel guilty at all letting leonardo decaprio freeze, while you were safe floating on the big door? do you think he would have survived if you had taken turns, or were you too afraid to freeze your big fat off?
JACK: did i just hear..?
BRUCE: well, i guess that's the way life works, isn't it? some people are drenched, freezing to death, on a stupid boat, with a stupid umbrella... while others who aren't fit to kiss my willy, are sitting in a nice, comfy news room, sucking up all the glory111

GRACE: this isn't happening. this isn't happening... 
BRUCE: now, lets speak to the owner. come on in here, bill.
BRUCE: bill, you.'ve been running the maid of the mist for 23 years. tell me, why do you think i didn't get the anchor job?
BILL: hey, man, i don't want any--
BRUCE: do you think it's my hair? maybe my teeth aren't white enough? or like the great falls, is the bedrock of my life slowly erroding underneath me. erroding. erroooding.

JACK: alright, cut the feed! cut to black if you have to. 
CONTROL BOOTH OPERATOR: i'm on it.

GRACE: bruce, don't talk like that.
BRUCE: oh, don't worry, he's not listening. if he is he doesn't care. have you seen the news lately? we got gangs, we got drugs, we got corruption. what kind of lets that happen? every time we cure a disease he comes up with a new one! yeah, is this the lab? yeah, it's they've just come up with a treatment for syphilis down there. i think it's time to release the tainted monkey. oh, and there's a guy in ohio who's praying for strength and wisdom, blind him and cut off his legs.
GRACE: so is torturing us?
BRUCE: think about it, grace. is all- powerful . he could fix everything in five minutes if he wanted to.

29.: bruce but he doesn't want to. he doesn't like me. 
BRUCE: oh, perfect! but you're aim isn't so good, i'm over herel
GRACE: bruce, please. this isn't his fault.
BRUCE: of course not. it's part of the mysterious plan.
GRACE: honey, you're mad right now. it's understandable. and what evan did was slimy and wrong. but your job doesn't matter to me. you matter to me. you could've really been hurt. i'm just glad you're okay.
BRUCE: okay? news flash: i'm not okayi and i'm not okay with the fact that you think everything is okay. i'm not okay with a mediocre job. i'm not okay with a mediocre apartment. i'm not okay with a mediocre life!
GRACE: is that what you have, bruce? a mediocre life? well, i'm sorry for being a piece in your mediocre puzzle.

38.: bruce everyone with a brain in their head would know that the drawer is being â· fed through the wall from behind-- bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a normal back. 
BRUCE: okay. that's good. that's a good one.

POLICEMAN: we got a bodyi
PHIL: get the camera, now!

BRUCE: since the disapearence of teamster president jimmy hoffa in the nineteen sixties, his whereabouts have remained one of this country's great unsolved mysteries. that is until just moments ago, when during a routine training session, a police dog named hank sniffed his way right into the history books. as you can see behind us, the body is being carefully exhumed and will be transported to a hospital facility where dna testing will confirm the identity. that, of course, only a formality as in a bizarre twist, the body was found buried with a birth certificate and complete set of dental records. sort of a two-in-one for hank today, as moments later, he busted a local news camera crew with four kilo's of marijuana.

BRUCE: if i could have just one thing in the world. it would be for grace to live a happy, joyful life. and that she finds someone... ...that she finds someone that will treat her with the love and respect that she so deserves.
GOD: now that is a prayer. well, i better get on that one. see ya, bruce.
NURSE: he's back!
INTERN: bp 40 over 110 and rising.
DOCTOR #1: - bruce? can you hear me? we almost lost you there.
DOCTOR #1: you lost a lot of blood. it wasn't easy to find a match - you're a very rare blood type.

BRUCE: a/b positive... 
DOCTOR #2: you should thank for donors. we don't have a lot of that type on hand.
NURSE: there's your angel now.

GRACE: i hear that all of this winds up in a warehouse somewhere. but you know me, i'm a sucker for this stuff. the doctors give grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving the two of them alone. grace tentatively approaches. 
GRACE: i don't even know what i'm doing here. but... when i heard that you'd been in an accident and that you might not make it. . .
BRUCE: hey, i'm okay.
GRACE: does it hurt?
BRUCE: only when i talk., and smile... and y'know, exist in general.

GRACE: oh my gosh, you still have those? 
GRACE: what is it?
BRUCE: nothing. it's just really nice to see you.

BOBBY: you know, french toast was invented by tavern owner, joseph french, who had a poor knowledge of grammar, and did not know how to use the possessive apostrophe, so he called it french toast instead of french's toast... 
BRUCE: this is bruce nolan at buffalo's first annual "be the miracle" blood drive. remember, the life you save may be mine, so hurry down. i had a close call and, well, can you imagine what life would have been like without me?

BRUCE: in honor of this event, the kowolski brothers have baked a one- of-a-kind, creation. 
BRUCE: sure, a little creepy and a shameless plug, but we love 'em. mmm, good needle. remember, that's kowolski's bakery. the bakery that gets more air time than a high speed chase. everyone laughs. the kowolski brothers beam.

BRUCE: no, this is nothing. in fact, this is the second time i've given blood this week. for those of you who haven't heard, i ' d like you to meet the soon to be mrs. exclusive. 
BRUCE: this is bruce nolan reporting for eyewitness news.
BRUCE: so, what'd you think?
GRACE: i don't know, i thought it was very pleasurable. bruce smiles, they kiss...
