BEN: hank!
HANK: -- table.
HANK: hey look - a camel!

JO: this isn't really africa, hank. it's french morocco. 
BEN: northern africa.
HANK: still seems like las vegas.
BEN: we're only a hundred miles north of the sahara desert!

HANK: i dunno. in school they called it the dark continent. it's twice as bright as indianapolis! 
BEN: just wait till you see marrakesh.
HANK: marrakesh. sounds like a drink.
BEN: you bet it does.

BEN: i'd like to thank you. without your help, anything might have happened. 
LOUIS: a pleasure, monsieur. there are moments in life when we all need a little help.
BEN: may i introduce my wife, mrs. mckenna.
LOUIS: how do you do, madame. my name is louis bernard.
JO: thank you, mr. bernard.
BEN: and this is our son, hank.
LOUIS: hallo, hank.
HANK: you talk arab talk.
LOUIS: a few words.
JO: why was he so angry? it was an accident.
LOUIS: the moslem religion allows for few accidents. may i be permitted to sit down?
BEN: oh, sure, sure. 0f course. next to jo, there.
LOUIS: i thought his name was hank.
BEN: oh, uh --

LOUIS: how different. 
BEN: for josephine. called her jo so long, nobody knows her by any other name.
HANK: i do. mummy.
LOUIS: now about the "accident." you see, a moslem woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances.
HANK: they feed her intervaneously?
LOUIS: quite a big word for such a small boy.
BEN: i'm a doctor.
LOUIS: oh. well, he sounds like one.
BEN: he can spell "haemoglobin" -- but he has trouble with "cat" and "dog."
LOUIS: and where do you practice, doctor?
BEN: indianapolis, indiana. the good samaritan.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 8.
LOUIS: what brings you to marrakesh?
BEN: we've been to a medical convention in paris. and while we were in europe, i thought i'd like to see morocco again.
HANK: daddy liberated africa.
BEN: i was up around casablanca with an army field hospital, that's all.

JO: do you live in morocco, mr. bernard? 
LOUIS: oh no. i suppose you came directly from paris?
BEN: we looked in on rome and lisbon a few days.
HANK: and casablanca.
LOUIS: i hope you will have time to truly enjoy marrakesh.
BEN: at the most we'll have three days.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 9.
LOUIS: you will naturally be stopping at the hotel mamounia or la menara?
JO: why?
LOUIS: they are hotels for tourists of good taste. the background, as seen through the windows of the bus, indicates that we are in a built-up area.

JO: do you live in france, mr. bernard? 
LOUIS: sometimes.
HANK: do you eat snails.
LOUIS: when i'm lucky enough to got them.
HANK: if you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails.
LOUIS: thank you for the invitation.
HANK: that's all right. we tried everything to got rid of them. we never thought of a frenchman.
HANK: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 10.

HANK: next time take the train. 
BEN: would you like to share our taxi to the hotel?
LOUIS: that's kind of you, doctor, but unfortunately i have some business first.
JO: what business are you in, mr. bernard?
LOUIS: however, i'll be there later - perhaps we might have a drink together.
LOUIS: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 11.
BEN: all right. but i'll serve the drinks in our suite.
LOUIS: in that case, i will take you to dinner.
BEN: no. now that's not a fair bargain.
LOUIS: but i know marrakesh. i can show you an intriguing arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner of eating exotic.
BEN: well -- that's what we came here for. okay, jo? simple one of those arabian nights?
JO: okay, but i'm no scheherazade.
BEN: you'll do.
LOUIS: how would you prefer to travel to the hotel? by taxi? fiacre?
HANK: a wagon! i want to ride in a wagon!
LOUIS: au revoir. i look forward to cocktails.
JO: goodbye.
BEN: see you later. and thinks again.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 12.
HANK: i don't like people who pat me on the head.
BEN: the carriage awaits, madame. jo turns from the retreating louis, and steers hank toward ben, the camera pans them to the fiacre.

J0: ben -- i just saw louis bernard talking to that arab. 
BEN: what arab?
JO: the one who was shouting at hank for taking the woman's veil. he and the frenchman were talking like old friends.
BEN: all right. let's assume they knew each other, and louis bernard didn't bother to tell us. what does that mean?
JO: it means mr. bernard is a very mysterious man.
BEN: he struck me as quite normal
JO: what do you know about him?
BEN: i know his name...and, uh....
JO: you see? and he knows you' re an american living in indianapolis, indiana. a doctor at the good samaritan. you have a garden with snails, a wife, a boy who can spell haemoglobin. you went to a medical convention in paris. stopped at rome, lisbon, casablanca. you once served in north africa with an army field hospital --
BEN: now hold on. wait a minute. we were just talking casually...
JO: not talking.

JO: he was asking, you were telling. you might as well have handed him your passport. 
BEN: what difference does it make? i have nothing to hide.
JO: maybe mr. bernard has.
BEN: jo. i know this is mysterious morocco. inscrutable natives gliding through twisted, narrow streets, but --
JO: oh, ben!
BEN: then relax. you're just mad because he didn't ask any questions about you.
JO: bitter medicine, doctor. but i'll swallow it.
JO: well. this eases the pain.
HANK: what pain, mummy?
JO: just an expression.
PORTER: bon jour, monsieur.
PORTER: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 15.
BEN: will you take care of the driver?

DRAYTON: est-ce que vous etes libre? jevous prend. 
PORTER: oui, m'sieu.

JO: we're being watched. 
BEN: oh come on.

HANK: how about it, mummy? one chorus. 
JO: i'm a little out of form, hank.
HANK: one chorus, and that's all.
JO: all right, mr. hammerstein. what's your pleasure?
HANK: quo sera sera. like you and alfred drake. i'll be alfred drake.
JO: what's your key?
HANK: whatever i happen to hit.
HANK: how's that?
JO: pretty original.
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 17.
HANK: let's go.
HANK: when i was a little boy i asked my mother "what will i be?" will i be handsome? will i be rich? here's what she said to me: jo takes up the song. her voice is obviously professional, but beyond that, quite beautiful.
JO: que sera sera, whatever will be will be the future's not ours to see que sera sera what will be will be que sera sera.

JO: que sera sera, whatever will be will be the future's not ours to see que sera sera! whatever will be will be que sera sera!

JO: now i have children of my own they ask their mother "what will i be?" will i be handsome? will i be rich? i tell them tenderly: they sing the chorus in harmony together.

HANK: there goes our sock finish!

WAITER: dinaire for thee boy.

LOUIS: she's marvelous. too bad it was interrupted.
LOUIS: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 19.
BEN: i've had the same feeling. often.

JO: he said the manager is going to send up somebody to baby sit. 
BEN: good.
LOUIS: mrs. mckenna, permit me the pleasure of serving you a drink.
JO: thank you.
LOUIS: were you on the american stage, mrs.

LOUIS: madame. 
JO: thank you. let's sit where it's cool.
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 20.
JO: yes, i was on the american stage, and the london stage, and even the paris stage.
LOUIS: oh?
JO: i thought you might have seen me in paris -- being french, and --
LOUIS: the theater, requires time, and for me time is often a luxury.
JO: have you ever been to paris, mr.
LOUIS: i was born there.
J0: what do you do for a living?
LOUIS: buy and sell.
JO: what?
LOUIS: whatever gives the best profit.
JO: just what are you buying, or selling, now in marrakesh?
LOUIS: you know, i would much rather talk about the stage. if you tell me what to answer any? before he can answer, there is a knock at the door, and he looks toward it. she gets to her feet, and starts for the door.
LOUIS: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 21.
JO: i'll answer it.

RIEN: i am inquiring for the room of a monsieur montgomery. he asked me for a drink, and l -- 
BEN: sorry, there's no montgomery here.
RIEN: then pardon me, monsieur, i regret disturbing you.
BEN: it's all right.

HANK: mummy -- i can't cut this meat! 
JO: i'll do it, hank.

HEADWAITER: bonsoir, madame, monsieur. 
BEN: good evening. my name is mckenna.

BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 24.

JO: you're right. people are staring at us. 
BEN: what people?
JO: they stared at us when we went into the hotel.
BEN: jo, will you stop imagining things?

MRS. DRAYTON: good evening. 
MRS. DRAYTON: you must think me awfully rude. i've been staring at you ever since i saw you at the hotel.
MRS. DRAYTON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 25.
JO: yes, i am.
MRS. DRAYTON: didn't i tell you? i knew i was right.
MRS. DRAYTON: i'm lucy drayton, and this is my husband.
DRAYTON: how do you do, sir!
BEN: how do you do. we're mr. and mrs.
DRAYTON: my wife tells me mrs. mckenna appeared at the london palladium a few years ago.
MRS. DRAYTON: of course we hardly ever see a show. edward is such an old stick-in-the- mud. so i have to console myself with your records.
DRAYTON: and i must admit i love 'em. i'm not one for this terrible bee bop or whatever you call it.
JO: thank you, mr. drayton.
MRS. DRAYTON: when are you coming back to london?
JO: possibly never again, professionally.
MRS. DRAYTON: don't tell me you've given up the stage.
JO: temporarily.
BEN: it's just that i'm a doctor... yes.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 26.
JO: what ben means is that there are no broadway musical shows produced in indianapolis, indiana. of course, if we lived in new york... ...where i hear doctors aren't starving...
BEN: i have nothing against working in new york. nothing except the fact that it's very hard for my patients to come all the way from indianapolis for treatment.
MRS. DRAYTON: oh dear, oh dear. i'm always saying the wrong thing.
JO: not the least, mrs. drayton.
MRS. DRAYTON: tell me; dr. mckenna do you always.....
BEN: do you think we could get straightened around.

DRAYTON: only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand. never use the smaller fingers. and always keep the left hand in the lap. 
JO: does it have something to do with religion?
DRAYTON: more social than religious, i'd say.
DRAYTON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 27.
BEN: it seems to me if you have four good fingers, and a thumb, you should use them all.
J0: three finger -- four fingers -- for my money this is nothing but chicken in the rough. we have it at every drive- in back home.
DRAYTON: well, as i was saying, i was quite happy farming my bit of land it buckinghamshire, when these chaps from the united nations started worrying me.
MRS. DRAYTON: edward was a big noise at the ministry of food during the war, you know.
DRAYTON: so, i pulled myself up by the roots, and here we are. united nations relief.
BEN: that sounds like interesting work.
DRAYTON: you should see my report on soil erosion in morocco... but nobody reads it.
LOUIS: trouvez nous un coin tranquille -- c'est possible?

BEN: look, we only met him today. we can't expect him to change his whole life --
JO: oh, ben! what's the matter with you?!
BEN: nothing! what's the matter with you?!
JO: i just don't like to be both privately and publicly insulted.
BEN: can you blame him? turning down an old married couple for a date with a girl like that?
JO: we're not an old married couple! all right -- he's a heel. i don't understand him -- and i'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night.
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 29.
MRS. DRAYTON: i must do some shopping in the market tomorrow. i do hope it'll be fine. fine, but not too fine. of course, i how our english weather is awful, but i sometimes think we don't know when we're lucky. all this sunshine, day after day. it seems unnatural, somehow.
BEN: i want to get up.
JO: ben, i know you -- once you get worked up, you'll start a fight. now please, sit down and forget him.
DRAYTON: by the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd let us show you round the market place, tomorrow.
JO: louis bernard, the big buyer from paris, was going to take us through the market tomorrow.
BEN: good. i'll just go over and cancel out.
JO: ben, don't. our dinner's getting cold. we'd love to go with you.

MRS. DRAYTON: he's the teller of tales, hank. he reads legends and famous old stories from history.

J0: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 32.
BEN: wouldn't you rather be in now york -- rehearsing?
JO: oh, all that talk last night was just social chit chat, every woman who ever gave up the stage for marriage is supposed to want to go back. i was just playing a part expected of me.
BEN: well, if you do -- let's talk about it -- seriously.
JO: no, if at all, let's talk about it humorously.
HANK: mummy! daddy!
HANK: come on with us! we're gonna see the medicine man! maybe you on learn something, daddy.
BEN: you're probably right.
J0: any time he starts wearing you out --
MRS. DRAYTON: i've never enjoyed the market place so much. oh!
HANK: come on!

JO: ben, this whole market place is very different and exciting. 
BEN: just like the county fairs when i was a kid. they'd get everything but the balloon ascension.
BEN: that didn't sound too hilarious to me.
JO: i was just thinking...do you know what's paying for these three days in marrakesh? ben chuckles.
JO: and the purse i bought in paris...
HANK: mummy! daddy!
HANK: come on with us! we're gonna see the medicine man! maybe you can learn something, daddy.
BEN: you're probably right.
JO: any time he starts wearing you out...

BEN: oh fine, fine. haven't dropped anybody yet.

BEN: all the way home we'll be riding on herbie taylor's ulcors. 
J0: and allida markle's asthma.
BEN: oh, i know it's just a song and a dance here and there... but it's all he thinks about. show business.
JO: ben, you're setting a trap for me.
BEN: he has a good mind. give him a chance to develop it.
JO: you mean give him a change to be a doctor?
BEN: i didn't say that.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 35.

JO: all right, darling, a deal's a deal. 
JO: for every time step he'll learn a new muscle -- and for every chorus, three bones.
BEN: and for every matinee?
JO: two chapters of grey's anatomy.
HANK: hey, mummy. sewing machines! looks like a television commercial.
BEN: now if we could only get four cases of the seven-year itch, we could retire. or, if mrs. yarros really has triplets, we could at least redecorate the house.
J0: oh, ben, what would they say if they heard us?

BEN: one of the reasons i came to a place like marrakesh is so that we could say things like this without anybody hearing us. 
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 36.
JO: i'd like to say something where nobody can hear us.
BEN: this is the safest place.
JO: when are we going to have another child? ben looks at her with some surprise.

JO: having a good time, hank?

POLICE MAN: dites leur que j'aimerai qu'ils viennent tous les deux au commissariat pour faire un rapport.
DRAYTON: just as i thought. he wants both of you to go to police headquarters to make a statement.
BEN: do we have to?
DRAYTON: i'm afraid so. our friends here have to go to the police station. i'm going with them to give what help i can.

MRS. DRAYTON: you don't want your little boy to go, do you? 
HANK: i wanna go. i never saw a french police station before.

BEN: what's more important -- why was he killed?
JO: i'll bet he was a spy, or something like that.
JO: ben, what did he whisper to you? what did you write down?
BEN: i'll tell you later.
JO: what is it?

JO: i have to stretch.
DRAYTON: i'm afraid the questions will go on till doomsday, if you admit knew this chap bernard before.
BEN: i didn't know him at all. we only met yesterday on a bus.
DRAYTON: they're a cynical lot, these french -- they might refuse to believe that.
BEN: they'll have to believe me. it's true.
DRAYTON: it might sound a bit odd, from their point of view. they saw the poor chap whispering to you ... and then they saw you writing something down...
DRAYTON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 46. ben looks at drayton, waiting for his to go on.
DRAYTON: the question is, are you going to show them what you wrote down?

DRAYTON: ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les mckenna. mon nom est drayton. ils ne parlent pas francais et ils m'ont demandã© de traduire. 
INSPECTOR: thank you, monsieur drayton, but a translator will not be necessary. won't you come inside, monsieur, madame?

INSPECTOR: you entered french morocco four days ago. 
BEN: that's right.
INSPECTOR: you are a doctor, monsieur?
BEN: a surgeon. a tourist, and an american citizen.
INSPECTOR: three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with louis bernard.
BEN: i didn't have.
INSPECTOR: you were recently in paris?
BEN: a medical convention.
INSPECTOR: you come to marrakesh with him in the same bus. you drank an apã©ritif with him in your hotel room. and you ate at the same restaurant last night.
JO: but at different tables.
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 48.
INSPECTOR: so, louis bernard is a stranger to you?
BEN: i met him yesterday -- on the bus -- for the first time in my life.
INSPECTOR: and yet -- out of five thousand people -- in a great market place -- he comes to you when he is about to die! is that the action of a casual acquaintance, monsieur?
BEN: i know nothing about louis bernard.
INSPECTOR: no? not even, i suppose, that he was an agent of the dã©uxieme bureau?
BEN: what's that?
INSPECTOR: perhaps you have also never head of the american f.b.i.? it would be so much more easy for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend.
BEN: now, look here...
INSPECTOR: the dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover. that is why he was kill-ed. he told you what he had discovered. why? because he placed complete confidence in you.
BEN: boy, you not only ask the questions you also answer them -- wait a minute let me ask you a question.
INSPECTOR: indeed, monsieur?
INSPECTOR: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 49.
BEN: assuming bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, i would never reveal anything he said to me, would

INSPECTOR: even americans, i suppose, sometimes find it desirable to betray a confidence? 
BEN: let's get something straight. i'm a tourist traveling for pleasure. i somehow got involved in an unfortunate incident. i came down here to make a simple statement of fact, and not to be subjected to a police grilling.
INSPECTOR: monsieur, i would like....
BEN: now hold your horses! just hold them.

DRAYTON: at least nobody's seen her. what on earth...
BEN: look -- you get back to the hotel right away -- and see if you can find out what's going on.
DRAYTON: it's so unlike my wife...
BEN: i'll finish up with the police and join you as soon as i can.
DRAYTON: right. but don't worry. probably some stupid misunderstanding. if i find out anything before you get back, i'll ring you here.
BEN: just don't waste any time!
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 53.

JO: who was it, ben? 
BEN: it was the concierge at the hotel. he heard we were being held by the police and thought there was some way he could help us.
JO: that was nice of him.
BEN: i told him if we weren't back there in fifteen minutes to call the american consulate in casablanca. the inspector has realised that he won't get any more out of ben.
INSPECTOR: but, monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place, that you wished to consult with your consul!
BEN: let's go, jo.
INSPECTOR: there is just one small formality. i must request you to sign a statement of the facts.
BEN: if it doesn't take too long.
INSPECTOR: but a moment. i will send for a typist.
JO: ben...
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 54.

BEN: i don't -- i don't think you should.
JO: i'm your wife, ben -- not the police inspector. let's see it.

J0: why didn't you give this to the police? 
BEN: because i didn't want to.
JO: but ben, a man's life --
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 55.
J0: i thought we ought to go back to the hotel, pack our clothes, take hank, and get out of this country as quickly as we can.
BEN: maybe.
JO: hank, seeing a man killed in front of him. what a shook it must be to his mind.
BEN: i know.
JO: why don't you just give that note to the american consulate -- why get any more involved?
BEN: jo...about hank...
JO: what about him?

BEN: no, mr. drayton, the englishman with horn-rimmed glasses.
HEAD PORTER: oui, m'sieu. checked out.

JO: frankly, i'm exhausted. don't you feel well? 
JO: i'll call mrs. drayton and tell her we're back. she can bring hank up here, or i'll go get his.
BEN: jo, hold the call for a minute.
JO: why?
BEN: because i asked you to.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 58.
JO: ben...we're about to have our monthly fight.
BEN: i hope we don't.

BEN: wait 'til i come back.

BEN: something to relax you. 
JO: i'm so relaxed i'm tired. you take them.
BEN: jo, they're for you. i'm the doctor.
JO: ben...
BEN: you know how you get when things happen -- tense and upset. now do me a favor. she stands up.
JO: six months ago you told me i took too many pills!
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 59.
BEN: six months ago you weren't a witness to a murder. you've been excited, fatigued -- talking a blue streak and going around in circles.
JO: i have not.
BEN: jo, i make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine. you'll feel a lot better tomorrow if you take these today. but you don't think so.
JO: i'm listening.
BEN: there's something about louis bernard, the police station, and this whole spy business that i haven't told you yet.
BEN: this is the price of curiosity.
JO: what could it be?
BEN: there's one way to find out.
JO: all right, doctor mckenna. i am now relaxed and listening.

JO: why don't i call mrs. drayton first. you can tell me while she's bringing hank up. 
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 60.
BEN: just a minute. this whole thing strange right from the very beginning.
BEN: it was no accident that louis bernard helped us out on the bus, and struck up a conversation. you were right about him.
JO: see.
BEN: yes...yes, you were right about him. he was...was strange.
JO: i know all that. get to the surprise.
BEN: he got talking to us because he was on the lookout for a suspicious married couple.
JO: nothing suspicious about us.
BEN: he was wrong. it was a different married couple.
JO: and he was killed before he found them.
BEN: no. he found them. in the restaurant.
JO: you'll be telling me next it was mr.
BEN: that's just who it was, jo.
JO: if that's a joke, i don't think it's a very funny one.
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 61.
JO: think i'll lie down.
BEN: listen to me. and listen carefully.
BEN: that phone call i received at the police station. she nods dumbly.
BEN: it wasn't from the concierge at the hotel. it was from somebody with a foreign voice who said if i told anybody one word of what. louis bernard whispered to me in the market place that something...something might happen to...to, to hank.
JO: hank? why h... ?
BEN: they've taken him away.
JO: mrs. drayton took hank back to the hotel. she is downstairs!
BEN: mrs. drayton has vanished! she never came back here! and hank didn't either!
JO: well let's start looking for him. mr. drayton...mr. drayton should...
BEN: jo, mr. drayton, checked out of the hotel thirty or forty minutes ago!
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 62.
JO: ben!! i could kill you! sedative!
JO: all this time you, knew hank was gone, and you wouldn't tell me.
BEN: i wasn't sure, until now.
JO: he's my child more than yours! i had him.
JO: let go of me! i'll never never never forget this! we've got to find hank! we've got to find him.
JO: you think you're the only one strong enough to take anything? ben, ben, i hate you, with my whole heart. hank! where is hank? hank, oh hank! get him, ben. please. you miserable human...how could anybody...do...

J0: i...never wanted to...come here in...first...place...oh hank, hank darling...if i ever...wake...i'll kill...you...you... 
J0: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 63.
BEN: darling, if somebody did this to me, i'd say just what you said.

BEN: both the draytons are definitely gone. the hotel register says they come from london. drayton told the concierge he was a college professor. the only thing to do now is to get out of marrakesh. 
BEN: as individuals we're helpless here. and because of that phone call, we can't bring the police in on it. i even thought of taking that chance.
BEN: but connect hank's disappearance to louis bernard's murder. and the first thing they'd do would be to make me tell them louis bernard's message. that...that could be, hank's...well, it wouldn't help him.
BEN: we're going to london.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 66.
BEN: i found out. the draytons had a private plane -- that's how they took hank back. it could lend anywhere -- no question of a passport or anything.
BEN: so we're going to london to find him.
BEN: we've only got a few hours, jo! we have to got up and start moving.
BEN: i've paid the bill, and there's a car waiting downstairs. as soon as i pack, we're leaving.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 67.

FADE OUT.: fade in:

OFFICIAL: would you mind waiting for the press photographers? 
JO: how could they remember me so well, ben? it's been four years since i played london.
BEN: i guess you're the kind of girl they don't forget.
JO: but how did they know...who could have told them...ben, you didn't...?
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 68. she breaks off.
BEN: all i did was wire val and helen parnell to get us rooms -- he indicates fans and newspapermen.
BEN: but i didn't count on this --

EDINGTON: i'm inspector edington of the criminal investigation department of scotland yard. 
EDINGTON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 69.
BEN: yes? what is it?
EDINGTON: as things are, there's no need for you to go through the customs. will you come this way!
BEN: whatever you say.
EDINGTON: this way, please.

EDINGTON: this is mr. woburn -- doctor and mrs. 
WOBURN: how do you do?
BEN: now what do you people want with us?
WOBURN: mr. buchanan would like to have a chat with you, inside.
BEN: who is mr. buchanan?
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 70.
WOBURN: special branch, scotland yard.

WOBURN: this is mr. buchanan -- doctor and mrs. mckenna. 
BUCHANAN: how do you do?
BUCHANAN: thank you, woburn.
BUCHANAN: do sit down, won't you?
BEN: why does scotland yard want to talk with us?
BUCHANAN: let me say at once, we're shocked... that you son was taken from you in marrakesh and deeply sympathetic.

JO: do you know where he is? 
BEN: what about hank? what have you heard?
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 71.
BUCHANAN: i only wish i could give you some cheerful news.
BUCHANAN: we might find him. quite soon, indeed, if we work together...louis bernard was sent to marrakesh by the french at our request to check up on an assassination plot -- here, in london. a good agent keeps on staking his life. he doesn't always win.
BUCHANAN: bernard reckoned you were a man to trust. he relied on you, to come to us.
BUCHANAN: those people kidnapped your boy -- in order to keep your mouth shut. that's right, isn't it?
BEN: i think they took him for money.
BUCHANAN: then why didn't you go straight to your consulate in casablanca? why did you come to london?
JO: mr. buchanan --
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 72.
BEN: jo...

BUCHANAN: you're convinced that these people brought your son to london. you're convinced you can find him -- off your own bat. you can't. it's impossible. but with the help we can give you, there's a chance. a really good chance. 
JO: they told us not to say anything!

BUCHANAN: anything you tell me will be in the most absolute confidence. 
BEN: that might be true, but -- buchanan holds up a hand to interrupt him.
BUCHANAN: your son is the trump card these people hold. he's perfectly safe -- for the moment.
JO: and when they've done what they're going to do, they'll let him go. so all we have to do is wait.
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 73.
BUCHANAN: no, mrs. mckenna. if they consider the boy a nuisance, afterwards -- i'm afraid -- he gestures.
BEN: now, don't try to frighten us, mr.
BUCHANAN: it's exactly what i'm trying to do -- frighten you. i'm trying to prevent a man being murdered here, in london.
BUCHANAN: if you don't tell me all you know, you become an accessory before the fact of murder. in english law, you become just short of murderers yourselves.

JO: ben, what can we do by ourselves? we need -- 
BEN: you worked on the wrong mckenna, mr. buchanan. louis bernard talked to me, not my wife.
BUCHANAN: then you tell me.
BEN: bernard spoke in french, and i don't understand a word of the language.
BUCHANAN: and what did you write down on a piece of paper?
BUCHANAN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 74.
JO: ben -- maybe they could find those people, and hank, before --
BEN: maybe. maybe isn't good enough for me, and it shouldn't be good enough for you.
JO: you act as if you're the only one who's concerned about hank.
BEN: now jo, i didn't mean it that way. we made up our minds what we were going to do -- now let's try to stick to it.
BEN: we'd like to cooperate with you, mr.
BUCHANAN: i have a son of my own. i don't know what i'd do... jo looks at ben appealingly. even ben is uncertain now, trying to evaluate things quickly,
BEN: well, maybe if we --

JAN: see. we could have talked.

RIEN: what is it?
DRAYTON: a record of the delightful picco they will play tonight.
RIEN: what about it?
DRAYTON: music is less in your line than marksmanship. if you will listen, my friend, i will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot. now listen carefully.
DRAYTON: let me do it for you again. now listen for the cymbal crash.
DRAYTON: you see at such a moment your shot will not be heard. the listeners will not even be disturbed. i think the composer would have appreciated that.
RIEN: none except one you mean.
DRAYTON: ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend. any questions musical or otherwise?
RIEN: no.
DRAYTON: there's's one comforting thought. it happens early in the evening. i hope i won't upset you if i say there's time for one shot only. if you need another, the risk is yours.
DRAYTON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 104.
RIEN: i do not take risks.

DRAYTON: your distinguished target's on the way there now. a car is waiting for you downstairs at the back entrance. you will pick up a miss benson on your way. she will be your companion in the box. she's there to lend an air of respectability...if that's possible.
RIEN: you will have the money when i return?
DRAYTON: i think you can trust me.
RIEN: what is your english proverb -- a wolf in sheep's clothing?
DRAYTON: i think you had better be going. it is impolite to be late for a concert. it would be awkward if they made you wait until the first selection is over.
DRAYTON: see him downstairs, my dear. i'm sorry you must sneak out the back way, but we have to preserve our respectable front.

JO: there it is. 
BEN: you may have just hit it right on the nose. you can't be farther wrong than i was with my ambrose chapel. let's go.
JO: ben, should we get some help from the police?
BEN: no, honey, please, no -- let's take a crack at this alone.

BEN: what do you want? i'll give you money and keep my mouth shut. all i want is my boy. 
DRAYTON: and what about your wife? did she go outside just to get some fresh air.
BEN: tell me what you want. i'll do anything.

HANK: daddy! daddy, i'm here! dad -

J0: he sent me out to call you -- so we could do something before they get away. 
WOBURN: i see, mrs. mckenna -- and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel?
JO: i don't know, i don't know where he is...but at least these people will know -- the draytons. if you'd only send somebody to get them.
WOBURN: i'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that.
J0: mr. woburn, there isn't any time! my husband is sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help. can't i talk with mr. buchanan? he said when we needed him, to call.
WOBURN: i'm awfully sorry, but i simply can't get hold of him just now. he's gone to a rather important diplomatic affair -- at the albert hall.
JO: well call him there, please! call him!

WOBURN: he's on his way. i don't know quite -- 
JO: then can't you do anything -- right away -- before we lose the draytons?
WOBURN: i assure you, i'll do all i cant as soon as i can.
JO: we don't have days to do this. it's a matter of minutes. can't you send the police. or do i have to go to the albert hall myself.
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 113.

WOBURN: that won't be necessary. i'll see that the chapel is put under immediate observation. by the time you get back a police car should be there. please return to your husband, tell him to come straight out of the chapel, and let the police take over. 
WOBURN: woburn, special branch, hold on. i must ring off now, mrs. mckenna. please believe me, i'll have everything laid on.

JO: there's nobody there! 
PATTERSON: are you mrs. mckenna?
PATTERSON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 115.
JO: yes, but something's wrong. a few minutes ago the place was full of people, and now there's nobody!
PATTERSON: our orders are to keep it under observation until a scotland yard car arrives.
JO: my husband's in there. there must have been thirty or forty people... and now...
PATTERSON: when was this?
JO: it couldn't...it couldn't have been more than five minutes ago!
PATTERSON: let's take a look.
JO: i told mr. woburn he had to hurry.

JO: i tried that. it's looked, let's force it open. 
PATTERSON: i'm sorry, madam, we can't break in. requires a search warrant. it's the law, you see.
JO: couldn't you get one?
PATTERSON: it all takes time. we'll have a look round, shall we? matthews, you take the other end.
PATTERSON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 116.
MATTHEWS: all right.

MATTHEWS: there's no one there, sir. 
PATTERSON: are you quite certain the place was full of people -- only a few minutes ago?
JO: of course i'm certain. i was there myself, sitting next to my husband. he sent me out to call scotland yard.
J0: it's much too complicated to explain.
PATTERSON: we'll just have to sit tight and wait for the car to arrive from the yard.
PATTERSON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 117.

PATTERSON: so far as we can make out, sir, there's no sign of life. i see, very good, sir. 
PATTERSON: walden, you'll stay here, till the car arrives from the yard.
WALDEN: okay.
PATTERSON: that's all, matthews.
JO: you're not leaving?
PATTERSO: orders, madam. can we give you lift somewhere? jo is frustrated, and irritated, but she thinks for a moment and makes a sudden decision.
JO: yes, i want to go to albert hall.
PATTERSON: afraid the albert hall's a bit off our beat. suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank?
JO: all right. let's go.
JO: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 118.

GUARD: hello. hello. 
GUARD: everybody out into the corridor. hurry
BUTLER: do what he says. come on. it will only be a minute. come on, all of you -- out.

ANOTHER VOICE: bringing people in, in secret... 
ANOTHER VOICE: give me the swiss embassy every time, there's neutrality for you!

UNIFORMED ATTENDANT: seats at a guinea. starting room three and six -- jo moves out of the queue and addresses him. 
JO: i would like to see the manager, please.
UNIFORMED ATTENDANT: i'm sorry, madam, the manager's on duty in the lobby. so's his assistant.
JO: please, i must speak to one of them.
UNIFORMED ATTENDANT: over there somewhere...

1ST GIRL: is that the prime minister? 
2ND GIRL: no, that's only the ambassador. the prime minister's the one with the bald head.
2ND GIRL: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 123.
1ST GIRL: well, i'll guarantee he's got a better seat than we have.

RIEN: you have a very nice little boy, madame. 
J0: where is he? where is he?
J0: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 124.

TICKET COLLECTOR: your ticket, madam? 
JO: if you don't mind, i'm just looking for someone.

BEN: then he didn't kill him? 
ASSISTANT MANAGER: your wife saved him -- it is only a small flesh wound...oh here he is now...you must come and meet him...don't be nervous...i'll get the aide to present you...it will be all right would you present the lady to the prime minister?
BUCHANAN: i'll report to you fully at the embassy, your excellency. in the meantime...

WOBURN: mr. prime minister, this is the lady who -- 
PRIME MINISTER: my dear lady, i shall be for ever in your debt.
WOBURN: and this is her husband -- the prime minister interrupts again, less enthusiastically.
PRIME MINISTER: a pleasure, my dear sir... i trust you will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my gratitude.
JO: it wasn't -- it wasn't --

BUCHANAN: so you both know the time and place all along. 
BEN: don't be a fool.
BEN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 137.
BUCHANAN: an odd coincidence -- both of you turning up here.
BEN: too bad you didn't contact your assistant. he sent us both here.
BUCHANAN: i beg your pardon.
BEN: you see, we finally needed that help you offered. we still need it.
DETECTIVE: sir?
DETECTIVE: we've questioned the woman. said she bought a ticket that happened to place her in the same box with the man that did the shooting. doesn't know anything -- but if she does, she's not talking.
BUCHANAN: i'll see her later.
DETECTIVE: very good, sir.
BUCHANAN: please tell me everything, now. everything. there's still plenty of room for hope, mrs. mckenna...

DRAYTON: excuse me sir, i have a lot to explain to you -- something very unusual has happened. i must also have the money to pay our french marksman. 
AMBASSADOR: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 139.
AMBASSADOR: his aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. the target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. worse than useless.
AMBASSADOR: then your french friend panicked, and made a fatal crash -- landing on the floor of the albert hall.
DRAYTON: i don't see how you can hold me responsible. he was most warmly recommended by our people in marrakesh...
AMBASSADOR: i'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. i am holding a reception here this evening. in a few minutes, i have to welcome our prime minister as my guest of honor -- when i hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. that amuses you, no doubt?
DRAYTON: i don't know what to say ...
AMBASSADOR: no. but i do. you've muddled everything from the start. kidnapping that child in marrakesh...don't you realize that americans dislike having their children kidnapped?
DRAYTON: how else could i make sure the american would hold his tongue?
AMBASSADOR: and then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide -- and bring the child with you: don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this embassy?
AMBASSADOR: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 140.
DRAYTON: i didn't think...i only thought...
AMBASSADOR: how are you going to get the child out of here, eh? eh? eh? eh?
DRAYTON: there's no difficulty about that, surely? the car --
AMBASSADOR: with plain-clothes detectives planted right round this building? you english intellectuals will be the death of us all.
DRAYTON: i'll think of some method. just give me time....
AMBASSADOR: time!
AMBASSADOR: i want the child removed from this embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight.
MRS. DRAYTON: oh, no!
DRAYTON: right, i'll see to it..
DRAYTON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 141.
AMBASSADOR: come in.
BUTLER: your excellency, the princess should be arriving at any moment.
BEN: ...recognized him, and he recognized me. so he jumped for it. and that is all.
BUCHANAN: trying to liquidate one of their own big-shots. i wish they'd stick to their usual custom, and do it in their own country... at this moment the phone rings. woburn, who is now re- placing the two special branch men in the room, picks up the telephone.
WOBURN: hello. hold on.
BUCHANAN: buchanan speaking.
BUCHANAN: right. bye.
BUCHANAN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 142.
BUCHANAN: the draytons are at the embassy.
JO: how do you know?
BUCHANAN: we have ways of finding out -- from the inside.
BEN: if the draytons are at the embassy, hank has to be there too!
BUCHANAN: you're probably right. but we can do nothing.
BEN: why can't you?
BUCHANAN: every embassy in a foreign country has extra-territorial rights.
BEN: what does that mean in common language?
BUCHANAN: as far as we're concerned, this embassy stands on foreign soil.
BEN: does that mean they can steal children and get away with it?
BUCHANAN: we could have the foreign office serve a writ on the ambassador.
BUCHANAN: ...you know, i'm not responsible for the complications of international law...
BUCHANAN: ...if only we had positive proof that the boy really is in there.
BUCHANAN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 143.
BEN: what's the telephone number of this embassy.
WONBURN: grosvenor 0144.
JO: what are you thinking about, ben?
BEN: grosvenor 0144.
BEN: i'm going to speak to the minister himself.
BEN: may i speak to the prime minister, please?
BEN: tell him the lady who saved his life wants to speak to him. its important.
JO: what am i supposed to say, ben? i don't know -- ben, half looking at woburn and buchanan, gives her instructions.
BFN: he said he wanted to visit us soon so he could thank you.

PRIME MINISTER: my dear lady...this is a charming surprise... 
PRIME MINISTER: delighted, delighted, delighted. the ambassador, too, will be delighted. any friends of mine are friends of his. we will drink a little toast to your country and to mine. peacefully we will co-exist...yes?

PRIME MINISTER: good evening, good evening! the ambassador is behind the prime minister, and the prime minister turns to him with enthusiasm. 
PRIME MINISTER: this is the charming lady who saved my life at the concert!
PRIME MINISTER: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 146.
AMBASSADOR: madame, you saved the life of the one man, who is irreplaceable in our country.
PRIME MINISTER: they tell me you are the famous jo conway, madame?
JO: yes. i'm jo conway.
PRIME MINISTER: do you think perhaps madame might be persuaded to sing?
BEN: i'm sure she would be glad to...
JO: well, i don't know. it's been some time...
PRIME MINISTER: i beg you, madame. a tranquil coda to conclude a dramatic evening!
JO: all right. i'm very flattered.
AMBASSADOR: stanis would you put up some chairs quickly. ladies and gentlemen, we have with us tonight...jo conway...the famous jo conway...she has graciously consented to sing for us .. darling would you see that the prime minister has a very good seat. they move off to seats -- jo is led to piano by ambassador. aide crosses to ben.

MRS. DRAYTON: hank? -- can you whistle that song? 
HANK: i guess so.
MRS DRAYTON: then go on -- whistle it. whistle it as loud as you can.

BEN: i don't think you want to start any shooting, drayton -- with all those people downstairs, and police outside. 
MRS. DRAYTON: you've got to let the boy go!
MRS. DRAYTON: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 152.
DRAYTON: precisely my own notion, my dear.
DRAYTON: i'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help me out of here?
BEN: don't ask me for help, you miserable....

DRAYTON: we'll go down the stairs together in a casual sort of way. then we'll stroll along to the nearest taxi rank. i trust there won't be any emotional outbursts... 
BEN: there won't be. hank -- don't say or do anything.
DRAYTON: shall we go?
