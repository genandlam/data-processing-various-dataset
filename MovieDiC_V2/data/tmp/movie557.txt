VIG: congratulations, you got yourself a rag head, my man. 
VIG: dag.
TROY: "gettin' bugged drivin' up and down the same old strip, gotta find a new place where the kids are hip, i get around --"
SOLDIER #1: i didn't think i'd see anyone get shot over here.
VIG: it looked like the guy's head blew three feet into the air --
FANTASY SEQUENCE IN SLOW MOTION: the iraqi's head pops three feet into the air.

SOLDIER #1: bullshit, that's not what happened. 
VIG: i said it
SOLDIER #3: carl weathers. his arm gets shot off.
VIG: and when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on firing.
SCENE FROM 'PREDATOR': carl weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing.

SOLDIER #5: take my picture. 
VIG: do you still want to sell pictures?
TROY: for twenty.
SOLDIER #5: twenty dollars, man, what's the meaning of life?
TROY: you're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war.
VIG: war's been over five days, jim, ain't gonna be much more of this.
SOLDIER #5: bobby, take my picture.
SOLDIER #4: if he shot the guy, it's up to him.
SOLDIER #5: it's not like he shot a deer. it's the enemy.
VIG: troy's enemy, yours for twenty.
TROY: accept no substitute, this is the real thing, oh, [winces] --
VIG: what's wrong?
TROY: i got a really bad headache all of a sudden--
VIG: no free pictures, motherfucker.

BILL SMITHSON: spirits are high and the music is boisterous as these young troops celebrate -- let me try that again. 
BILL SMITHSON: spirits are high and the music is sand in my eye --
ARCHIE GATES: is that what you got from this experience? a watch?
HAVICHON: ees a great watch.
ARCHIE GATES: there's 700 million in gold out there and you're around with a watch?
HAVICHON: bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of gold, man.
ARCHIE GATES: one bunker of gold and we retire from this horseshit, hashy--

BILL SMITHSON: i'm trying to do a story here and the sand is blowing in my face -- 
ARCHIE GATES: you want me to stop the sand? i can't do anything about that.
BILL SMITHSON: no, you're too busy talking about the gold, which by the way makes a great story if you'd get me a lead on it --
ARCHIE GATES: i think the saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, i mean, he's still here beating the out of his country.
BILL SMITHSON: would you just be my guide and not my producer? you're my guide.
ARCHIE GATES: ok, go do your celebration story, bill.

BILL SMITHSON: you're heroes. 
SOLDIER #6: we're heroes.
SOLDIER #7: give war a chance.
BILL SMITHSON: you've exorcised the ghosts of vietnam with a clear moral imperative --
SOLDIER #5: is that what we did?

SOLDIER #6: we didn't get rid of saddam -- 
SOLDIER #8: which totally a big
SOLDIER #6: those people are getting reemed --
SOLDIER #7: bullshit, we saved kuwait, man.
BILL SMITHSON: who's getting reemed? the shiites?
SOLDIER #8: i don't know who they are, man --
SOLDIER #6: we got big firepower but we ain't saving them --
SOLDIER #5: that, we liberated kuwait.
SOLDIER #1: 'if tomorrow all the things were gone that i worked for all my life and i had to start again with just my children and my wife--'

SOLDIERS: 'i'd thank my lucky stars to -- 
CHOPPER PILOTS: '--be livin' here today because the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that awayyyyy --'

TRANSLATOR: hasnala shi aluno quibaan -- 
CAPTAIN VAN METER: we will not hurt you. lay down your weapons, get on the ground --

TROY: it's cool, no one's gonna hurt you -- 
VIG: did you and torture anybody in kuwait, abdul?
TROY: you're making them all hysterical.
VIG: take your rags off, take this off. no comprende english,
TROY: what is your problem, conrad?
VIG: i'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off.
VIG: whoa, it's a freaky thing, troy.
TROY: there's a document in that guy's ass, conrad.
VIG: that's the freaky thing.
WALTER: do you think he ate it?
TROY: it wouldn't come out perfect like that if he ate it.
TROY: go get it, private.
IRAQI OFFICER: hasa man timal!
TROY: open it up.
VIG: you only gave me one glove.
TROY: i'm sorry i don't have another, but you gotta open it up. that's how the chain of command works.

VIG: what the is that? 
TROY: important enough to squeeze your cheeks for.

CATHY DAITCH: you are a trained warrior, trained warrior, trained warrior, christ, colonel! 
CATHY DAITCH: what's bill got?
ARCHIE GATES: just the celebration story.
CATHY DAITCH: that's it?
ARCHIE GATES: that's it --
ARCHIE GATES: how about you? did you find anything?
CATHY DAITCH: it could be another lead but i need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold --
ARCHIE GATES: who's the guy?
CATHY DAITCH: somebody barlow, maybe in company

ARCHIE GATES: barlow. 
CATHY DAITCH: got a map out of a prisoner's head.
ARCHIE GATES: out of a prisoner's head?
CATHY DAITCH: or his ear, or his ass, or his dick, and they got like a fifty page full-color mini atlas of saddam's bunkers --
ARCHIE GATES: out of a guy's dick?

GENERAL PYE: i give you a prestige job in the media war of the century and the guy feels neglected. 
ARCHIE GATES: i'm helping him plenty with his big celebration feature --
ARCHIE GATES: for what? i don't even know what we did over here, but schwartzkopf gets a book deal, you get a star, powell gets to be president--
GENERAL HORN: are you high? this is a huge win for us.
ARCHIE GATES: running the press pool's a real big win for me.
GENERAL PYE: you want us to kill more americans to occupy iraq?
ARCHIE GATES: i'm just saying it's ironic, that's all.
GENERAL HORN: what the is ironic?
ARCHIE GATES: we got the biggest army in the world here but iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that's how the world works i guess.
GENERAL PYE: just take care of smithson and maybe he'll hook you up to consult on movies.
GENERAL HORN: it's either that or be a security guard when you retire.
ARCHIE GATES: you, ron.
GENERAL HORN: i'm a general now, you can't say you to me.
ARCHIE GATES: ok, sir, but there's another thing i'd like to say, if you don't mind.
GENERAL HORN: go right ahead, colonel.
ARCHIE GATES: fuuuuuck yooouuuu, ronnnnn.

TROY: you've washed your hands like a thousand times, conrad. 
VIG: lord knows what vermin live in the of a dune koon.
DOC: why do you let this cracker follow you around?
TROY: he's a good kid.
DOC: he's a wall-eyed cracker.
TROY: he's got no high school, man, he's from a group home in jackson --
DOC: i don't give a if he's from johannesburg. i don't want to hear dune koon or sand from him or anybody.
VIG: captain uses those terms.
TROY: the point is, conrad, 'towel head' and 'camel jockey' are perfectly good substitutes.
DOC: exactly.
VIG: i'm sorry, man, it's a little confusing is all.
DOC: what can i do for your headache?
TROY: got any vicadan?
DOC: all gone. how about caffergot?
TROY: excellent. let's translate my iraqi map.
TROY: van meter's at the big pow wow?
DOC: we're cool for at least three hours, but keep walter on the door.
TROY: would you take those things off?
WALTER: i never got to use night vision.
TROY: they don't work during the day and stand outside the tent.
DOC: these are definitely saddam's bunkers near karbala.
TROY: what's inside?
DOC: according to intelligence -- picasso, armani, rolex, mercedes, sony you name it -- kuwait was muslim beverly hills and saddam sacked it.
VIG: man, get an awesome stereo system with like ten bos speakers --
TROY: silver lexus convertible.
DOC: lexus doesn't make a convertible.
TROY: yes, they do.
DOC: infiniti has one coming.
TROY: you're wrong.
DOC: you can't get a car home from here anyway.
TROY: if i get enough rolexes i could buy one when i got home.
VIG: one gold rolex, i get a very fine split level outside jackson.
TROY: my one problem, see, is the risk here --
DOC: what risk? we already did the risk. i signed up last year to bank some computer training--
TROY: tell me about it.
DOC: next thing i know i'm sitting here waiting to get hit by a scud. i put my life on the line for what purpose i'm not sure, and now the good lord puts this map in my path --
TROY: he could put a land mine in your path if we try to find this place --
DOC: you're safe with me.
TROY: cuz you have a galactic plutonium forcefield.
DOC: i don't talk about it. but i do have a ring of fire.
TROY: you have a ring of fire.
DOC: i was fire baptized.
VIG: i was baptized in water.
DOC: i'm fire baptized.
TROY: i don't even know what water baptism means.
DOC: for those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't, no explanation will suffice. you can benefit from my ring if you do right by me, you got that?

WALTER: this tent is restricted -- 
ARCHIE GATES: get the out of my way.
WALTER: may day, may day --

ARCHIE GATES: good afternoon. 
ARCHIE GATES: would this be the proctology tent?
DOC: yes, sir, i mean, no, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: then maybe it's the urology tent.
TROY: captain's at a staff meeting.
ARCHIE GATES: that's ok, i'm not looking for a proctologist or a urologist i'm looking for sargeant barlow.
ARCHIE GATES: you're on the path to truth when you smell isn't that what they say?
VIG: i don't recognize you, sir. are you in this division?
DOC: he's not in this division. he's special forces.
DOC: he's the guy taking bill smithson around.
ARCHIE GATES: and you would be the three wise men, right, mappy, slappy, and pappy --
ARCHIE GATES: that leaves cappy outside.

VIG: his name is walter. 
ARCHIE GATES: did you good soldiers present this map to captain van meter?
TROY: not yet.
ARCHIE GATES: then i'll take it to him.
TROY: we'll take it to him. sir.
ARCHIE GATES: it won't do either of us any good then, will it?
TROY: he's our commander, sir. we'd have to tell him you took it.
ARCHIE GATES: it could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one eye-raqi to another --
TROY: it's a series of bunkers near karbala.
ARCHIE GATES: maybe.
TROY: not maybe, definitely. recon photos match the map.
ARCHIE GATES: may i look at the map?
VIG: dag.
ARCHIE GATES: that's what makes rangers badass, we get the best flashlights.
ARCHIE GATES: still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages. a bit farther to the west.
DOC: seventy-five klicks north.
ARCHIE GATES: more like 65.
TROY: much closer to karbala.
ARCHIE GATES: leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal. of course -- he turns the overhead light back on.
ARCHIE GATES: -- there could be nothing inside but starving arabs and stolen watches, but i think it's worth checking out, even if i have to do it with clueless reservists like you.
ARCHIE GATES: i mean, i could take the map, but you could talk, it starts to become a pain in the for me, so we'll do the gold together.
DOC: what gold?
ARCHIE GATES: you don't even know what's inside these bunkers, do you?
VIG: rolexes.
ARCHIE GATES: rolexes are swell, but i'm talking about kuwaiti bullion.
VIG: you mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup?
ARCHIE GATES: no. not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup.
TROY: gold bricks.
ARCHIE GATES: 5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's market.
VIG: for one gold brick?
ARCHIE GATES: i'm sure mr. hussein has divided his bricks. into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs. unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs.

VIG: i don't really have a day job. 
TROY: what about the risk of taking a humvee and all that --
ARCHIE GATES: we do this all the time.
VIG: what else did you do, sir?
ARCHIE GATES: in panama we went sailing in noriega's boats.
TROY: wow.
ARCHIE GATES: in vietnam, we got a big gold buddha, which we unfortunately dropped in a swamp by accident.
DOC: what about iraqi soldiers?
ARCHIE GATES: let's see. they had the bombed out them for two months, they're deserting all over the place, and they've completely surrendered to us. that's a beaten army in every sense of the word.
ARCHIE GATES: you are now under my command, salute --
ARCHIE GATES: what's the guy's name outside?
TROY: walter.

WALTER: how am i gonna get out of the company? 
ARCHIE GATES: your captain will be detained by a friend of mine.
VIG: is it true you got to take an enemy ear to be special forces?
ARCHIE GATES: no, but if you talk to anybody about this, i'll kill you.

CAPTAIN VAN METER: how about if i lean on it, like this? 
CATHY DAITCH: very dashing.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: does it look too posed?
CATHY DAITCH: would you ever stand like that?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: i think i might, this feels stupid.
CATHY DAITCH: you'll get used to it. first question: did you dream as a boy you'd be commanding an infantry company in a desert war?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: as a boy, i wanted to be either a veterinarian or a cia sharpshooter --

DOC: what are you talking about? 
TROY: i threw the ball in a higher arc that was easier for you to hit.
DOC: 
VIG: blacks make better receivers than quarterbacks.
TROY: stop speaking right now, conrad.
DOC: warren moon is an excellent quarterback.
VIG: the oilers have gone nowhere behind warren moon.
DOC: randall cunningham.
TROY: don't get down in the mud with him, doc.
VIG: the eagles will never get to the superbowl with him.
DOC: doug williams took the redskins to the superbowl and won, ok?

ARCHIE GATES: when we pull up to the bunker, the approach is something called violence of action, which is standard in special operations. it means your movement is so fast and decisive that the guards are frozen and we haven't fired a single shot. 
TROY: 
ARCHIE GATES: we dropped a lot of bombs out here and we buried some guys alive --
VIG: what do you mean?
ARCHIE GATES: bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the trenches --

ARCHIE GATES: we'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker. we pull up fast, and stop short. 
TROY: got it.
ARCHIE GATES: and --
DOC: it's all cow, i think.
VIG: yeah, it's all cow.
DOC: they said this was swept for mines.
ARCHIE GATES: mines are forever, doc. they never get all of 'em.
TROY: 'if you could, help me rhonda, help help me rhonda --' archie watches troy.
ARCHIE GATES: did you guys see any action at all?
VIG: only night bombing on cnn, except for troy's supercool shooting that guy in the neck--
ARCHIE GATES: is sepsis cool?
VIG: what's sepsis?
DOC: infection of the blood.
ARCHIE GATES: as in septic tank, because that's what happens when a bullet hits you. the lead tears in there --

ARCHIE GATES: but other than a wound that blinds, paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound i've ever seen is something called tension pneumo thorax -- 
DOC: i heard something about that --
VIG: tension pneumo what?
ARCHIE GATES: a bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon. and that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart. your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time -- kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once told.
DOC: that's not fatal, they can stop it.
ARCHIE GATES: if you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an overinflated tire.
TROY: can we play the beach boys when we go in?
DOC: the beach boys.
TROY: i'm not ashamed of liking the beach boys. it calms me down.
ARCHIE GATES: bach.

VIG: we are the army of the united states of america. we are here to protect you. remain calm. 
IRAQI MOTHER: no milk. baby milk.

FRIENDLY IRAQI: no problem, my friend. 
FRIENDLY IRAQI: you look for the chemical weapon?
TROY: no. we look for the gold.

DOC: i'm all right, i'm cool. 
ARCHIE GATES: discriminating use of violence as a last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that's what i learned, that's what i'm good at. but now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people.
TROY: i don't even know what happened back there. civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring
VIG: what exactly is a shiite?
ARCHIE GATES: they make up the ethnic majority but they don't have any power. when bush pulled us out, he told them to start a civil war to bring saddam down, and now they're getting wasted.
VIG: the civil war? how could it be the civil war?

BACK TO THE SCENE: vig looks puzzled. 
TROY: it's a war inside the same country, conrad. that's a civil war.
ARCHIE GATES: put these on, we are now u.s.
TROY: i can't do this, ok? because i've got a family and if i in a bag the rest of my life cuz i got shot
TROY: what the are you talking about?
ARCHIE GATES: what is it?
TROY: did you hear anything i said.
VIG: respect is the most important.
ARCHIE GATES: too dependent on other people.
DOC: money.
ARCHIE GATES: comes and goes, man.
TROY: what is this
DOC: what's the most important thing?
ARCHIE GATES: necessity. that's what dictates what will happen at any given time in life. necessity says we don't spend american lives taking out saddam, which leaves saddam the necessity of taking out the shiites so he can stay in power, which leaves us to take the gold.
TROY: we could've been shot.

VIG: rock and roll. 
TROY: ok. and i'll be wearing fashionable kevlar. as a necessity.

BILL SMITHSON: i'm at some marsh, all we've seen are russian cranes. 
WALTER: pelicans.
BILL SMITHSON: i think the saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, al. let's grow some and do the shiite uprising, for christ's sake.
BILL SMITHSON: we're going north to do the shiites.
WALTER: i thought the gold was the hot spot.
BILL SMITHSON: karbala's the new hotspot, and i'm driving.
WALTER: military regulations, you cannot drive.
WALTER: don't make me shoot you, sir.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: the m-16 is the basic weapon of the infantry. during vietnam, it was fully automatic.
GENERAL HORN: doug?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: yes, general.
GENERAL HORN: what the are you doing?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: well, i'm giving an interview to

GENERAL HORN: do you have authorization? 
GENERAL HORN: no.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: no?
GENERAL HORN: who gave you this?
CAPTAIN VAN METER: major gates.
GENERAL HORN: archie gates gave you this? christ, doug, come with me.
CAPTAIN VAN METER: i don't get to do the interview?
GENERAL HORN: no, you don't get to do the interview.

ARCHIE GATES: never hit anyone with your pistol, doc. 
DOC: sorry about that.
IRAQI CAPTAIN: for wife.
ARCHIE GATES: i've been divorced three times.
RIFLE IRAQI #2: newest and best.
TROY: no, newest and best has better noise reduction.
TROY: less distortion. get down on the floor, ok?
TROY: this is bad music, understand?
DOC: hey --
ARCHIE GATES: where's the gold, captain? tell us so we don't have to kill you.
TROY: there's another room over here.

IRAQI SARGEANT: i am just do my job, buddy. 
INTERROGATOR: these shiite. iraq problem. united states is out now.
INTERROGATOR: we take them outside, so it don't bother you, ok, sir?

VIG: don't start this again. 
VIG: i know ya'll shiite gettin' yer whipped -- hey, what the is going on here?
VIG: git on the ground, arab.
IRAQI SARGEANT: prisoner stay. gabar matan.
VIG: what the are you talking about?

IRAQI CAPTAIN: it's my ass, donkey dick, saddam will shoot me dead. 
INTERROGATOR: saddam worries more about the shiite than the gold.

INTERROGATOR: shut up, he signed the treaty. 
ARCHIE GATES: listen to me: we leave you alone to kill your shiites, but everything you took from kuwait, that belongs to us now, understand?
ARCHIE GATES: put it back.
DOC: why?
ARCHIE GATES: stick to the plan. the plan is for gold.
TROY: is this five kilos?
ARCHIE GATES: yeah, that's five kilos.
TROY: five, six, seven, eight, there's sixty bricks in this suitcase.
DOC: times 50k each --
TROY: three million dollars.
ARCHIE GATES: ten suitcases; sixty bricks each. that's thirty million dollars.
TROY: i'm gonna get a fleet of lexus convertibles in different colors.
DOC: i told you lexus doesn't make a convertible.
TROY: i'll bet you a lexus they do.
DOC: ok, you're on for a lexus, but it won't be a convertible.
TROY: 
ARCHIE GATES: they didn't get it here in these bags.
DOC: the tensilary strength goes to 200 pounds.
TROY: the what?
DOC: tensilary strength, it's what the suitcase can hold.
ARCHIE GATES: why would you know that?
TROY: he works at an airport.
DOC: 60 bars, 13 pounds each is like -- 800 pounds. the smaller vuittons handle 65.
ARCHIE GATES: you got any more luggage here?

ARCHIE GATES: it's crazy to take it all, we're not prepared for it. it's crazy not to take it all, how can we leave it? 
TROY: what's the shipping plan?
ARCHIE GATES: i told you that's handled.
TROY: how is it handled? you have to tell us now.
DOC: yeah, tell us now.
ARCHIE GATES: i've got a friend, he's in french special forces. he's gonna put it in barrels filled with oil and bury it. in a few weeks, he'll drive it to yanbu --
TROY: where's yanbu?
ARCHIE GATES: it's a port in saudi.

TROY: i don't know about getting them to baltimore, but these hat boxes ain't gonna fit in the humvee. 
ARCHIE GATES: we need a trailer.
TROY: ok, i'll call u-haul in karbala to see what they have on the lot today.
ARCHIE GATES: see what you can get, barlow.
TROY: conrad, we need a trailer --
VIG: did you get it? troy, did you get it?
TROY: yeah, we got it.
VIG: is it a lot?
TROY: yeah, it's a lot.

TROY: 'little deuce coupe with a fiat head mill, she'll walk a thunderbird like it's standin' still --' 
TROY: 'she'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored --'
TROY: 'she's my little deuce coupe --'

ARCHIE GATES: we take the kuwaiti gold. yes. 
IRAQI MAJOR: saddam cannot keep.
ARCHIE GATES: no, saddam cannot keep.
IRAQI MAJOR: saddam have too many problem today.
ARCHIE GATES: he certainly does.
IRAQI MAJOR: you need help to load?
ARCHIE GATES: we can do it ourselves.
IRAQI MAJOR: hazal jarat finan.
IRAQI MAJOR: these man help you.
INTERROGATOR: you go away fast from this archie looks at one soldier's hands.
ARCHIE GATES: let's load up and get out of here.

TROY: lay that one flat; ok, sideways -- 
ARCHIE GATES: this isn't gonna work.
TROY: sure it is --
IRAQI MAJOR: you need a truck.
ARCHIE GATES: we'll rig two carts.
TROY: let's take the truck.
ARCHIE GATES: we're not taking their truck.
TROY: why not?
IRAQI MAJOR: we cooperate with peace accord.
TROY: let's take the truck. archie looks vaguely disgusted. troy backs the truck up.
IRAQI MAJOR: nazaran yafit haisul.
INTERROGATOR: you get your kick in a war, it feel good to be strong again.
ARCHIE GATES: what did you say?
IRAQI MAJOR: you go now, please.
ARCHIE GATES: i don't think so. i'm sure you know about the geneva convention, right?
INTERROGATOR: geneva convention? you bomb my house, man.
IRAQI MAJOR: that shiite man is leader of uprising. he kill my man.
TROY: archie, let's stick to the plan, sir. the plan is for gold, right?
DOC: we can help them first, then be on our way.
TROY: no, we can't. it's not what we're here for.
ARCHIE GATES: how much?
IRAQI MAJOR: what?
ARCHIE GATES: how much gold do you want to let these people come with us?
INTERROGATOR: cannot do.
ARCHIE GATES: what do you mean, cannot do? i'm offering you a lot of money.
IRAQI MAJOR: cannot let shiite go --
INTERROGATOR: saddam kill us.
IRAQI MAJOR: saddam kill to me if we let them go, ok? now you go.
ARCHIE GATES: cover me.
TROY: christ, we can't save everybody.
ARCHIE GATES: are you listening? i said cover me.
VIG: yes, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: because we know what bullets do to vital organs, don't we?
VIG: make infected pockets filled with bile, sir.
ARCHIE GATES: that's right, that's what they do.
ARCHIE GATES: no shooting.

ARCHIE GATES: doc. 
DOC: down.
IRAQI SOLDIER: kazal stan hamir in fatar.
ARCHIE GATES: put the shiites in the humvee.

VIG: grenade launcher, sir. 
ARCHIE GATES: no. let's get out of here.

WIDE AERIAL SHOT: the truck is 60 yards behind the humvee
ARCHIE GATES: what's the tank doing?

ARCHIE GATES: don't do it, this isn't sarin. 
DOC: is it mustard?
ARCHIE GATES: it's c.s.
DOC: what's that?
ARCHIE GATES: tear gas times ten, but it's not lethal. where's barlow?
DOC: i don't know.

VIG: what's going on? 
DOC: get in the tunnel.

IRAQI SOLDIER: can we shoot him? 
IRAQI SOLDIER #2: we're not even supposed to have american prisoners.
INTERROGATOR: he's proof they broke the cease- fire.

BILL SMITHSON: start shooting, paco. 
WALTER: i don't like this, we gotta go-- iraqi soldiers pull them off the motorcycle.

TROY: um. do you speak english? 
OPERATOR: yes.
TROY: can you -- i need --
OPERATOR: what number, please.
TROY: operation desert storm.
OPERATOR: i'm sorry?
TROY: the big army in the desert, come on, it's an emergency.

TROY: maybe you could -- hello?
TROY: 
TROY: come on, come on, come on.

DARLENE: hello? 
TROY: honey, it's me.
DARLENE: troy?
TROY: it's me, honey.
DARLENE: my the baby's crying.
TROY: i can hear her.
DARLENE: that's our little krystal.
TROY: how's she doing?
DARLENE: she hasn't been sleeping good, and mamma had to go back to work, so i'm real, real tired, baby.
TROY: i wish i was there to help, gooney- bird.
DARLENE: oh, gooney-bird, when are you coming home?

VIG: i'm sorry i hit you, man. i was scared for troy, i don't want nothing to happen to him, he's my friend. doc? come on, man, i know you was comin' to help me --
VIG: maybe we got kicked out of the ring of fire, on account of stealing.
DOC: that's not how it works.
VIG: how does it work?
DOC: i take care of what puts in front of me. that's what we did with the gold.
VIG: what about now?
DOC: i'm gonna see.
ARCHIE GATES: how you doing, conrad?
VIG: i'm good to go, chief.
ARCHIE GATES: let's check the suitcases.
DOC: we're missing 28.
ARCHIE GATES: that leaves 92 suitcases, five bars each -- they think.
ARCHIE GATES: 23 million dollars. not bad for a disaster, provided we can find barlow, get back before dark and not get busted.
ARCHIE GATES: it was my choice today. so you can head back if you want. i'll find barlow myself.
DOC: what about the gold?
ARCHIE GATES: take what you can carry. try to find a vehicle. bury what you have outside camp. be careful about it.
VIG: i want to find troy.
DOC: i'm in.
ARCHIE GATES: ok, where does that leave us? we don't have any water, we're dehydrated. you got a radio here?
ARCHIE GATES: how is she?
DOC: how -- is -- your -- little girl?
VIG: broken -- arms. girl.
MAN IN GLASSES: she's traumatized, what the do you expect?
MAN IN GLASSES: i went to b-school at bowling green.

ARCHIE GATES: you got a radio? 
MAN IN GLASSES: no radio. no water.
ARCHIE GATES: where's barlow?
MAN IN GLASSES: they got him, i saw it happen. and they won't take him back to the same place.
ARCHIE GATES: where would they take him?
MAN IN GLASSES: oasis bunker. it's full of saddam's hard core guys.
DOC: where's that?
MAN IN GLASSES: like 17 - 18 klicks from here.
ARCHIE GATES: take us there.
MAN IN GLASSES: we got no wheels.
ARCHIE GATES: we'll walk until we find some.
MAN IN GLASSES: why don't you call in the marines?
ARCHIE GATES: with what? we don't have a radio.
MAN IN GLASSES: ok, we'll find a vehicle. you drive back to get the choppers, they fly in to get your man.
ARCHIE GATES: we can't do that.
MAN IN GLASSES: why not? you got a huge army here.
ARCHIE GATES: we're not supposed to be involved with shiites. we killed iraqi soldiers. we broke the peace- accord.
MAN IN GLASSES: tell them it happened when you reclaimed the gold. don't tell them it was about us.
ARCHIE GATES: they'd find out, we'd go to jail.
MAN IN GLASSES: you know what i think? i think maybe you're boosting the gold. that's what i think.
ARCHIE GATES: you're wrong.
MAN IN GLASSES: they got half a million men in the desert, they send four guys to pick up all this bullion? i don't think so.
ARCHIE GATES: we need to find our man. how much do you want to take us there?
MAN IN GLASSES: fifteen suitcases.
ARCHIE GATES: that's too much.
VIG: give it to him. we've got a lot.
ARCHIE GATES: we're gonna need it to buy our way back today, so we better spend it wisely. i'll give you eight.
MAN IN GLASSES: you need some guns, right? you lost your gear.
ARCHIE GATES: yeah, we need some guns.
MAN IN GLASSES: you need some fighters, too. i mean, you can try to take oasis on your own, but look at these grunts --
ARCHIE GATES: yeah, ok, we need some fighters.
MAN IN GLASSES: so that's worth more than eight suitcases.
ARCHIE GATES: ten.
MAN IN GLASSES: fifteen.
ARCHIE GATES: that's four million dollars.
MAN IN GLASSES: i think we need it more than you, john doe, don't you?
ARCHIE GATES: archie gates.
IMAM: imam katar. i'll give you back five suitcases to get us over the iranian border.
ARCHIE GATES: what?
IMAM: we gotta get to a refugee camp or we're dead. the camps are in iran.
DOC: we can't go to the iranian border.
IMAM: then we don't have a deal.

IMAM: and we saved yours. 
ARCHIE GATES: we lost a man for you.
IMAM: what good is it if you leave us to get wasted? the big army of democracy beats the ugly dictator, saves the rich kuwaitis, but you go to jail if you help us escape the same dictator. you saw what happened to my wife. look at my daughter.
ARCHIE GATES: who's going?
IMAM: everyone but the priests. that's

VIG: it. we'll find this place on our own. 
IMAM: it's not on a map. you can look.
DOC: somebody else will take us.

IMAM: i don't think so. 
VIG: this is a human life we're talking about.
IMAM: tell me about it.

TROY: right.
TROY: so why are you doing this to me?
INTERROGATOR: it's my job, man, for saddam, just like your job when you bomb my house.
TROY: it's not just a job, it still matters what you do.
INTERROGATOR: it's all a job.

INTERROGATOR: everyday, inside my heart --

FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: no. infiniti convertible only.
FRIENDLY IRAQI 2: no lexus convertible.
DOC: exactly what i said.
ARCHIE GATES: listen. we use these cars to go fight saddam soldiers.
DOC: what's so funny?
FRIENDLY IRAQI SOLDIER: cannot take.
DOC: what do you mean, cannot take? we kicked saddam's ass. we definitely take.
ARCHIE GATES: we are the united states military.
IMAM: you're three guys with a bunch of shiites and no humvee.

DOC: i'm cool. i'm all right.

INTERROGATOR: i know. 
TROY: i heard about some bad that happened there.

TROY: who's got the sick country? 
INTERROGATOR: maybe saddam is very crazy, right? and then you are crazy to bomb all of iraq.
TROY: too much bombing is crazy, but not saving kuwait.
INTERROGATOR: you come here to save kuwait people?
TROY: yes.
INTERROGATOR: really?
TROY: you invaded another country. you can't do that.
INTERROGATOR: why not, dude?
TROY: it makes the world crazy. you got to keep it stable.
INTERROGATOR: for what? your pick up truck?

TROY: ok, you choose who we take. you tell the others it's not convenient, they'll have to die.

TROY: you think i don't know what i'm saying. i know what i'm saying. we're gonna do more than steal, that's what i'm saying. we're gonna help these people out.
IMAM: this guy was worth saving.
