speaker1: let me get this straight. the girl with the 
speaker1: i mean, what is it with you catholics?
speaker2: all right. let's try to keep it constructive, shall we? howard, what about you?
speaker3: i hated it.
speaker2: that's not exactly what i meant by constructive, howard.
speaker3: i think james should try to be more
speaker2: yes, hannah?
speaker4: i think maybe we're missing the point. it
speaker2: well put, hannah. and a good note to end on, i think. don't forget about wordfest this weekend. and remember: those of you driving v.i.p.s to tonight's cocktail party need to have them at the chancellor's house no later than 5:30. hannah green gathers her things, pauses by grady.
speaker2: thanks for that. he all right?
speaker4: i think so. ..what about you?
speaker2: me? sure. why?
speaker4: just checking.
speaker5: turn out the light, please.

speaker1: professor tripp. 
speaker2: chancellor.
speaker1: i got the message you called.
speaker2: i got the message you called too.

speaker1: tripp! 
speaker2: how are you, crabtree?
speaker1: brimming. say hello to my new friend, miss antonia. . .uh. . . .
speaker3: sloviak.
speaker1: i took the liberty of inviting antonia to
speaker2: the more the merrier.
speaker4: terry was telling me about you on the plane. it was ail so interesting.
speaker1: i was explaining to antonia how a book comes to be published. what you do as a writer, what i do as an editor...
speaker2: i sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
speaker4: that's exactly what he said.
speaker1: we know each other pretty well. so where's emily?
speaker2: emily?
speaker1: your wife.
speaker2: oh. we're picking her up. downtown.
speaker1: perfect. well then, shall we?

speaker1: do you know how many times i've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? particularly while i'm on my way to pittsburgh. 
speaker2: lay off pittsburgh. it's one of the great cities.
speaker1: if it can produce a miss sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
speaker2: she's a transvestite.
speaker1: you're stoned.
speaker2: she's still a transvestite.
speaker1: mm.
speaker2: isn't she?
speaker1: so how's the book?
speaker2: it's fine. it's done. basically. i'm just sort of. ..tinkering with it.
speaker1: great. i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend. think that might be possible?
speaker2: i don't know. i'm sort of at a critical. . . juncture .
speaker1: i thought you were tinkering.
speaker2: i just mean. . .
speaker1: forget i asked. i don't want to pressure you, tripp. but... ...i get pressure. know what i mean?
speaker1: ah. ..well now. what do you suppose that would be?
speaker2: that would be a tuba.

speaker1: that perfume you're wearing, antonia. it wouldn't happen to be cristaile, would it? 
speaker2: why yes. how did you know?
speaker1: lucky guess.
speaker3: you didn't actually purchase this car, did you. trip??
speaker1: it was jerry nathan's. he owed me money.
speaker3: he owes money. you know, he queered himself for good with esquire.
speaker1: he said something about being between things.
speaker3: yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.

speaker1: hi, tanya. this is tanya. my wife's secretary. 
speaker2: grady.. ..emily's not here. grady just smiles, nods. tanya is there anything i can do for you?
speaker1: you're leaking, tanya.
speaker3: trip? ?
speaker1: she left me. crabs.
speaker3: left you...? who? emily?
speaker1: this morning. i found a note in the kitchen.
speaker3: but. ..why didn't you say something, tripp? i mean, what are we doing here? grady gazes at the glittering scene beyond his windshield, turns on the ignition.
speaker1: i thought maybe i made it all up.

speaker1: that's a nice greenhouse. 
speaker2: it's mrs. gaskell's. her hobby.
speaker3: i thought you were mrs. gaskell's hobby, tripp.
speaker2: off, crabs. i lost a wife today.
speaker3: oh, i'm sure you'll find another. you always do.

speaker1: well, hello, everyone. terry, good to see you again. 
speaker2: chancellor. don't you look ravishing.
speaker1: aren't you sweet to say so. i was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to--oh!
speaker3: easy there.
speaker1: i'm sorry. it's these shoes. i don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
speaker4: practice.
speaker1: i don't believe we've met...
speaker4: antonia. antonia sloviak--
speaker1: poe!
speaker4: who ' s he barking at now?
speaker3: he's still barking at me. he's blind.
speaker1: poe' hush! now stop this. honestly.
speaker3: i need to talk to you.
speaker1: that's funny. i need to talk to you, too. perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, professor tripp.
speaker3: i don't believe i know where the upstairs guest room is.
speaker1: well then. i'd better show you. terry--
speaker2: we'll just make ourselves at home. won't we, poe? yes, yes....

speaker1: new? 
speaker2: you go first.
speaker1: all right. this morning--
speaker2: i'm pregnant.
speaker2: i'm sure.
speaker1: well. this is...surprising. does walter... ?
speaker2: i think walter would find this a little more than surprising.
speaker1: emily left me this morning.
speaker2: she's left before...
speaker1: she's left the room before. she always came back. sara nods. considers this.
speaker2: so. i guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? simple.
speaker1: simple.
speaker2: is that cristaile?
speaker1: hm.
speaker2: my i wear the same scent as a transvestite. she is a transvestite, isn't: she?
speaker1: if she's not now, terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
speaker2: has he asked to see the book yet?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: and? are you going to tell him?
speaker1: no. maybe. i don't know. i don't know what i'm going to do.
speaker2: neither do 1.
speaker1: sara, my arm. i'm stuck, honey.
speaker2: i guess you're going to have to chew it off then.

speaker1: walter! i see you've met my friend. 
speaker2: yes . she' s charming.
speaker2: joe dimaggio. simply put, antonia, it' s my contention that their marriage tapped into the very id of american popular culture. joe dimaggio represented, metaphorically speaking, the husband as slugger.. and, though it may be controversial, i personally believe every woman, in some way, desires to be marilyn monroe.
speaker3: oh, i couldn't agree more.

speaker1: and while my latest has been on the new york times bestseller list for 40 weeks, i can't help but lament that my first book, which contains what i consider my finest writing, was remaindered in less than five. so, i find myself conflicted. 
speaker2: ask him if he's conflicted about his house in the hamptons.
speaker3: grady.
speaker1: hello.. .professor.
speaker2: q,. hannah's had two stories published in the paris review. you'd best dust off the 'a' material for her.
speaker2: hello, nathan.
speaker4: my i haven't seen you since, what? the pen/faulkner awards. that was a big night for you, grady. grady was there for arsonist's daughter,

speaker1: there you are. 
speaker2: i could swear i had a '63 chateau latour in here. you haven't seen it, have you?
speaker3: i doubt i'd recognize a '63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it.
speaker2: you'd recognize it if you tasted it.
speaker3: i doubt it, darling.
speaker3: you want to keep him happy.
speaker2: if he' s happy. . . i'm happy.
speaker4: james?
speaker5: it's fake.

speaker1: it was my mother's. she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school. 
speaker2: it's very convincing.
speaker1: it used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. the caps.
speaker1: it's just. ..for good luck. some people carry rabbits' feet...
speaker2: ...you carry firearms.
speaker1: no, thank you. i don't like to lose control of my emotions. grady nods, accustomed to james' weirdness.
speaker1: i'm not supposed to be here, in case you were wondering. i crashed. i mean, not intentionally...
speaker2: are you and hannah seeing each other, james ?
speaker1: no! what gave you that idea?
speaker2: relax, james. i'm not her father. i just rent her a room.
speaker1: she likes old movies like i do, that's ail. besides, she doesn't really know me. she thinks she does, but she doesn't. maybe it's because she's mormon and i'm catholic.
speaker2: maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way. james looks away from the window, at grady.
speaker1: you're not like my other teachers, professor tripp.
speaker2: you're not like my other students, james. so what was the movie you two saw?
speaker1: huh? oh. son or fury. with tyrone power and frances farmer.
speaker2: she went crazy, frances farmer.
speaker1: so did gene tierney. she's in it too.
speaker2: sounds like a good one.
speaker1: it's not bad.
speaker2: listen, james, about this afternoon. in
speaker1: they really hated it. i think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
speaker2: well...
speaker1: it doesn't matter. it only took me an hour to write.
speaker2: really? that's remarkable.
speaker1: i have trouble sleeping. while i'm lying in bed i figure them out. the stories.
speaker2: you cold, james?
speaker1: a little.
speaker2: so what are you doing out here?
speaker1: it's colder in there. -
speaker2: you're right.
speaker1: actually, i saw the greenhouse. so i thought ...i thought i'd come out here and take a look at it. you don't see one of those every day. it looks like heaven...
speaker2: heaven?
speaker1: i saw a movie once. part of it took place in heaven. everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. like that. at least that's the way i remember it... abruptly, james glances at his watch.
speaker1: i should be going.
speaker2: james. don't leave just yet. there's something i think you ought to see.
speaker1: i'll miss my bus.
speaker2: this is worth it. james looks conflicted. grady trust me.

speaker1: hey, you two. 
speaker2: no, i'm going ho--
speaker3: he's going with me. you take crabtree. and his friend. all right?
speaker1: ail right. by the way, his friend...?
speaker3: the answer's yes. i think. yes. i don't know. where are they exactly?
speaker4: here we are!
speaker4: nell, hello there.
speaker3: james. this is my editor, terry crabtree.
speaker1: james'll know about george sanders.
speaker2: george sanders?
speaker1: mr. crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
speaker2: pills. august 25, 1972. in a costa brava hotel room.
speaker4: how comprehensive of you.
speaker1: oh, james is amazing. he knows all the movie suicides. go ahead, james. tell them who else.
speaker2: there's so many...
speaker1: just a few then. the big ones.
speaker2: pier angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. charles boyer, 1978, pills again. charles butterworth, 1946, i think. in a car. supposedly it was an accident, but, you know. . . he was distraught. dorothy dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. albert dekker, 1968, he hung himself. he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. alan ladd, '64, more pills, carole landis, pills again, i forget when. george reeves, superman on tv, shot himself. jean seberg/ pills of course, 1979. everett sioane-- he was good--pills. margaret sullavan, pills, lupe velez, a lot of pills. gig young. he shot himself and his wife in 1978. there are more but i don't know if you would have heard of them. ross alexander? clara blandick? maggie mcnamara? gia scaia?
speaker1: i haven't heard of half of those.
speaker4: you did them alphabetically.
speaker2: that's just how my brain works, i guess.
speaker4: fascinating. listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. there's a place on the hill i always get trip to take me.
speaker2: actually. ..i just want to go home.
speaker4: oh, don't be silly. no one your age just wants to go home. besides, faculty will be present. just think of it as a field trip.

speaker1: is that really it? 
speaker2: that's really it.
speaker1: the one she wore on her wedding day?
speaker2: so i'm told.
speaker2: go ahead.
speaker1: really?
speaker2: really.
speaker1: they're glass. the buttons.
speaker2: like the lady herself.
speaker1: she was small. most people don't know that. the shoulders are small. it looks so perfect. i bet it's the only time she wore it. that day. she must've felt so ...happy.
speaker1: it's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. it must've cost dr. gaskell a lot.
speaker2: i guess. walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
speaker1: you're really good friends with the chancellor, aren't you?
speaker2: pretty good. i'm friends with dr. gaskell, too.
speaker1: i guess you must be, if you know the
speaker2: right.
speaker2: we, better skedaddle. close that closet-- james? you ail right?
speaker1: i'm sorry. professor tripp. maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. it just looks...really lonely. hanging there. in a closet. maybe i'm just a little sad.
speaker2: maybe. i'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
speaker1: you mean, with your wife leaving you and ail? hannah mentioned something about it. about a note.
speaker2: yes. well. it's complicated, james. i think we should go now.
speaker3: a low rumble freezes grady
speaker2: okay. easy now. eee-zy. . . .
speaker2: 
speaker2: get off of me, you

speaker1: james. you shoe dr. gaskell's dog. 
speaker2: i had to. didn't i?
speaker1: couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
speaker2: no! he was crazy. i didn't-he looked-- 1 thought --
speaker1: okay, okay. take it easy. don't freak out on me.
speaker2: do you have a mirror? it's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
speaker1: he's dead, james. believe me, i know a dead dog when i see one. james looks miserably at poe.
speaker2: what are we going to do?
speaker1: first you're going to give me that little cap gun of yours.

speaker1: professor tripp? can i ask you a question? 
speaker2: yea, james.
speaker1: what are we going to do with...
speaker2: i don't know. i'm still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husband's dog.
speaker1: you?
speaker2: trust me, james, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
speaker1: does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
speaker2: i've got tenure.

speaker1: okay. 
speaker2: he's still a little warm.
speaker2: yuck.
speaker2: that's a. big trunk. it fits a tuba, a
speaker2: whose tuba is that anyway?
speaker1: miss sloviak's.
speaker2: can i ask you something about her?
speaker1: she is. ah. here we go...
speaker2: oh. so. is--is your friend crabtree-- is he-- gay?
speaker1: most of the time he is, james. some of the time he isn't. now what do we have here?
speaker1: looks like ...our old friend mr. codeine. that should take the pinch out of my ankle. have one.
speaker2: no thanks. i'm fine without them.
speaker1: right. that's why you were standing in the
speaker1: i'm sorry, james. i'm sorry i said that.
speaker1: how 'bout we try that again.

speaker1: good evening. 
speaker1: i am a writer.
speaker2: i'll be right back.

speaker1: grady? grady? 
speaker2: you had another one, didn't you? you have to see a doctor, grady. first thing monday morning. all right?
speaker3: is the thing-is it over?
speaker2: almost. wane to sit up? what's the matter?
speaker3: nothing. i think i twisted my--
speaker3: i have to tell you something. something.. .hard.
speaker2: then stand up. i'm too old for all this roiling around on the floor.
speaker3: well...
speaker2: don't. i know what you're going to say.
speaker3: no, really, sara, i don't think you--
speaker2: you love emily. i know that. and you need to stay with her.
speaker3: i don't think i really have a choice in, that. emily left me.
speaker2: she'll come back. that's why i'm going to. ..to not have this baby.
speaker3: not have it.
speaker2: no. there's no way. i mean, don't you think there's no way?
speaker3: well, no, i don't see any way.
speaker2: who's gun is that?
speaker3: it's-it's a souvenir. of baltimore.
speaker2: heavy. smells like gunpowder.
speaker3: caps.
speaker2: pow.
speaker3: you got me.
speaker2: i love you, grady.
speaker3: i love you, too.

speaker1: woah! the doors made so much noise! 
speaker1: this is so embarrassing! you guys had to carry me out.
speaker2: is he ail right?
speaker3: he's fine. he's narrating.
speaker1: we're going to the men's room. only we might not make it in time.
speaker4: terry crabtree and james leer. leave it to you to make that mistake, wait here.
speaker5: i need a ride.
speaker2: i'm your man.

speaker1: couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing? 
speaker2: james is. ..i don't know...
speaker1: disturbed. and when your friend crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
speaker2: i'm not sure that's possible.
speaker1: sure it is.
speaker2: listen, antonia--
speaker1: tony. now that i'm home.
speaker2: tony. i'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. with terry.
speaker1: forget it. i should've known better. your friend is just, i don't know, into collecting weird tricks. mind? tony angles the rearview mirror toward himself.
speaker2: he's writing his name in water.
speaker1: what's that?
speaker2: like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
speaker1: that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a
speaker2: he'd call it habit. but now. ..i get the
speaker1: you mean because his career's ruined and all?
speaker2: is that what he told you?
speaker1: he said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in new york thinks he's kind of .a. . .
speaker1: ...loser. but i'm sure your book is so good that he'll be able to keep his job.
speaker1: turn here.

speaker1: that'' s nice. all we have is a japanese beetle trap. 
speaker2: it's a bathtub. what she's standing under.
speaker2: there's pop. let me see it. the gun.
speaker2: figures. it's like the kind of gun bette davis would carry. in a little beaded purse?
speaker1: i'd better go. i think i may have to rescue james leer.
speaker2: you know, grady, if i were you. i'd think about going home. you look like you need a little rescuing yourself.

speaker1: clean tonight, hub, professor? 
speaker2: as a whistle.

speaker1: is that just beer? 
speaker2: primarily. although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia. you missed a few bottles, by the way.
speaker1: i'm sure. where is everyone?
speaker2: sara and walter declined. guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
speaker1: he's out.
speaker2: he has a book.
speaker1: i know. he started it fall semester.
speaker2: he finished it winter break.
speaker2: so. is he any good?
speaker1: no. not yet he isn't.
speaker2: well, i'm going to read it anyway.
speaker1: come on. crabs. don't do this. he's . one oâ£ my students, for christ sake. i'm not even sure if he's-
speaker2: he is. take my word for it.
speaker1: i think it's more complicated than that.
speaker2: on the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.
speaker3: double dickel.
speaker1: thanks.
speaker2: no sexual confusion there, eh, professor?
speaker1: shut up and drink.
speaker2: oh my goodness. do you see what i see?
speaker1: president of the james brown hair club for men.
speaker1: he's a boxer. a flyweight.
speaker2: huh uh. a jockey. his name's, um, curtis.. .curtis hardapple.
speaker1: not curtis.
speaker2: vernon, then. vernon hardapple. the scar's are from a--from a horse. he fell during a race and got trampled.
speaker1: and now he's addicted to painkillers.
speaker2: he can't standing up anymore.
speaker1: he lives with his mother.
speaker2: and he had a younger brother who . . .was . . . a. . .
speaker1: groom. named claudell. and his mother blames vernon for his death.
speaker2: because. . .because. . .
speaker4: vernon, over there, was in on the hit.
speaker2: that was good.
speaker1: he heard everything we were saying.
speaker5: come on. teach. i want you to dance with me.

speaker1: i've been re-reading arsonist's daughter. it's so beautiful, grady. so natural. it's like ail your sentences always existed, just waiting around in style heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down. 
speaker2: i thank you.
speaker1: and i love the inscription you wrote to me. only i'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am.
speaker2: i hope that isn't true. we need all the downy innocents we can get. grady spies the corner table, watches crabtree say
speaker1: so what are you going to do?
speaker2: do?
speaker1: i just mean, i--i guess emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
speaker2: are you holding me up or am i dragging you down?
speaker1: shush.

speaker1: look, hannah. when you get him home ...make sure he's ail right. before you leave. okay? 
speaker2: i would if i knew where i was taking him.
speaker1: hannah, are you telling me you don't know where james leer lives?
speaker2: some apartment somewhere. but i've never seen it.
speaker1: that strikes me as odd.
speaker2: james is odd. i know he has an aunt in sewickley heights. i dropped him there once, but... come to think of it, it-wasn't even his aunt's house. he said she worked there. or something. i don't remember.
speaker3: mmhmmm.. . . knap ...sap....
speaker1: what's he saying?
speaker2: his bag. you know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. he must've left it inside.
speaker1: hh-uh. last time i saw it was...
speaker4: and q huddle inside.
speaker1: he must've left it back at thaw. in the auditorium.
speaker3: mmrrmmm.. .knap sap!
speaker2: the one in your office? it's the best one .for naps.
speaker1: i don't think it really matters, hannah. we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
speaker1: ail right. in my office.
speaker2: hey. if you want to talk later...i'll be up.
speaker5: you driving this car?
speaker1: excuse me?
speaker5: this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500. you driving this car?
speaker1: it's mine.
speaker5: it's mine, motherfucker.
speaker1: you must be mistaken.
speaker5: 
speaker1: go home to your mother, vernon.

speaker1: all right, what's the matter? 
speaker1: christ, crabs, what do you expect me to do? the kid's practically in a coma.
speaker2: tripp.
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: hit your brakes.
speaker3: oh my what is that?
speaker1: what's this guy's problem?
speaker2: just go around him.
speaker1: 
speaker2: back up. go out the other way.
speaker1: now what?
speaker3: what just happened?
speaker1: i just had my car jumped on.

speaker1: wait here. i'll be right back. 
speaker2: where would we go?

speaker1: it's open. grady pushes on the door and it opens. janitor hey, professor tripp. traxler. sam. i took your class freshman year. then i dropped out of school. 
speaker2: i hope it wasn't my fault.
speaker3: no. i guess you're here for the backpack.
speaker2: oh.. .yeah.

speaker1: i saw the manuscript inside. so when you showed up, i figured. . . 
speaker1: is it good?
speaker2: i don't know. it might be...

speaker1: say, professor tripp, is ail that stuff true about errol flynn? how he used to put coke on his to make himself, you know, like, last longer? 
speaker2: christ, traxler. how the should i know?
speaker1: well, jeez, you're reading his biography, aren't you?
speaker2: oh, right. yeah, that's true. he used to rub ail kinds of things on it. paprika. ground lamb.
speaker1: sick.

speaker1: wow, check out that greenhouse. is that your wife? 
speaker2: no, my wife's out of town.
speaker2: her husband.
speaker1: what exactly are we doing here, professor tripp?
speaker2: taking the long way home.

speaker1: thank you. 
speaker2: you're welcome.
speaker2: james i
speaker2: i'm okay. i just lost my balance.
speaker1: i put you on the floor.
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: i thought you might--l don't know-- swallow your tongue or something. i guess you really miss her, huh?
speaker2: huh? oh, no. this isn't emily's. i just write in it.
speaker1: i guess there's probably a story behind that.
speaker2: there is, but it's not that interesting.

speaker1: want me to get that? 
speaker2: sure.
speaker1: he didn't give his name.
speaker2: who?
speaker1: the guy on the phone.
speaker2: what'd he say?
speaker1: he wanted to know if a grady trip? lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 ford galaxie 500 with black interior.
speaker2: what'd you tell him?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: good, james. if the zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
speaker1: i thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. is that single-spaced?
speaker2: afraid so.
speaker1: that's a big book you're writing.
speaker2: i think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
speaker1: wow, hannah always swore you were working, but--
speaker2: but . . . ?
speaker1: nothing, it's just that,, well, it's been awhile since arsonist's daughter, and some people--some of the kids in workshop--thought maybe you were...
speaker2: washed up?
speaker1: blocked.
speaker2: ah. i don't believe in writer's block.
speaker1: no kidding.
speaker3: good morning, boys. james.
speaker1: professor tripp?
speaker2: hm.
speaker1: how did i get here last night?
speaker2: no one seems to know where you live, james. hannah thought you'd like my couch.
speaker1: and ...and before that. did i do anything? anything bad?
speaker2: well, james, you did shoot the head of the english department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
speaker2: do yourself a favor, james ...hide.

speaker1: grady is scratching his head in mock thought. 
speaker2: well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but i can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious. ..wait. there was one guy. tiny fella. claimed to be a jockey.
speaker3: a jockey? you mean, like--
speaker2: horses, right. vernon something... hardpple pupcik stops on his pad, looks up.
speaker3: hardapple?
speaker2: i could be wrong. what happened anyway?
speaker3: huh? oh, someone pulled a bande on dr. gaskell's closet. and the dog's missing.
speaker2: that's weird.
speaker3: we figure the perpetrator let him out. he's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
speaker2: the perpetrator.
speaker3: no, the dog.
speaker2: just kidding.
speaker3: one other thing. about this kid, this student of yours- leer--james leer. you wouldn't know how i could get in touch with him, would you?
speaker2: i might have his number on campus.
speaker3: that's all right. we'll find him.
speaker4: there you are...
speaker4: i thought we were going to talk. last night.
speaker2: oh. well. i...
speaker4: it's okay. ..i'm here when you want me.
speaker5: what do we do now?

speaker1: hello? 
speaker2: grady, it's sara. thank you're there. you won't believe what's happened.
speaker1: could you hold on a minute, honey?
speaker1: how 'bout we get the out of here?

speaker1: you start her up. 
speaker2: how's that?
speaker1: well done, james.
speaker2: you're bleeding. professor tripp.

speaker1: where exactly do you live, james? 
speaker1: apparently not even hannah green has a clue as to the location of your apartment.
speaker2: i got kicked out. well, not exactly kicked out. i was asked to leave.
speaker1: i guess there's probably a story behind that.
speaker2: there is, but it's not that interesting.
speaker1: so where have you been staying?
speaker2: the bus station.
speaker2: it's not -so bad. i know the night janitor. and there's a broken locker i can put my stuff.
speaker1: but james. i mean. ..how long?
speaker2: a couple weeks. that's why... that's why i had the gun. for protection.
speaker1: james, you should've told someone.
speaker2: who?
speaker1: i don't know... me.

speaker1: isn't this...? 
speaker2: hm.
speaker2: you better ease off that stuff, james. it's pretty acidic.
speaker1: i can't help myself. i don't know what's the matter with me.
speaker2: james, you're hungover. what do you think's the matter with you?

speaker1: totally. i'm sorry. a lot was happening this morning. can you talk? sara nods, moves the ficus to another table. 
speaker2: walter's on campus, being the good soldier for wordfest. but he's a basket case. someone stole marilyn's jacket last night. and poe's missing, too.
speaker1: i-heard.
speaker2: you heard? how?
speaker1: a twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
speaker2: did you confess?
speaker2: your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
speaker1: really? that was fast.
speaker2: i'm kidding. hello?
speaker1: oh. right. ha. listen, about last night. there is something i need to tell...
speaker2: are you limping? why are you limping?
speaker1: hub? oh, well, that's part of what i need to .

speaker1: did you pass out again, grady? did you fall somewhere? 
speaker2: no. i mean. well, actually, yes. sort of. i don't remember. listen, sara, i have to tell you something.
speaker1: all right.

speaker1: gee, grady, that sounded so heartfelt. i don't know whether to swoon or smirk. 
speaker2: really, sara, i...
speaker1: i believe you. i believe you want to be with me. but this is not just about me anymore.
speaker2: i know that. i know what's at stake here...
speaker1: no, i don't think you do. and besides... i haven't decided yet.
speaker2: about the baby.
speaker1: that ...and you.
speaker1: i'm not going to draw the map for you on this one, grady. times like these you have to do your own navigating.
speaker1: who's that sitting in your car?
speaker2: james leer.
speaker1: what's he doing out there?
speaker2: i'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
speaker1: isn't he lucky.

speaker1: she seemed to take it pretty well. 
speaker2: yeah, well, actually. . . james looks over. grady
speaker2: don't be proud, james. we're in sewickley heights. we could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
speaker1: no.
speaker2: your aunt ?
speaker1: humboldt county?
speaker2: maybe...
speaker1: it's my father. he gets it from his doctor.
speaker2: glaucoma?
speaker1: colon cancer.
speaker2: james. wow.

speaker1: where's that? 
speaker2: carvel.
speaker1: carvel? where's carvel?
speaker2: outside scranton.
speaker1: i never heard of it.
speaker2: it's a hellhole. three motels and a mannequin factory. my dad worked there for thirty-five years.
speaker1: your father worked in a mannequin factory?
speaker2: seitz plastics. that's where he met my morn. she was a fry cook in the cafeteria. before that, she'd been a dancer.
speaker1: what kind of dancer? .
speaker2: whatever kind they wanted her to be.
speaker2: i'm telling you what i was told by my uncle. and he should know. he ran half a dozen men's clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
speaker1: didn't you say your mom went to catholic school?
speaker2: when we fall, we fall hard.
speaker1: amazing.
speaker2: maybe i just needed the moment to present itself.

speaker1: this is so nice. it's like where andy hardy would live. what's it called again? 
speaker2: kinship.
speaker1: kinship. and what's here?
speaker2: unless i miss my bet...my wife.
speaker1: the one that left you?
speaker2: that's right. that one.

speaker1: someone jumped on your car with their ..- 
speaker2: how can you tell?
speaker1: you can see the outline of a as grady nods, james holds out the donut box. james leer want one. they're incredible. incredible.
speaker2: smoke the rest of that joint, james, and you can start on the box.

speaker1: maybe she didn't come here. 
speaker2: she came here. we'll just wait. in the meantime, i need you to shimmy through.
speaker2: relax. emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. and your hips are as slim as hers.
speaker1: it's not that. it just reminded me of-- you know-of what's in the car. in the trunk.

speaker1: it feels really... good. ..here. 
speaker2: i know. it's the house you want to wake up in on christmas morning. make yourself at home. i'll be right back.

speaker1: cups a hand over his ear. 
speaker1: sara? hi. it's grady.
speaker2: where are you, grady? an elevator?
speaker1: i'm in kinship. listen, sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
speaker2: you're in kinship?
speaker1: yes. but that's not why i called...
speaker2: with emily?
speaker1: what? no'. there's no one here. i'm just ...just....
speaker2: just what? doing a little dusting?
speaker3: good morning! good morning!
speaker1: james! for christ sake, will you turn that thing down!
speaker2: james? he's still with you?

speaker1: are you there to not reconcile with her? 
speaker2: no. sara, you don't understand...
speaker1: trust me, i understand. i just want to say something to you, grady.
speaker2: yea?
speaker1: how you choose to live your own life is your business. but you be careful with that boy, grady. with james. he belongs to somebody else.

speaker1: hullo. 
speaker2: mom. dad.

speaker1: well, it's infected, i can tell you that. i'm just going to clean it up a bit. it's up to you to-find someone who knows what they're doing. here. put your foot up. 
speaker1: so he's one of your students, this boy?
speaker2: yes. he's a good kid. maybe a little messed up.
speaker1: well, i'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine. grady tries to read hank's face---is he messing with
speaker2: what made you pull out that old thing?
speaker1: i was thinking of you.
speaker2: and?
speaker1: it's no arsonist's daughter, but i guess you know that. it's a young man's book. it got me remembering how it felt to be young.
speaker2: maybe i should read it.
speaker1: oh, i don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, grady. grady doesn't have to read hank's face this time.
speaker2: where's emily, hank?
speaker1: i 'don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, grady.
speaker2: i'm not going to stalk her. hank. i just. ..want to know where i stand. hank looks up, incredulous.
speaker1: where you stand?
speaker2: l-just want to say i'm sorry.
speaker1: she's in philadelphia seeing linda aahby. the neurologist.
speaker2: neurologist? why? what's wrong?
speaker1: nothing's wrong. they went to wellesley together.
speaker1: ah, right. the book.
speaker2: listen, hank, i'm sorry about ail this. i
speaker1: why did you come here, grady?
speaker2: i -just wanted to see her, i guess-- emily. and to see you too-you and irene. and to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this-everything that's happening-it's not forever. it doesn't mean "goodbye."
speaker1: give me a break, grady. hank snaps off the tape, slaps grady's ankle.
speaker1: you're done.

speaker1: i'm having a really good time, professor tripp. 
speaker2: i'm really happy for you, james. but do me a favor, will you? lay off my dope. that stuff's not for amateurs.

speaker1: i just wanted a little sip. 
speaker1: probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
speaker2: jesus... look, james, you appear to possess-like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way-a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. however, i 'think it's best if, for the moment at least ...we abstain.
speaker1: you're mad at me, aren't you?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: you're mad because i shot your girlfriend's dog.
speaker2: it wasn't her dog. it's her husband's-- who said anything about girlfriend?
speaker2: okay, james, i wish you hadn't shot my
speaker1: sure you do. you were thinking: 'that's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' you were thinking 'i can't let that kid get on. the bus alone-he might never get on the bus again.' you were thinking: 'i've got to find a way to distract this kid. ' so you did. it was--in its way--a noble act.
speaker2: thanks for the halo, james, but i've . never done that much thinking ahead in my" life-ever. james looks -out the window, pondering this.
speaker1: so, why did you take me up there?
speaker1: it's warm.
speaker2: james, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat. james just blinks, no ready answer-available.
speaker2: that's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
speaker1: because of my coat?
speaker2: because you act like a spook all the time. not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
speaker1: jealous? of me?
speaker2: not you. your talent.
speaker1: you're lying.
speaker2: the i am.
speaker1: yes you are. my stuff stinks. i know it. you said so yourself.
speaker2: i never said that.
speaker1: yes you did. last night. to your friend
speaker2: i didn't mean it that way.
speaker1: it's okay, professor tripp. carrie, howard, the others--they 're right. my stories are annoying. they go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and--
speaker2: shut up, james. you're annoying. carrie and howard don't know what the they're talking about, okay? the entire class combined- including the lovely hannah green-has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
speaker1: but, last night...
speaker2: who cares what-. i said last night, james i i was drunk, i was stoned. i'd been bitten by a dog. my wife had left me. how 'bout cutting me some slack?
speaker1: i'm sorry.
speaker2: and don't be so sensitive. who cares what anybody thinks anyway? you want to .be a good writer? you want to be-a great writer? then stop giving a what other people think. most of them haven't thought in .years.
speaker2: let me spell it .out for you, james. books don't mean anything. not to anybody. not anymore.
speaker1: arsonist's daughter meant something.
speaker1: i mean it. it means something to me. it's one of the reasons i came to school here. to be in your class. to be taught by you. it's one of the reasons i wanted to become a writer.
speaker2: well, for that, if nothing else, james, i'm sorry.

speaker1: you coming? 
speaker2: in a minute. get us a table.

speaker1: c-a-r-v-e-i. that's right, carvel. yes, i'm sure. it's outside scranton. 
speaker1: you have no listing. okay, well, lady-- at

speaker1: want a bite? 
speaker2: no thanks.
speaker1: that's why you're having them. your spells.
speaker2: spells? james, you make it sound like we're in a tennessee williams play. i don't have spells.
speaker1: what would you call them then?
speaker2: i don't know. ...'episodes.' james shrugs, spears a fluffy chunk of pie.
speaker1: it's because you don't eat.
speaker2: i eat.
speaker1: when?
speaker2: when nobody's looking.
speaker2: you just worry about yourself, james. okay?
speaker1: okay.
speaker2: nowhere. you just sit here and... eat.

speaker1: professor tripp? 
speaker2: grady.
speaker1: fred leer. this is my wife amanda.
speaker2: looks like i've dashed a-wonderful evening.
speaker3: hardly.
speaker4: we were on our way to a benefit. but, as luck would have it, the club was on the way, so... we were able to put in an appearance.
speaker3: otherwise we would've been here earlier.
speaker2: ah. well, that's ail right. james and i 'had a little dinner.
speaker3: well, certainly we'll reimburse you.
speaker2: that's not necessary. i just felt. ..it might be good for james to be with his family this weekend.
speaker3: well, of course, we can understand that.
speaker2: well. let me go get him.
speaker4: excuse me?

speaker1: i'm not going with them.. 
speaker2: james. listen. things-things are a little
speaker1: i'm not going, with them.
speaker2: james, like it or not, they're your parents.
speaker1: parents? they're not my parents. they're my grandparents. my parents are dead. grady stares at-james wearily.
speaker1: i swear. my father had his own airplane he
speaker1: i 'swear. my father was a senior vice
speaker2: i remember that. five or six years ago.
speaker1: six. their plane went down right outside scranton.
speaker2: near carvel?
speaker1: i'm sorry about all that. i just-i don't like to talk about my family. they treat me like a freak.
speaker2: james, come on. that man is obviously your father. you look just like him.
speaker1: there's a reason for that.
speaker2: get out of here.
speaker1: that's why she hates me. that's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
speaker2: in the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of amontillado. come on. up.
speaker1: i swear.

speaker1: thank you. professor tripp. 
speaker2: take care of him.
speaker3: oh, don't worry. we'll take care of him. you can be sure of that.
speaker2: hey!

speaker1: hey. 
speaker2: grady!
speaker1: no, it's okay. i just can't believe i left it out in the open like that. crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? poking around?
speaker2: i don't know--maybe- i don't think so.
speaker1: listen, hannah. you don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? james' aunt.
speaker2: he shot the chancellor's dog, didn't he? the blind one.
speaker1: actually, he's not the chancellor' s--what?
speaker2: at first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon dr. gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet -
speaker1: 
speaker2: crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in.
speaker1: crabtree? he doesn't even know james.
speaker2: who does?
speaker3: trip?! where are you' grady looks anxiously toward the door.
speaker1: the aunt, hannah. where did you take james that day?
speaker2: i told you, sewickly heights.
speaker1: but where? i need the street.
speaker2: i don't know, grady. i just dropped him on a corner.
speaker3: trip?!
speaker1: 
speaker2: no! don't go. i've been waiting ail night for you.
speaker1: listen, hannah, i'm flattered, really, but right now i--
speaker1: you stay there.
speaker3: what? ohhhh. is that... it?
speaker3: honestly, tripp. do you actually think i would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
speaker1: gee, i don't know. crabs. i don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
speaker3: sometimes we have to improvise.
speaker3: james? my james? what's happened?
speaker1: nothing, he's just been sort of, i don't know.. .kidnapped.
speaker3: kidnapped? by who?
speaker1: his parents.
speaker3: good let's go rescue him.
speaker1: good idea. crabs. only one problem. i don't know where they live.
speaker3: ah. wait a minute. the university must know where he lives.
speaker1: it's a little late to call admissions.
speaker3: is it a little late to call the chancellor?
speaker1: maybe ...i don't know.
speaker2: two-sixty-two baxter drive.
speaker3: you know--based on what i've read-- this is a very exciting piece of material, this big parade.
speaker1: love. it's love facade--and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? you skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
speaker3: i've been doing this a long time, tripp. i feel this kid in my bones.
speaker1: only in your bones?
speaker3: no. i think i might be right. i've felt it before...
speaker1: how bad is it for you?
speaker3: bad enough. and knows i don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
speaker1: which is?
speaker3: competence.
speaker1: what's to tell?
speaker3: plenty, i'm sure. but, for what it's worth...
speaker3: ...i like her.
speaker1: me too.

speaker1: there must be two dozen windows on . that thing. how are we-supposed to find his? 
speaker2: i told you. they keep him chained in the basement. come on.

speaker1: doris day. 
speaker2: james leer.

speaker1: hey. what are you guys doing here? 
speaker2: we're springing you. leer. get some pants on.
speaker3: i can't believe you made fun of my robe.

speaker1: i like what you've done with it. when's captain nemo moving in? 
speaker2: the candelabras were my gran's.
speaker3: oh, christ, don't start on ol' gran or we'll leave you here.
speaker1: hey, i heard all about it--the parents, the grandparents, the china town thing-- and i believe you, okay? that's why we're here. now go get dressed.
speaker2: can i--i mean--do you mind--if i wear this again. professor tripp?
speaker3: ah, wear whatever you want.
speaker1: so modest.
speaker3: so sensitive.
speaker1: oh, come on, tripp. cut the kid some slack.
speaker3: it's just ail that he spins out. just once i'd like to know if the little is telling the truth.
speaker1: the-truth. i know that's always been real important to you. key, check this out...
speaker1: finally, the door opened. it-was a shock to: see him, shuffling into the room like an aging prizefighter. limping. beaten.' sound like anyone we know? but it was later, when the great man squinted into the bitter glow or twilight... bitter glow of twilight? this kid definitely needs an editor. ...and muttered simply, "it means nothing. all of it.
speaker3: yes? 'his heart...' crabtree hesitates, then... reads on:
speaker1: 'his heart, once capable of inspiring others so completely, could no longer inspire so much as itself. it beat now only out of habit. it beat now only because it could. ' grady nods, his face unreadable, then james returns.
speaker2: i'm ready... james stops, sees the two men looking at him.
speaker2: you all right, professor tripp?
speaker1: he's great. come on, let's blow before ol' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
speaker2: oh, well, that's just it. she's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. if i'm not here, she might ...call the police or.. .something.
speaker1: hhhuh. so we decoy her. stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
speaker3: no.
speaker3: i've got something better than a teddy bear.

speaker1: crabtree. 
speaker2: ye-es?
speaker1: nothing.

speaker1: hey. 
speaker2: how are you--is it joe?
speaker3: jeff. sorry. i didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
speaker2: don't sweat it. well. 'night, jeff.
speaker3: oh, professor tripp? you know, last semester, what i said that time in office hours-i hope there's no hard feelings.
speaker2: no...
speaker3: i mean, i was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail up and-- well--i was pretty bent in general.
speaker2: it's cool, jeff. really.
speaker3: i just want you to know that's why i dropped your class and said all that about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo-faulknerian nobody.

speaker1: hello? hello...? 
speaker2: walter?
speaker3: yes?
speaker2: it's grady, walter.
speaker3: grady?
speaker2: grady tripp. english department.
speaker3: i know it's you, grady, i just... christ, grady, do you know what time it -is?
speaker3: it's three-thirty, grady.
speaker2: this is important.
speaker3: oh?

speaker1: what is it, grady? 
speaker2: i'm in love with your wife.
speaker1: excuse me?
speaker2: sara. i'm in love with her. silence. then walter's voice returns: even, administrative.
speaker1: are you drinking. professor tripp? right now.
speaker2: no.
speaker1: nevertheless, i'd like to see you in my office monday morning. as the line goes dead, grady stares at the phone,

speaker1: sara. 
speaker2: i tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong... sara leans down, replaces the uncradled phone. sara ...with your phone. unfortunately, mine was ringing loud and clear this morning.
speaker1: oh?
speaker2: it seems one of our students is - missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
speaker2: i'm not very happy with you right now, grady. but more importantly, walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. they seem to think james leer is somehow responsible for all of this. you wouldn't happen to know where james is, would you, grady?
speaker1: inside.
speaker2: and the jacket?
speaker1: over there. in the backseat of the...
speaker2: grady.
speaker1: honestly. someone stole my car. i parked it right there last night.
speaker2: are you sure you parked it there?
speaker1: of course, i'm sure. ah, christ, the puberty police are back.
speaker2: i'll deal with this. you dig up james.

speaker1: is he awake? 
speaker2: i'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
speaker1: nevertheless. there's a police officer
speaker3: that same guy?
speaker3: you snore.
speaker2: so i hear.
speaker3: no offense, professor tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
speaker2: he's right, you look horrible.
speaker1: thank you, frankie and annette.
speaker3: it's the chancellor.
speaker2: ah, right. well, i gave you my opinion.
speaker1: and we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
speaker3: i'm fine, right. fit as a fiddle.
speaker1: shut up, james.
speaker2: so what's the problem?
speaker4: how's it coming back there, professor tripp?
speaker2: who's that?
speaker1: who do you think it is?
speaker2: the chancellor's here? now?
speaker1: evidently. coming!
speaker3: does she mean--does she know about ...her dog?
speaker1: it's walter's dog and yes, she does. know. but let's spare her the details. come on, your shoes are in the hail.
speaker2: james. this book of yours. it's not bad. not bad at all.
speaker3: thank you.
speaker2: you're welcome.
speaker2: i want to publish this. i've got to. i think they'll let me. with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
speaker1: great. between you and officer pupcik out

speaker1: don't worry, james, i'll figure something out. 
speaker2: i'm not worried. you're not worried, are you. professor tripp?
speaker1: i'm a little worried, james.
speaker2: don't be. i don't care if they expel me. i probably should be expelled.
speaker1: well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
speaker2: professor tripp...?
speaker1: yes, james.
speaker2: even if i end up going to jail.... james smiles his crooked grin. james leer you're still the best teacher i ever had.
speaker3: this is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, grady.
speaker1: would walter really press charges?
speaker3: it's within the realm. he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
speaker1: i think i might have.
speaker3: and what do you think you might have said?
speaker1: i think i might've said i was in love with you. sara's face remains .unchanged. grady he told you.
speaker3: he told me.
speaker1: and what did you say?
speaker3: i said it didn't sound like you.
speaker4: so- what do we do now? ,
speaker1: find the jacket.
speaker4: oh' huh. exactly how do we do that?
speaker1: first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car.
speaker4: it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.

speaker1: i'm telling you, the tango is ail about latent homosexual love. look at the way they dance-- it's sodomy. 
speaker2: stop it.
speaker2: grady. hi. what's up?
speaker1: i'll be ...somewhere else.
speaker3: hey, jeff. if you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall. jeff nods--puzzled--then goes. grady smirks.
speaker3: he cribbed that from borges.
speaker2: it beats 'what's your major?'
speaker3: right. anyway, i was wondering if i could borrow your car. mine's sort of out of commission.
speaker2: sure. the keys are on the dresser next to. ..to your book.
speaker2: i uh, i didn't finish, i ...fell asleep.
speaker3: that good, hub?
speaker2: no, it's not that, it's...
speaker2: it's just that, you know, i was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us '-that writers make choices--at least the good ones. and, don't get me wrong. i'm not saying the book isn't really great-i mean, really great- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and ail the dental records and so on-and i don't know, maybe i'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... ...you didn't make any choices at all. and i was

speaker1: want some help with that? 
speaker2: don't touch it.

speaker1: let me get this straight. jerry nathan owes you money. so, as collateral, he gives you his car. 
speaker2: only now i'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly jerry's to give.
speaker1: so whose car is it?
speaker2: my guess-vernon hardapple.
speaker1: the hood jumper?
speaker2: he said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
speaker1: such as.
speaker2: 'that's my car, motherfucker.'
speaker1: hh hub. so. we find vernon, we find the car. we find the car...
speaker2: ...we find the jacket.
speaker1: there's only one problem, tripp. we don't know his real name. we just made it up. in fact, we made the whole guy up.
speaker2: no wonder he screwed us over.

speaker1: christ, tripp. how did you know? 
speaker2: call it a hunch.
speaker1: i'd call it genius.
speaker2: it's good to know i'm still talented at something. keep the motor running.

speaker1: i know you. . . 
speaker2: oola.
speaker3: i never forget a drink.
speaker2: i never forget an oola.
speaker4: forget me?
speaker2: vernon.
speaker5: move away, cupcake. he's got a gun.
speaker2: who's got a gun?
speaker5: you've got a gun, motherfucker. drop it!
speaker2: relax, vernon...
speaker3: why's he calling you vernon?
speaker5: why's he sitting in my car? he's crazy, that's why. he probably calls everybody vernon.
speaker2: not true. you're the only vernon i know. actually, i'm wrong. i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin u.k.
speaker5: shut up. cupcake. please. inside.
speaker3: you' re not going to shoot him, are you?
speaker5: i'm going to shoot him. if he doesn't put that gun down.
speaker2: it's just a souvenir. they don't even make the caps anymore.
speaker5: i know a gun when i see one. and that's a gun.
speaker2: no, really....

speaker1: holy 
speaker2: vernon stands half-hunched, stunned.
speaker3: are you crazy!
speaker3: you all right, cupcake?
speaker4: who's vernon?
speaker3: what the...?
speaker1: tripp! run!
speaker3: who the is that?
speaker5: a manhattan book editor murdering a mormon girl's clutch.
speaker3: woah.
speaker5: no! don't shoot! he's just a lousy driver.
speaker5: oh... my...

speaker1: naturally you have copies. 
speaker2: i have an alternate version of the first chapter.
speaker1: you'll be all right then. look at carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
speaker2: that was maccaulay.
speaker1: or hemingway, when hadley lost all those stories.
speaker2: he was never able to reproduce them.
speaker1: bad examples. look, tripp, i don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps--in a sense- this-- is for the best. grady's eyes shift, study crabtree.
speaker2: kind of a sign, you're saying.
speaker1: in a sense.
speaker2: i don't think so. in my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
speaker3: let me get this straight. all that paper that went into the river. that was the only copy?
speaker2: 'fraid so.
speaker1: i'm just saying that sometimes,
speaker3: i'll tell you the problem. you behind the wheel. there's your problem.
speaker1: that's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
speaker3: hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
speaker1: excuse me. did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
speaker3: he was trying to steal my car!
speaker2: ail right, all right it's done. there's no need to talk about it. it's done.
speaker4: so what was it about? your book. what was the story?
speaker2: i don't know...
speaker1: what he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. it-lives in the mind.
speaker3: yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? i mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
speaker2: i couldn't stop.

speaker1: hey, vernon. can i ask you a question? 
speaker2: shoot.
speaker1: boy or girl?
speaker2: as long as it looks like her, i don't care. you know what i'm saying?
speaker1: right. well, thanks. for the lift.
speaker2: no sweat. only do me a favor?
speaker1: sure.
speaker2: stop calling me vernon.
speaker3: the jacket, tripp. we need the jacket. grady oh, right. oola. about that jacket...
speaker4: yea?
speaker1: it used to belong to marilyn monroe. she had small shoulders, like you. most people don't know that. as oola smiles, pleased, vernon shakes his head.
speaker2: man, that book of yours must've been one nutty ride.
speaker3: you mind explaining what you just did?
speaker1: came to my senses. crabtree
speaker1: walter gaskell isn't going to send james leer to jail, crabs. i know that.
speaker3: do you know he won't expel him?
speaker1: no. but i don't think that matters.
speaker3: that's very enlightened, professor. it's
speaker1: nobody teaches a writer anything. you tell
speaker3: me? what can i do?
speaker1: gee, i don't know, crabs... improvise. you're good at that.
speaker3: i'm sorry, tripp.
speaker1: you peeked, didn't you?
speaker3: i peeked.
speaker3: it really had the makings, tripp. there was a lot to admire. i've ...never read anything quite like it.
speaker1: you're not just trying to make me feel better? crabtree looks directly at grady, his old friend.
speaker3: scout's honor.
speaker1: well, thanks for that, crabs.

speaker1: sara! 
speaker2: grady. i have to tell you. i took another look at arsonist's daughter the other night. there's a description of a bald cypress that left' me breathless.

speaker1: hey, professor tripp. 
speaker2: if you're looking for hannah, she's on the aisle.
speaker3: no...
speaker2: who's that guy she's with? didn't he used to be in workshop?
speaker3: jeff. he comes from a long line of tango dancers.

speaker1: and now, as those of you who've been with us in previous years know, we have a tradition of sorts here at wordfest. i'm speaking, of course, of the plums. an anticipatory buzz sweeps through the audience as walter begins to read from a separate list. 
speaker1: this weekend, susan lowery, of north braddock, found a publisher for her children's book. the loneliest prawn, susan, stand up.

speaker1: and robert wilkenson--who many of you know for his city beat column in the post-gazette--has found a home with putnam for his new three rivers thriller. blood patterns. robert. 
speaker1: now, this next one, i think, is especially exciting to announce, because it concerns a student here at the university. our own james leer, a sophomore in english literature, has found a publisher for his first novel, which i believe is called the lovely parade. grady blinks, leans forward, and watches walter smile
speaker2: i have a class with him.
speaker2: the guy's kind of an alien probe, if you know what i mean.
speaker3: take a bow, james!
speaker1: and finally--and perhaps not least

speaker1: until next year. thank you, everyone. 
speaker2: sara!

speaker1: yo, traxler. 
speaker2: hey, professor tripp.
speaker1: do you get high, sam?
speaker2: only when i'm working.
speaker2: holy are you serious?
speaker1: as a heart attack.
speaker2: thanks-whoa, professor tripp, careful ^here...
speaker3: grady, what are you doing, you idiot?
speaker1: looking for you.

speaker1: i passed out. 
speaker2: you did.
speaker1: i've been doing that a lot lately.
speaker2: so i hear. you've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, i understand.
speaker1: do you think that's why i've been having these... ... spells?
speaker2: how long have you been having them?
speaker1: the last month maybe.
speaker2: how long have you been smoking marijuana?
speaker1: spiro t. agnew was vice president, i believe.
speaker2: that's probably not the problem, then. what about your lifestyle. any major changes recently?
speaker1: i've been trying to finish a book...
speaker2: and your wife left you.
speaker1: is that in my chart?
speaker2: i spoke with the woman who saved your life. you're lucky she came along when she did. grady considers the larger ramifications of this statement
speaker1: i know.
speaker2: you need to see a doctor, mr. tripp. an internist. and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
speaker1: she told you about. . .
speaker2: her dog, yes.
speaker1: actually, it was her husband's dog...
speaker2: look, mr. tripp. you have a drug problem, all right? on top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. we pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. as for your spells. i'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
speaker1: they're anxiety attacks? that's a little disappointing.
speaker2: better luck next time.
speaker1: so is my friend...is sara still here?
speaker2: no. there's no one here.
speaker1: i have to see her. as soon as possible.
speaker2: look, mr. tripp. if you really want to leave, i can't stop you. but i'm going to write you a prescription for a course of ampicillin and i want you to follow it to the end-no matter how stupid you decide to be with everything else. all right?

speaker1: is that a suggestion? 
speaker1: i'm so glad to see you, sara.
speaker2: i believe you. did that nice doctor let you out? or-is this you improvising again, grady?
speaker1: i'm through improvising.
speaker2: terry told me about wonder boys. is it true? did you lose it all?
speaker1: i lost it ail.
speaker2: oh, grady. you're such a putz.
speaker1: i know.
speaker2: and you're old.
speaker1: ouch. how many?
speaker2: dozens. it's very sad.
speaker1: i went and looked at-some babies just now.
speaker2: oh?
speaker1: i guess you have to go on faith.
speaker2: some times...
speaker1: did you tell walter?
speaker2: i told walter.
speaker1: does he still love you?
speaker2: it didn't come up.
speaker1: well i do. i've always loved you, sara. i
speaker2: did you just make that up?
speaker2: don't write a page when a paragraph will do.
speaker1: you don't deserve me, you know.
speaker2: i know, but sometimes...
