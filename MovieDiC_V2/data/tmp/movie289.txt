BLONDE GIRL: daniel, what's wrong? did you break your ankle? 
BLONDE GIRL: oh my

HENRI: taillights in five minutes. what we can't carry -- 
DANIEL: -- we burn. i know the drill.

HENRI: florida's clear. i sent a letter to the school and there's nothing in the papers. 
DANIEL: i didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.

HENRI: new ids. 
DANIEL: just when i think you can't get any less original, you lower the bar.
HENRI: i'm not interested in originality. i'm interested in untraceable. there are 335,321 john smiths in the united states.

JOHN: it's been so long since the last scar. 
HENRI: you got lulled into a false sense of security. that's my fault.
JOHN: i liked florida. i liked having friends. i liked feeling normal.
HENRI: i wish that you could have a normal life -- but you can't.
JOHN: then why fake it? why not just go hole up in the wilderness.
HENRI: that's exactly what number 3 did.

HENRI: it's from an african news site. a man and his son went missing two nights ago. the locals think they were taken by strange beasts. 
JOHN: piken.
HENRI: the mogadorians are natural-born hunters. blending in is our best protection.
JOHN: so we just keep moving from town to town?
HENRI: until i say otherwise -- yes.
JOHN: i want to be from someplace, henri.
HENRI: you are.
JOHN: lorien's your home, i don't even remember it.
HENRI: like it or not, it's your home too. you have a responsibility to those who died.
JOHN: i want a say in where we live. you already picked it, didn't you?
9.: henri revs the engine to life.
HENRI: cheer up, you're going to be living in paradise.

JOHN: she looks even perkier than the realtor in florida. 
HENRI: what's your name?
JOHN: john smith.
HENRI: where are you from, john?
JOHN: arizona.
HENRI: why did you move to paradise?
JOHN: because you're an

JOHN: because my dad needs peace and quiet to research his book. 
HENRI: this was a lot easier when you were

ANNIE: here we are. home sweet home. 
ANNIE: first impressions?
HENRI: it's perfect.
JOHN: that's one word for it.
ANNIE: i feel your pain. i have a daughter his age. apparently, i ruin her life on a daily basis.
JOHN: this guy was covering a hole in my wall.
ANNIE: i told the handyman to patch that before you arrived. i'm so sorry.

HENRI: don't you worry about it. 
ANNIE: we'll knock it off the rent. keep the poster, bernie kosar brings good luck here in the buckeye state.

JOHN: that's the last of them. i'm hitting the sack. 
HENRI: i need a new photo first.
HENRI: say paradise.
HENRI: i've imputed the new search words: daniel jones. big pine key. sunset high school. you think of any others?
JOHN: yeah, this place
12.: henri swivels to face him.
HENRI: if there's a story or picture of you on the internet, this program will find it. our enemy doesn't know who you are -- i want to keep it that way.
JOHN: sand dollar beach, that's where we were jet skiing.

JOHN: he's starving, doesn't have any collar or tags. 
HENRI: must have been dumped.

JOHN: you know, another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldn't be a bad thing. 
HENRI: what are you going to call him?
JOHN: since i need all the luck i can get -- how about bernie kosar?

JOHN: wow. you outdid yourself. what's up? 
JOHN: i already have a backpack.
HENRI: this one has five days of rations, spare clothes, cash and a handheld gps. keep it with you at all times.
JOHN: henri, come on.
HENRI: game's changed. you're in the crosshairs now. you have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. with or without me.

JOHN: bernie, what the hell... were you hiding in the car? 
FEMALE VOICE: hey, i was about to take a picture of the little guy.

JOHN: he's not supposed to be here. 
JOHN: go home. now.
SARAH: he's really well-trained. how long have you had him?
JOHN: sorry about your shot.
SARAH: no worries.
SARAH: you just moved into the house on old mill road. it's john, right?
15.: john swings back, concerned.
SARAH: don't worry, i'm not stalking you. my mom said she rented it to a guy with a son my age. since i know every other face on this quad, that had to be you.
SARAH: i'm sarah.
SARAH: where are you from?
JOHN: someplace warmer.
SARAH: i don't think that qualifies as an actual answer.
JOHN: i need to register. she raises her camera to snap a shot of him.
JOHN: whoa. what are you doing?
SARAH: capturing your first day, even though you're technically six weeks late.
JOHN: please don't point that at me.
SARAH: afraid the camera's going to steal your soul?
JOHN: what's your problem? i said no.
SARAH: it's only for the yearbook.

VOICE: welcome to paradise, irony not included. 
SAM: his name's mark jayne. quarterback, sheriff's son, he's three years into the best four years of his life.
SAM: do yourself a favor -- stay off his radar.
JOHN: didn't know i was on it.
SAM: you were talking to sarah harte.
JOHN: she was talking to me.
SAM: mark and sarah have been exclusive since freshmen year.

SAM: if there's another guy in her airspace, he shoots them down. you got a warning shot. 
JOHN: maybe i'll fire back next time.
SAM: look, you're new, so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater. football players are gods -- the rest of us are mere mortals. if you want to survive, keep your head down and don't make waves.
JOHN: you sound like my dad.
SAM: obviously a wise man.
SAM: i'm sam by the way.
JOHN: thanks for the download.

COACH: enough! hit the showers. 
COACH: lebron, grab a broom.

BERNIE KOSAR.: the dog is studying him with his head cocked. 
HENRI: let's keep this our little secret.

SAM: first day here and you're already destroying school property. so much for not making waves. 
JOHN: it was an accident.
SAM: i hear the real spectator sport was mark and sarah's blowout.
SAM: dude, you okay?
JOHN: fine.
MARK: you got a problem?
JOHN: line starts back there.
MARK: football players get priority.

JOHN: where's that posted? 
MARK: unwritten rule.
MARK: i'm surprised your boyfriend didn't tell you.
MARK: if you don't know your place around here, things can get rough.
JOHN: in that case, i guess i better ask you where i should sit. i was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your girlfriend.
MARK: you want to talk trash? let's see you back it up.

SAM: dude, hold up! 
SAM: you look like crap. i'll get the nurse.

HENRI: calm down. you're going to be okay. 
JOHN: on what planet is this okay?
HENRI: yours.
HENRI: i need to get you out of here.

JOHN: okay, start talking. what the hell's going on? 
HENRI: your first legacy is starting to manifest.
JOHN: legacy?
HENRI: an extraordinary ability. yours is called lumen. they start a lot sooner on lorien. i was beginning to fear yours would never emerge.
JOHN: you knew this was going to happen?
HENRI: i didn't want to worry you. you were already under enough pressure.
HENRI: i'm sorry.

JOHN: whoa. 
HENRI: open it.
JOHN: what are they?
HENRI: crystals from lorien's core. they'll guide us in your training.

HENRI: our solar system. 
HENRI: that's what lorien looked like thousands of years ago. we had all the problems that earth has today. the planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly lorien began to heal itself -- that's when the legacies started.
HENRI: only a select few developed these abilities. they became known as the garde.
JOHN: that's what i am?
HENRI: like your parents and grandparents.
JOHN: the other children in the ship...
HENRI: they're garde as well. once you've mastered your legacies, we'll find them and face the mogadorians together.

JOHN: what legacy do you have? 
HENRI: i don't have any and never will. i'm your cepan -- a teacher. my job is not just to protect you but to train you.
HENRI: give me your hand.
HENRI: trust me.
HENRI: you feel that?
JOHN: ouch.
HENRI: when we're done, your entire body will be shielded against fire.
HENRI: you'll get other legacies too.
JOHN: flying would be cool.
HENRI: you don't get to pick them off a menu.
HENRI: mogs don't knock.

HENRI: it's a girl. 
SARAH: how'd you do it?
JOHN: do what?
SARAH: eviscerate the entire senior class?
SARAH: i was in the darkroom before lunch and they were hanging on the line smiling and looking forward to the future. when i got back, i found 15 rolls of negatives wiped clean.
JOHN: i don't know what you're talking about.
SARAH: so you weren't in the darkroom today?
JOHN: no.
SARAH: here's a tip. if you're going to lie, don't leave a big red backpack at the scene of the crime.

JOHN: i don't know what happened. maybe it's a sign that you should invest in a digital camera. 
SARAH: digital film tells the truth. clearly, i'm not going to get that from you.

HENRI: everything okay? 
JOHN: she was returning my backpack.
HENRI: i think you should stay home from school for a couple of days.
JOHN: i'm fine.
HENRI: just to be safe.

JOHN: i'm going for a run. 
JOHN: sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up.

SARAH: i think you have the wrong room. 
JOHN: wanted to apologize.
SARAH: does the apology come with an explanation?
SARAH: wait.
SARAH: how about we delete monday and start over?
SARAH: i'm sarah.
JOHN: john.
SARAH: nice gloves.

JOHN: you know all these people? 
SARAH: curse of a small town. i've been around them my whole life. kim thomas. she peed in her bed at a sleepover when we were seven.
SARAH: neil bailey. president of the debate club. plays five instruments. doesn't know he's gay yet.
SARAH: mrs. ross. ap english. she's been here so long, she taught my mom and my four brothers. i'm the baby of the family in case you were wondering.
SARAH: so what's your story?
JOHN: not very interesting.
SARAH: determined to keep the mystery alive, aren't you?
JOHN: you first.
SARAH: okay. recovering cheerleader. wannabe vegetarian but i still love burgers. dreams of being a photojournalist.
SARAH: i've never actually admitted that last one to anybody before.

JOHN: your secret's safe with me. 
SARAH: you ever feel you don't belong in your own life?
JOHN: every single day.
SARAH: wow. that almost sounded like a straight answer.
MARK: what's he doing in here?
SARAH: i thought you were on two-a-days.
MARK: coach wants me to rest my arm before the scouts come. you didn't answer my question?
SARAH: john was helping me move some boards.
JOHN: i'm going to take off.
MARK: seriously, sarah, what's up with this guy?
SARAH: i don't have time for this, mark.
MARK: but you had time to go to his house the other night.

SARAH: you were following me? 
MARK: just trying to figure out what's going on with you.
SARAH: you've crossed so many lines i can't even speak to you right now.
MARK: this isn't over.

SAM: nice freakout the other day. 
JOHN: wasn't feeling well.

MARK: told you it wasn't over. 
SAM: assholes.

JOHN: that sensation you're feeling -- remember it. 
JOHN: show's over.

SAM: i raided lost and found. 
SAM: i know. nobody loses anything cool.
SAM: dude, the way you thrashed mark back there. awesome move.
JOHN: who's in the picture?
SAM: my dad. my real dad. i took it the summer before he split.

SAM: he dragged me and my mom all over the yucatan. he was looking for evidence of ancient astronauts. 
JOHN: sounds like a fun vacation.
SAM: i know. insane. he called himself an anthropologist even though he only made it through one semester of college.
SAM: always thought he'd come back one day -- who was i kidding. the guy's a joke.

SARAH: john. 
SARAH: i heard about the lockers. i'm sorry.
JOHN: i'll live.
SARAH: i broke up with mark.
SARAH: i've been thinking about doing it for a while... today just finally pushed me over the edge.
37.: he studies her face.
JOHN: why are you telling me?
SARAH: i don't know.
JOHN: you made the right call.
SARAH: halloween block party's tonight.
JOHN: i saw the banners.
SARAH: i'll be on main street hiding behind my camera if you want to swing by.
SARAH: i wasn't expecting an actual response. i could text you later. do they have cell phones on planet john?
HENRI: wasn't that your friend from the other night?
JOHN: her name's sarah.
JOHN: i didn't ask for a ride home.
HENRI: principal called. said there was an incident.
38.: john stares out the window, guilty.
JOHN: a guy was messing with me. i took care of it. problem solved.
HENRI: you're stronger and faster because of earth's gravity -- you shouldn't use that advantage to settle petty scores.
JOHN: it was no big deal. don't blow it out of proportion.
HENRI: you can't risk everything over wounded pride.
JOHN: i wasn't looking for a fight. it just happened. get off my back.
HENRI: article says it was arson.
JOHN: we were clean. there's no way the mogs can track us here.
HENRI: they can track us anywhere. i think it's time you saw what you're really up against.

GRANDFATHER: this is your cepan. go with him. 
YOUNG JOHN: no!
HENRI: your life is my life now. i will always protect you.
GRANDFATHER: he must survive.

JOHN: i saw my grandfather. i saw what you did to the mogadorians -- you saved my life. 
HENRI: a lot of lorics sacrificed their lives so that you could live.
42.: john is still trying to process the memory.
JOHN: he said i must survive.
HENRI: the elders had a plan. you weren't on that ship by chance. the nine of you were chosen for a reason. even if only two of you live, together you'll pose a grave threat to our enemy.
JOHN: you saw what they did to lorien. how can nine or six or two of us take on that army? it's hopeless.
HENRI: i never thought we'd get off lorien alive -- but we did. i didn't know how we could survive on a strange planet -- but we have. i gave us six months before the mogs found us -- it's been 10 years. don't give up now.
HENRI: you have the potential to do great things. even if you don't see it -- i do.
JOHN: how can you put so much faith in me?
HENRI: because your life is my life. if you quit, then everything i've worked for and sacrificed is meaningless.
HENRI: remember -- nothing is inevitable.

JOHN: it's sarah. the block party's tonight. i'll say i can't make it. 
HENRI: no... go.
HENRI: you've had enough for one day.

JOHN: you work here? 
SAM: not by choice. ed's my stepdad. he's under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn, they'll suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods.
SAM: i put those on special tonight for any wannabe jason voorhees.

SAM: screw this. let me lock up. i'll hang with you. 
JOHN: what about your stepdad?
SAM: he hit the tavern at 6:00. he's already hammered by now. i'll probably find him passed out on the doorstep. every night is trick ã¢â€â˜r treat at my house.

SAM: she's over there. 
SARAH: you made it. like the t-shirt, sam.
SAM: guidance counsellor said i need to set goals for myself. figured i'd aim high.
SARAH: what do you think of halloween in paradise?
JOHN: they should pull out all the stops next year.
SARAH: well, you haven't had the full experience until you've been on the haunted hayride.

SARAH: give me a sec. 
SAM: i'm impressed.
SARAH: you guys ready?
SAM: three on a wagon might get a little crowded. i'll meet you two on the other side.
SARAH: sam's cool.
JOHN: definitely unique.
SARAH: i haven't really talked to him since 8th grade. mark had a tight circle. if you weren't a jock or cheerleader, you didn't exist.
JOHN: i'm glad you broke free.
SARAH: me too.

SARAH: not even a flinch. none of this scares you, does it? 
JOHN: i'm trembling on the inside.
SARAH: you can smile. i was starting to have my doubts.

GRIM REAPER: hell's gate, everybody off. 
SARAH: once we make it through, we're home free.

JOHN: what was that? 
SARAH: just part of the ride.
JOHN: are you sure?

SARAH: help! somebody! 
SAM: sarah?

JOCK: you're blinding me! stop! 
JOHN: where's sarah? tell me!!
JOCK: shepherd falls. now turn off that flashlight!

SARAH: are you crazy! where's john? 
MARK: relax. it's a practical joke.
SARAH: i swear if you hurt him --
MARK: why do you give a
SARAH: get out of my face, mark, you're pathetic.
MARK: i'm the best thing that ever happened to you and i'm giving you one more chance.
MARK: don't walk away from me!
JOHN: back off!
SARAH: john! are you okay?
MARK: where the are kevin and joe?

JOHN: they got spooked. 
MARK: hey, those are police property!
MARK: i'm going to kill you!
SARAH: john! stop!
SARAH: that's his throwing arm!
SARAH: football's all he's got.
SARAH: john! wait.
SARAH: i'm sorry, i didn't want you to break his arm.
JOHN: i'm not mad at you. i'm mad at myself.

SARAH: i had no idea mark would pull something like that. he has seriously gone off the deep end. 
JOHN: the guy's in love with you. wants you back.
SARAH: that's not love.
SARAH: walk me home?

SARAH: this is me. 
SARAH: i know. wait until the christmas decorations go up. my mom decks the halls with so many lights, you can see our house from space.
SARAH: you should see a doctor.
JOHN: for this? wouldn't waste their time.
SARAH: you're not going to tell me how you took out those football players, are you?
53.: he says nothing. she smiles.
SARAH: i really don't get you.
SARAH: but i feel like i can trust you.
JOHN: you can.
SARAH: good night.
JOHN: wait.

HENRI: i heard on the police scanner that eight boys were beaten up in the woods tonight. 
JOHN: they won't talk.
HENRI: that was a stupid thing to do.
JOHN: they attacked me. if i hadn't defended myself, i'd be in the er right now. would that have been the better choice?
JOHN: you've got to start trusting me!

JOHN: i was getting to that. i got a new legacy. 
HENRI: telekinesis. that's a big step. must have been triggered by the fight.
HENRI: i need to teach you how to control these abilities. we'll start working on that tomorrow.

JOHN: what is it? 
HENRI: we got a hit on one of the search words.
HENRI: it's a paranormal blog. ã¢â€âœthey walk among us!ã¢â€â
JOHN: that's sand dollar beach.
HENRI: looks like a cell phone camera. there's enough for the mogs to id your face.
JOHN: can you take it down?
HENRI: working on it.
JOHN: i'm sorry, henri.
HENRI: this isn't your fault. there's still nothing to trace us here.
HENRI: this could take all night. get some sleep.

SAM: i've narrowed it down to three possibilities: you're a genetic experiment, you're a freak of nature, or you're an extraterrestrial. 
JOHN: i don't know what you think happened tonight...
SAM: your hands lit up like a firefly on crack, you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies, and you took off faster than an olympic runner.

SAM: did i leave anything out? 
JOHN: what do you want from me?
SAM: i just want to know who you are.
JOHN: i'm a survivor from a planet called lorien.
SAM: your dad... he's from there too?
JOHN: henri's not my dad. he's my guardian. if he found out you knew about us, we'd be gone by morning.
JOHN: i don't want to leave paradise.
SAM: i won't tell anyone.
SAM: there's something i want to show you.

SAM: mom figured he was having an affair and took off. all these years i thought she was right. now you're here. 
JOHN: that doesn't prove anything.
SAM: it proves he wasn't crazy. i'm starting to think that he didn't bail on us... that maybe something else happened out there -- that he was taken.
SAM: guess the bar closed.
ED: sam! where are you?
ED: you think i wouldn't hear you locked up early!
JOHN: you going to be okay?
SAM: if he finds you here, it'll be worse.
SAM: go.

JOHN: you look wiped. 
HENRI: i wasn't the only who was up last night.
JOHN: sarah texted me. i went over to her house.
HENRI: i've tried every trick i know, but i can't crack that blog's firewall.
JOHN: there must be a way.
HENRI: we need to find where the site's located and take it offline manually. the url source has been run through a labyrinth of servers, it could take weeks to track down.
JOHN: i want to help.
HENRI: you can. get changed.

SARAH: i don't see any family pictures around. i guess the photo aversion is hereditary. 
SARAH: your mom... grandparents. is there anyone else in your life?
JOHN: they died.
SARAH: i'm sorry.
JOHN: it was a long time ago. it's just me and my dad now.

SARAH: i get the feeling he doesn't like me very much. 
JOHN: it takes him a while to warm up to people.
SARAH: thanksgiving's tomorrow. why don't you bring your dad and celebrate with us?
JOHN: i don't know. are there going to be a lot of people?
SARAH: a tsunami of relatives. but don't worry, i'll shield you from the wave. besides, i want everyone to meet you.
HENRI: i've found the --
JOHN: just giving bernie a quick bath.
HENRI: you're clearly putting a lot of effort into it.
SARAH: i better hit the road.
SARAH: see you tomorrow. twoish.
SARAH: bye, mr. smith.

HENRI: i finally tracked the location of that blog. it's a house in warsaw, indiana. about four hours from here. i'm heading up there tomorrow. 
JOHN: sarah invited us to thanksgiving.
HENRI: send my regrets.
JOHN: you shouldn't go alone. it could be dangerous.
HENRI: i won't risk taking you. i'll leave early and be back by five.
JOHN: don't you ever get lonely?
HENRI: how could i? i have you.
JOHN: you know what i mean. all these years, there's never been anyone.
HENRI: we aren't like humans. once we fall in love, it's for life. the pain of separation is unbearable.

HENRI: anastasia. 
JOHN: you left her to save me.
HENRI: you're not responsible for what happened to her -- they are.
HENRI: i looked at her the way you look at sarah.
HENRI: she can't come with us when we leave -- and we always have to leave, you know that.
HENRI: i was hoping to protect you from that pain.
JOHN: you can't protect me from everything.

SARAH: you look dazed. 
JOHN: just taking it all in.
SARAH: i'm glad you came.
ANNIE: don't mind me.
ANNIE: let's get a picture of you two lovebirds.
SARAH: mom. no. john really doesn't like having his --
JOHN: it's okay. let her take it.

JOHN: henri? 
JOHN: henri?

JOHN: who are you? where's henri? 
JOHN: i need your help.

SARAH: john! 
JOHN: it's henri. i have to go. sorry.
JOHN: thanks. i owe you.
SAM: anything to get out of thanksgiving at my house.
SAM: i checked out that blog on the way over. saw the video. what was the deal with your ankle?
JOHN: death scars.
SAM: they kind of look like the symbols in my dad's research.
SAM: you guys don't --
JOHN: abduct people? no.
SAM: how about the ones you said were hunting you?
JOHN: they're capable of anything.
JOHN: we need to get to warsaw -- now.

JOHN: number 417. henri tracked the url to that house. 
SAM: i don't see his suv anywhere.
JOHN: he would have parked it across town.
SAM: stole it from ed.
SAM: let's move.
JOHN: i called you because i needed a ride, not a sidekick. if i could have run here, i would have.
JOHN: go home. i'll call you when i get back.

SAM: see anything? 
JOHN: i told you to go!
SAM: they might know where my dad is!
CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER.: it's lying on the counter by the fridge.
JOHN: henri's here.
SAM: wait! other than strength, speed and night-light, what powers have you got?
JOHN: telekinesis -- but that's a work in progress.
SAM: no invisibility, x-ray vision, flight?
JOHN: sam, we drove here.
SAM: okay. i'm ready. let's do it.

SAM: hurry up. hurry up. hurry up. 
SAM: you just dead bolted it! way to go!
JOHN: new plan -- follow lucky strike. text me if he comes back.

HENRI: you shouldn't be here. 
JOHN: your life is my life, remember?
HENRI: i talked my way in. thought the big guy was buying it.

HENRI: i was asking him about the video when the other one shot me from behind... some sort of animal tranq. 
HENRI: i'm getting rusty.

JOHN: we have to leave! 
JOHN: henri!

FRANK: stay planted or i'll blow your friend's head off. 
JOHN: he came to help.

73.: sam looks over at john, impressed. 
FRANK: you're the one from the video! you're the one they're after.
JOHN: tell me what you know!
JOHN: start talking!
FRANK: i don't know what they're called. the one in the red coat said he'd kill me if i didn't do what he wanted.
HENRI: the mogadorians... they've been here?
FRANK: he told me to call if anyone came asking about the video.
JOHN: did you?
FRANK: they wanted me to hold your friend until they got here.
HENRI: we need to go! now!

JOHN: sam, get us out of here! 
SAM: i must have dropped the keys!
HENRI: start the engine.
JOHN: i can't.
HENRI: yes, you can.

FRANK: i called you like i said. it's not my fault they got away! 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER: where did they go?
76.: his accent is thick and his voice is unnerving.
FRANK: how should i know? the kid had me pinned to the ceiling.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER: where did they go?

JOHN: we'll meet you back at the house. 
HENRI: we're not going back to paradise.
HENRI: thank you for your help, but you'll never see us again.
SAM: is he serious?
SAM: what am i supposed to tell people?

JOHN: nothing. forget about us. we never existed. 
JOHN: goodbye, sam.

HENRI: we leave at nightfall. 
JOHN: henri, this is insane. they still don't know where we live.
HENRI: it's only a matter of time. they know our faces. they saw sam. how long has he known?
JOHN: since halloween.
HENRI: i trusted you and you lied to me! john bows his head, can't meet henri's gaze.
JOHN: only because i knew how you'd react and i didn't want to leave paradise.

HENRI: now we don't have a choice. the mogs are using humans to trap us. from this point on -- no more towns. no more schools. we're going off the grid until we find the others. 
JOHN: no.
HENRI: this isn't a discussion.
JOHN: i'm not leaving without saying goodbye to sarah.
HENRI: let. me. down.
HENRI: give me your phone and ids.
HENRI: john smith dies today.

UNIFORM COP: the chief wants to send the morgue boys in and seal this tomb. 
PHOTOGRAPHER: hope they haven't had lunch yet. these guys were gutted from the inside out.

PHOTOGRAPHER: who the are you? 
PHOTOGRAPHER: how'd you get in?
PHOTOGRAPHER: hey, we've got a live one down here.

SARAH: where is he, sam? 
SAM: i don't know.
SARAH: what happened last night? i've tried calling him all day. but his number's no longer in service.
SAM: forget about him, sarah.
SARAH: i'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.
SAM: he left with henri and he isn't coming back. ever.
SAM: i'm sorry.

ANNIE: little late for dessert. 
JOHN: i need to talk to sarah.
ANNIE: she's not here. some friends dragged her to a party at mark jayne's.
ANNIE: i don't usually pry into my daughter's love life, i certainly didn't want my mother in mine -- but sarah's my youngest and she's special to me.
JOHN: she's special to me too.

MARK: you weren't invited. 
JOHN: where's sarah?
MARK: she doesn't want to see you.

JOCK: everybody upstairs! kevin's going for the beer bong record! 
A CANDLE: onto the white rug.

JOHN: i'm sorry about last night. she pulls away, her relief turning to anger. 
SARAH: no. not good enough. sam said you were never coming back. what are you doing here?
JOHN: i couldn't leave without seeing you one last time.
SARAH: so it's true. what's going on? what kind of trouble are you and your dad in?
JOHN: we're going to be fine.
SARAH: damnit! whatever it is, i'll understand -- just tell me the truth.
JOHN: the truth is i'm not who you think i am. you need to forget about me.
SARAH: why are you acting like this?
JOHN: because it's the only way to keep you safe.
SARAH: safe from what? he turns away, shields her from his torment.
JOHN: goodbye, sarah.

JOHN: where's sarah? 
EMILY: went back for dozer.

SARAH: john! 
SARAH: dozer's under the bed. he's too scared to come out!
JOHN: don't let go of him. i promise i won't let go of you.
86.: as he lifts them...

JOHN: you okay? 
SARAH: you walked through that fire without getting burned. i saw you stop that beam.
JOHN: i'll explain everything... but not here... sarah... please?

JOHN: please don't look at me like that. 
SARAH: i'm sorry. i'm still trying to process everything i saw and i keep coming to the same conclusion -- what you did isn't possible.
JOHN: it is for me.
SARAH: who are you? for once please tell me the truth.
JOHN: my name isn't john. i don't have a name, just a number. 4. in fact, my whole life can be reduced to numbers: like 15 million -- that's how many light years it takes to get from my planet to earth. 38 -- that's how many towns i've lived in. or 3,671 -- that's how many days i've been running from an enemy that wants me dead. i lied to you, sarah, because i lie to everyone. that's how i stay alive.
JOHN: i shouldn't be telling you any of this. it's dangerous.

SARAH: i don't care. i just want to be with you. 
JOHN: i want that too. but if i stay you could get hurt. i have to leave to keep you safe.
SARAH: there's something i want to give you first.

MARK: where are we going? is this about the fire? it was an accident. 
89.: only now do we reverse to reveal

SARAH: what are you doing with them?
MARK: they said they were fbi. that john was a fugitive. what the hell's going on?
SIX: you've stumbled into a war. so shut up and keep your head down.
HENRI: i see age hasn't mellowed your attitude, 6.
MARK: i didn't know they were trying to kill you. i'm sorry.

JOHN: this isn't your fault -- it's mine. 
SAM: what is it, boy?
HENRI: he's telling us to run!

HENRI: bernie's a chimera. he came with us from lorien. 
JOHN: guess i wasn't the only one keeping secrets.
HENRI: somebody had to watch you when i wasn't around.

SARAH: where's john? 
HENRI: right behind us.

SIX: they've blocked it. use your telekinesis. 
JOHN: we're not leaving without my friends.
SIX: don't you mean the girl?
SIX: i broke the elders' spell to find you. the mogs can kill me now. we have to go.
JOHN: we stay and fight.

HENRI: you know how to use one of these? 
MARK: my dad's the sheriff.
JOHN: save it for the mogs. let's go!

SIX: saving your life. my new hobby.

JOHN: henri. 
JOHN: come on, taillights in five.
HENRI: i won't be coming with you this time. save yourself.
JOHN: we go together!

MOGADORIAN COMMANDER: number 4. 
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER: your cepan saved you on lorien.
MOGADORIAN COMMANDER: but this moment was inevitable.
JOHN: nothing is inevitable.

SARAH: john! 
SARAH: john!

JOHN: you good to go?
SIX: don't worry about me.
JOHN: sam, ride with six.
SIX: we don't need baggage.
SAM: i have to find out if the mogs took my dad.
SIX: you slow us down, i'll shoot you myself.
SARAH: i want to come too.
JOHN: you need to stay here.
SARAH: why?
JOHN: you could have died last night. i'm not putting you in danger again. mark's promised to look after you.
105.: tears tumble down her cheeks.
SARAH: i don't want to say goodbye.
JOHN: i'll come back for you.
SARAH: when?
JOHN: when it's safe.
JOHN: where i'm from, we only give our heart to one person. i've given mine to you.
JOHN: i love you, sarah.

JOHN: but i don't regret it. the pain reminds me what's at stake. 
JOHN: we must find the others and face our enemy together. i'm not sure how we can stop them. but nothing is inevitable. i know that now.
JOHN: i am number 4.
