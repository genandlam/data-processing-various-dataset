GANG MEMBER.: are you a doctor?
MAN.: i'm not anything anymore.
GANG MEMBER.: we got a hurt man. it'd be worth your while.

MAN.: i'm not going to let anything happen to you... i'm going to take care of you... i'm always going to try and be here for you... and i'm going to kill anybody who touches you.
MAN.: because that's my job. do you understand?
MAN.: come on, we need to get the cart back.

MAN: wait here. 
MAN: no i need you to wait. i'll hear you if you call. i'll just be a little ways and i'll be able to hear you if you get scared and you call me and i'll come right away.

BOY.: there aren't any crows are there? 
MAN.: yeah, just in books...

BOY.: can i ask you something?
MAN.: sure.
BOY.: are we going to die now?
MAN.: what do you think is going to happen? we're just going to suddenly keel over and die? it takes a long time to die of starvation. the important thing is water to stop you dehydrating. we've got water. we'll be all right.

MAN.: every day is a lie. but i am slowly dying. that is not a lie .i am trying to prepare him for the day when i am gone. 
MAN.: nothing you haven't seen before.

BOY.: we look skinny.

BOY.: i don't remember.
MAN.: before you were born. we had one just like it. it was beautiful.
BOY.: what happened to it?
MAN.: chopped it up for firewood.

WOMAN.: i used to worry what would happen if there was a fire. what would i save? what could i bear to lose? there used to be so many things, so many beautiful things. things people made. things nature made. 
MAN.: i'll strip the floorboards.
WOMAN.: you can't live without a floor.
MAN.: you can't live without a piano.
WOMAN.: it's my piano.
MAN.: i bought it for you.
WOMAN.: it needs tuning. who's going to tune it? can you tune it?

BOY.: sort of.

BOY.: what is it? 
MAN.: shh.
BOY: maybe it's a dog.
MAN: it's not a dog.
BOY.: it is! it's a dog! a dog!

MAN.: if it's a dog it'll be with someone. 
BOY.: who?
MAN.: i don't know.
MAN.: i'm not waiting to find out. come on. let's get out of here.
BOY.: i don't want to go.
MAN.: i know but it's not safe anymore.

BOY.: what are we going to do with all this stuff? 
MAN.: we'll just have to take what we can.
BOY.: i wish we could live here. and we could keep the dog and the dog could catch food for us.

MAN.: look, there is no dog, okay? i'm sorry but there just isn't. 
BOY.: well what is it!
MAN.: i don't know what it is!
BOY.: please papa.
MAN.: no.
BOY.: just say it's going to be all right, papa. say it. just say it, please.
MAN.: listen, trouble comes when you least expect it. so maybe the thing to do is to just always expect it.
BOY.: do you always expect it? papa?
MAN.: i do, yes.
BOY.: you always think bad things are going to happen but we found this place. maybe we'll find another place like this at the coast.
MAN.: maybe.

BOY.: what are you doing? 
MAN.: we'll have to cover our tracks from now on.

MAN.: i think they're following us. 
BOY.: who?
MAN.: i don't know.
BOY.: you think it's bad guys?
MAN.: probably.
BOY.: what if it's good guys?

OLD MAN.: i don't have anything for you. you can look if you want. i got nothing. 
MAN.: we're not robbers.
OLD MAN.: what?
MAN.: i said we're not robbers.
OLD MAN.: what are you?
MAN.: we're just like you.
OLD MAN.: what are you following me for?
MAN.: we're not following you.
BOY.: we've got food we could give him.

MAN.: he's not getting any food. the old man looks away, avoiding their eyes. 
BOY.: he's scared, papa.
MAN.: everybody's scared.
BOY.: please papa.

MAN.: if this is an ambush, he goes first. 
BOY.: take it. here.
BOY.: what about a spoon?
MAN.: he's not getting a spoon.
BOY.: eat it. it's good.

BOY.: look, papa. he's hungry. 
MAN.: i see it. and i know what you're going to ask me. and the answer is no.
BOY.: what's the question?
MAN.: we can't keep him.
MAN.: when did you last eat?
MAN.: do you want to eat with us?
OLD MAN.: i don't know. what do i have to do?
MAN.: tell us where the world went.
OLD MAN.: what?
MAN.: you don't have to do anything. can you walk okay?
OLD MAN.: i can walk.

BOY.: he can't see.
MAN.: don't.
MAN.: how old are you?
OLD MAN.: i'm ninety.
MAN.: ninety my ass! is that what you tell people? so they don't hurt you?
OLD MAN.: uh-huh.
MAN.: does it work?
OLD MAN.: nope.
MAN.: what's your name?
OLD MAN.: ely.
MAN.: just "ely?"
OLD MAN.: what's wrong with "ely?"

MAN.: how come you're still alive? what do you eat? 
OLD MAN.: i don't know. people give you things.
MAN.: no they don't.
OLD MAN.: you did.
MAN.: i didn't. he did.
OLD MAN.: are you a little boy?
MAN.: what does he look like?
OLD MAN.: i don't know. i can't see real good.
MAN.: is that right? can you see me?
OLD MAN.: no. but i can tell somebody's there.
MAN: okay. you need to sleep. come on.
OLD MAN.: i had a little boy once. gone... all gone...
MAN.: what happened to him?

OLD MAN.: i can't... i can't talk about that... leastways not with you i can't. 
MAN.: you can see that, right? okay. tell me now. you're not a shill for a pack of road agents?
OLD MAN.: i'm not anything. i'll go if you want me to. i can find the road.
OLD MAN.: i live like an animal. you don't want to know the things i've had to eat. when i saw that boy i thought i'd died and he was an angel. i never thought i'd see a child again. i never thought that would happen to me.
MAN.: he is an angel. to me he's a
OLD MAN.: well i hope that's not true. to be on the road with the last surviving would be a pretty frightening experience.
MAN.: why do you say that?
OLD MAN.: where men can't live, gods can't either. the road gangs would tear you limb from limb, both of you.
OLD MAN.: i knew this was coming. this or something like it.

OLD MAN.: there were warnings. people thought it was a con - i always believed in it. 
MAN.: did you try to get ready for it?
OLD MAN.: no. what would you do? even if you knew what to do you wouldn't know what to do. suppose you were the last man left alive?
MAN.: how would you know if you were the last man alive?
OLD MAN.: i don't guess you would know it.
MAN.: maybe would know.
OLD MAN.: if there is a up there he would have turned his back on us by now. whoever made humanity will find no humanity here.
MAN.: do you ever wish you would die?
OLD MAN.: no. it's foolish to ask for luxuries in times like these.

OLD MAN.: maybe i should and maybe i shouldn't. i wouldn't have given you anything. 
BOY.: he's going to die and you don't care.
MAN.: i care enough. maybe when we're out of food you'll have more time to think about it.
BOY.: you always say watch out for bad guys but that old man wasn't a bad guy and you can't even tell anymore.

MAN.: what's wrong? 
BOY.: i had a bad dream.
MAN.: what about?
BOY.: i don't want to tell you. just you.
MAN.: what happened to me?
MAN.: i tell him: when you dream about bad things happening it shows you're still fighting. you're still alive. it's when you start to dream about good things you should start to worry.

BOY.: do you think they're still following us? 
MAN.: i think they've been following us for a long time.
BOY-.: maybe it's ely - the old man?
MAN.: how? on a broom stick?

BOY.: what is it? 
MAN.: more smoke. i think we should take a look.
BOY.: i don't want to. let's just keep going.
MAN.: whoever it is i don't want them behind us.
BOY.: what if they're bad guys?
MAN.: what if they're good guys?
MAN.: look. whoever it is out there, it's better to know about it than to not know.
BOY.: why?
MAN.: because we don't like surprises.

MAN.: you know where we are? 
BOY.: no.
MAN.: where do you think?
MAN.: more.
BOY.: here?
MAN.: no. we're closer than you think.
MAN.: this is us. this is all sea.
BOY.: is it blue?
MAN-.: the sea? i don't know. it used to be.

MAN.: can you smell that? 
BOY.: it smells different.
MAN.: everything is going to be different.

MAN.: nothing. 
BOY.: there must be something.
MAN.: maybe there's a father and his little boy and they're sitting on the beach too.
BOY.: and they could be carrying the fire too?
MAN.: they could be, yes.

BOY.: what are our long term goals? 
MAN.: "what are our long term goals?" where did you hear that?
BOY.: i don't know. you said it.
MAN.: when?
BOY.: a long time ago.
MAN.: when your mother was here?
BOY.: i guess.
MAN.: and what was the answer?

BOY.: i don't know. 
MAN.: well, i don't either.
BOY.: can i go swimming?
MAN.: swimming? you'll freeze your nuts off.
BOY.: i know.
MAN.: i don't want to have to come in after you.

BOY.: how many people do you think are still alive? 
MAN.: in the world? i don't know. not very many.
BOY.: there could be people alive someplace else. besides on earth?

MAN.: i don't think so. they couldn't live any place else. 
BOY.: not even if they could get there?
MAN.: no. it's unlikely.
MAN.: are you all right? what is it?
BOY.: i don't feel so good.
BOY.: i'm sorry.
MAN.: that's okay, you didn't do anything wrong.

MAN.: it's okay. you're going to be okay.
