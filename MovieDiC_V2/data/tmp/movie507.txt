COLTER: ma'am? 
COLTER: excuse me... ma'am?
COLTER: what is this?
CHRISTINA: what's what?
COLTER: where am i?
CHRISTINA: almost at newark.
COLTER: what's newark? a city?

CHRISTINA: it's more of a hole. 
COLTER: woah.
COLTER: i think i'm going to puke.
CHRISTINA: okay, bathroom's that way.
CHRISTINA: go. seriously.

CONDUCTOR: ticket? 
CONDUCTOR: may i see your ticket?
COLTER: i don't think i...

CONDUCTOR: have to write you up then. 
COLTER: is this...?
COLTER: wait a sec. i'm a little out of it here. where's this train headed?
CONDUCTOR: new york. penn station.
COLTER: new york?
COLTER: do you know where i got on?
CONDUCTOR: princeton junction.
COLTER: where's that?
CONDUCTOR: "â˜bout ten minutes back.
COLTER: but i've never been to princeton junction. see... i don't remember waking up or buying a ticket or getting on the train or anything else. it's just a blank.
CONDUCTOR: lucky you.

COLTER: sean fentress? who the hell's that? 
COLTER: ma'am?
CHRISTINA: why do you keep calling me ma'am?
COLTER: i'm having a little problem here. i'm trying not to freak out, but i think something's happened to me.
CHRISTINA: like what?
COLTER: like, total memory loss. complete.
CHRISTINA: so you drank too much last night. so did i. unfortunately, i remember the whole thing.
COLTER: that's not it. see... i'm a pilot. i fly helicopters in iraq. i'm in the army.
COLTER: i was on a mission. right before i woke up here i was in the middle of a mission...
7.: wavering. unsure of himself. his memories.
CHRISTINA: boy, you really did drink a lot last night.
COLTER: i'm telling you the truth.
ANNOUNCER: now approaching newark station. newark station, next stop.
COLTER: these aren't my clothes. and this wallet here...
COLTER: you see this? this isn't me.
CHRISTINA: of course it is.
COLTER: what?
CHRISTINA: take a look in the mirror, good sir.
COLTER: this can't be happening.
ANNOUNCER: newark station.

ANNOUNCER: all aboard. doors are closing. 
ANNOUNCER: this is a new york bound train. next stop, new york - penn station.

9.: her hand knocks. 
CHRISTINA: hey. you okay in there?

CHRISTINA: you left your bag on the seat. which is a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. i probably saved you a huge fine. 
CHRISTINA: i'll just leave it right out here for you.

CHRISTINA: if it'll help you remember, you've been riding this train every morning for three months. 
COLTER: three months?!

GOODWIN: captain colter stevens, this is beleaguered castle. acknowledge transmission. 
GOODWIN: captain stevens, do you copy?
COLTER: where am i?
GOODWIN: you're with beleaguered castle.
GOODWIN: are you functional?
COLTER: i'm dizzy.
GOODWIN: adjusting your rotation.

GOODWIN: can you report at this time? 
COLTER: what is this? who am i talking to?
GOODWIN: report what you saw.
COLTER: when?
GOODWIN: just now.
COLTER: i was on a train.
GOODWIN: and?
COLTER: and... there was a bomb.
COLTER: what the is going on?!
GOODWIN: just relax, captain.

COLTER: who are you? 
GOODWIN: you already have that information, captain. now think. recall my name.
COLTER: goodwin?
GOODWIN: correct.
COLTER: how do i know that? i have no idea how i know your name's goodwin.
GOODWIN: commencing memory pattern.
COLTER: listen to me. something's wrong. i was flying a mission. i was in a chopper. then i woke up on a train. now i'm here. can you explain that? what unit is this?
GOODWIN: you're with beleaguered castle.
COLTER: who?
GOODWIN: you're with friends.
GOODWIN: the exercises will assist you. are you ready?
GOODWIN: memory thread one. listen to the following passage: "when lily woke, she had the bed to herself. she sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver.

GOODWIN: in the cold slant of light reflected from the back wall of a neighboring building, she saw her evening dress and opera cloak lying on a tawdry heap on a chair."â end of thread one. 
COLTER: i don't get it. is this a red flag exercise?
GOODWIN: thread two. listen. i am holding the following hand of cards: queen of spades. four of clubs. nine of clubs. three of hearts. nine of hearts.
GOODWIN: i repeat: queen of spades. four of clubs. nine of clubs. three of hearts. nine of hearts. end of thread two.
GOODWIN: thread three. the following is a recording of a western screech-owl:
GOODWIN: end of thread three. end of pattern. acknowledge.
COLTER: a... acknowledge. end of pattern.
GOODWIN: stand by to initiate pattern recall.
COLTER: go for pattern recall.

GOODWIN: the five playing cards. arrange them in order of descending values, irrespective of suit. 
COLTER: queen, two nines, four and a three.
GOODWIN: that is correct. the passage i read contained mention of a woman's name. what was that name?
COLTER: laurie.
COLTER: no. lily. her name was lily.
GOODWIN: that is correct. end of pattern.

GOODWIN: please list the primary specifications of the aerial platform you've been trained to operate. 
GOODWIN: please list the primary specifications of the aerial platform you've been trained to operate.
COLTER: is someone going to tell me what's going on here?
GOODWIN: please list the primary --
COLTER: the uh-60 blackhawk helicopter weighs 20,250 pounds with a maximum exterior load capacity of 8,000 pounds. it has a range of 320 nautical miles and is armed with two 7.62 millimeter machine guns.
GOODWIN: that is correct.
GOODWIN: who bombed the train?
COLTER: the train.
GOODWIN: who bombed the train, captain?
COLTER: i have no idea.

GOODWIN: whom do you suspect bombed the train? 
COLTER: i don't know!
GOODWIN: you didn't see?
COLTER: will you tell me what the is going on here?
GOODWIN: the screech-owl song can be seen as a progression of musical notes. did the notes go up, down or remain at the same pitch?
COLTER: i don't know. just tell me --
GOODWIN: how many times was the bird call repeated?
COLTER: what does this have to do with the train?
GOODWIN: how many times was the bird call repeated?
COLTER: twice.
GOODWIN: incorrect. who bombed the train, captain?
COLTER: i don't know who bombed the train!
GOODWIN: you have seventeen minutes. use them. find the bomber.

COLTER: hey. what's happening? 
COLTER: it, goodwin, what is all this?

A TRAIN WINDOW: at the passing woodland scenery. 
20.: is goodwin watching him from somewhere?

COLTER: it's a simulation. 
COLTER: a three dimensional, completely immersive scenario. touch, taste, sound, sight and smell.
CHRISTINA: are you talking to me?
COLTER: complete with pretty girl.
CHRISTINA: pretty girl.
COLTER: every combat simulator has one. in the middle of a fire fight a pop-up window starts playing a porno.
COLTER: you're an unusual choice for a distraction.
CHRISTINA: and you're a moron.
COLTER: find the bomber. find the bomber.

CONDUCTOR: ticket? 
COLTER: everything okay today, chief?
CONDUCTOR: say what?
COLTER: anything out of the ordinary?
CONDUCTOR: please take a seat, sir.
DEREK: trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed...

COLTER: how's it going? 
COLTER: what's your name?
CONDUCTOR: didn't i tell you to take a seat?
COLTER: goodwin? where are you? it's over. i found him.
CONDUCTOR: who are you talking to?
COLTER: sorry. this guy seemed a little...
GUZMAN: i am minding my business. tell him to mind his.

CONDUCTOR: you feeling all right, sir? 
GUZMAN: motion sickness, i'm afraid. i believe i will get off at the next stop.
CONDUCTOR: very well.
COLTER: okay. i'm sitting down.
ANNOUNCER: now approaching newark station. newark station, next stop. the train begins to slow down.
COLLEGE STUDENT: hey, you dropped this.
DEREK: relieved, takes back the
WALLET): wow. thanks.

GUZMAN: excuse me... please let me through... 
COLTER: he's running away.
ANNOUNCER: newark station.
ANNOUNCER: all aboard. doors are closing.

COLTER: a guy just came through here. did you see where he went? 
CLERK: lots of guys come through here.
COLTER: he was just here. a middle eastern- looking guy.

ANNOUNCER: the train to philadelphia will be four minutes late... the train to philadelphia will be four minutes late... 
COLTER: all better now?
COLTER: don't much care for trains myself.

COLTER: how are you going to pull this off? that bomb has a cell phone detonator. and i don't see a pay phone around here. so i'm betting you got a phone on you with the number already programmed in. 
GUZMAN: i have no idea what you're talking about. i am an international business man. an executive.
COLTER: open your briefcase. prove to me there's no phone in there.

GUZMAN: i will prove nothing to you. leave me alone. 
COLTER: "hasnan guzman, vice president, shell oil."â must be a cover.
ANNOUNCER: philadelphia train now approaching.
COLTER: where the hell's your phone?
COLTER: i thought so. now let's see you try to --
THE EXPRESS TRAIN: closing in on the station.

COLTER: holy 
GOODWIN: stabilize. lower your pulse.
GOODWIN: do you need to urinate?
COLTER: a train just ran over me.

GOODWIN: do you need to urinate? 
COLTER: how are you doing this? am i on some kind of drug?
GOODWIN: did you find the bomber?
COLTER: i didn't find the bomber. you fooled me with the middle eastern guy. i went for the diversion. what kind of freaky simulation is this? let me out of here!
GOODWIN: which middle eastern guy? be specific.
COLTER: guzman. shell oil. look, i don't have intel experience. why do you have me doing this?
GOODWIN: you've already been told what you need to know. discipline your memory. limit your operational awareness to the tasks we assign you. everything else is irrelevant.
COLTER: irrelevant? killing me each time is irrelevant?
GOODWIN: you do not die. as you can see, you simply return to us.
COLTER: how? how can you do that?
COLTER: who's the man with the pipe?
GOODWIN: say again?

COLTER: there was a man smoking a pipe. i saw him on the monitor. who's he? 
GOODWIN: the man with the pipe isn't here right now.
COLTER: let me talk to him. this isn't right. i'm not your prisoner.
GOODWIN: you feel unsatisfied with our relationship?
COLTER: what is this? why are you talking like that? is this some kind of script?
GOODWIN: if guzman, the middle eastern man, is innocent, as you maintain, who might be the guilty party?
COLTER: who cares? i'm tired of this.
GOODWIN: this isn't a game, captain.
COLTER: then what is it? don't you already know who the bomber is? don't you have all the answers?
GOODWIN: we have no answers. only corpses.
COLTER: corpses? whose corpses? the passengers?
GOODWIN: some were too badly burned to be identified.

GOODWIN: the heat from the explosion fused many of them completely into the wreckage. 
COLTER: these were real people?
GOODWIN: yes.
COLTER: this really happened?
GOODWIN: yes.
COLTER: when?
GOODWIN: today.
COLTER: today?! the train blew up today?
GOODWIN: it was attacked this morning, at 7:57 a.m., eastern standard time. six miles outside of new york city.
COLTER: you're lying. i don't believe it.
GOODWIN: what do your senses tell you?
COLTER: where am i, right now, as we speak?
GOODWIN: with beleaguered castle.
COLTER: my unit's still in iraq. i'm flying missions in iraq. i flew one yesterday!

GOODWIN: your unit was rotated stateside three weeks ago. 
COLTER: then why do i still have iraqi dirt underneath my fingernails?
COLTER: talk to me! three weeks? i've been back three weeks? how'd i get in here? have i seen my family? does my father know i'm home? "â˜cause i'd kinda like to tell him if that's the case.
GOODWIN: listen up, soldier.
GOODWIN: the train is just the beginning. our intel says there are more attacks are coming today. and they're linked with the train. time is of the essence. do you understand?
GOODWIN: captain?
COLTER: i'm listening.
GOODWIN: d.n.i. counterterrorism has come up with the five most likely follow-up targets in the new york area.

GOODWIN: they are, in no order of importance, the holland tunnel, newark international airport, the brooklyn bridge, penn station and the empire state building. it could be any of them, it could be none of them. whatever it is, if you find the bomber and learn his plan, the next one we might be in a position to prevent. those are your orders. 
COLTER: wait. if i'm somehow on that train before it blows up, why don't i just dismantle the bomb?
GOODWIN: those are not your orders.
COLTER: but all those people dying...
GOODWIN: those are not your orders. you are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission.
COLTER: i didn't volunteer for this
GOODWIN: would you like to see the release form you signed?
COLTER: how do i know it's real? how do i know you didn't force me to sign it? and how the can i be put on a train over and over again -- a train i never was really on?!
COLTER: i don't believe in time travel, goodwin. there's no such thing.

GOODWIN: only one way forward, captain. 
COLTER: why seventeen? why me? why anything?
COLTER: let me out! don't send me back there!

COLTER: this is not happening. 
CHRISTINA: ain't life grand?
COLTER: you an artist?
CHRISTINA: i went to art school. doesn't make me an artist.
COLTER: can i see what you're working on?
35.: her pencil pauses. she eyes colter.
CHRISTINA: i'd rather not.
COLTER: you don't look like you belong here. the way you're dressed.
CHRISTINA: you certainly do.
COLTER: i'd really like to see what you're working on. unless you're worried i won't like it.
CHRISTINA: it's private. and your opinion doesn't interest me.
COLTER: so you scribble away on that thing so as not to deal with people.
COLTER: they're amazing.
CHRISTINA: i wouldn't go that far.
COLTER: seriously, they're really good, miss...?
CHRISTINA: christina.
COLTER: my name's colter. how many of these passengers have you drawn?

CHRISTINA: all of them, practically. 
CHRISTINA: i know all about them.
COLTER: you know all about them?
CHRISTINA: i'm a collector of moments.
CHRISTINA: that woman over there? she's a patent attorney with three kids and a summer place on long island. more important, however, she colors her hair herself and wears the same houndstooth check suit every third wednesday. the nebbishy fellow behind her always calls into his office three minutes before we go into the tunnel. and the guy with the shaved head and leather jacket eating a scone has a profile identical to that of julius caesar.
COLTER: what about that guy?
CHRISTINA: i haven't seen him before today.
CHRISTINA: he's cranky. thinks the worst of people.
COLTER: dangerous?
CHRISTINA: everyone's dangerous.
COLTER: you see anything unusual happen this morning? anything out of the ordinary?

CHRISTINA: i'm not sure i know what you mean. 
COLTER: has anyone else come out of that bathroom that you remember?
CHRISTINA: who are you?
COLTER: don't you know? haven't you seen me here every day for, what, three months?
CHRISTINA: something's different about you today.
COLTER: if i told you that there's a terrorist on this train, that i was sent here to catch him, would you believe me?
CHRISTINA: most fervently.
COLTER: then tell me which one you'd arrest.
CHRISTINA: they're all so utterly normal. that's what's terrifying about them. perhaps there's more than one. a team at work. the patent attorney in cahoots with julius caesar and the nebbishy guy. and don't forget the sullen college kid. he's the expendable one. but they're all controlled by this good- looking stock broker.

CHRISTINA: blond, blue eyed, hyper alert. the perfect machiavellian operative. out for himself. he'll betray them all in the end. 
COLTER: never mind.
ANNOUNCER: now approaching newark station. newark station, next stop.
CHRISTINA: he's getting away...!
COLTER: thanks for your help, ma'am.
CHRISTINA: ma'am? how old do you think i am?
COLTER: i don't know. thirty two?

COLTER: what happened, fentress? who are you? how can i be you? 
COLTER: "caoc-n."â what unit is that?

CHRISTINA: who were you talking to? 
COLTER: leave me alone.
CHRISTINA: my pleasure, okay? it's just that you left your bag on your seat. it's a flagrant violation of rail security, leaving a suspicious package behind and all that. maybe you're the terrorist.

COLTER: terrorist? why did you say that? 
CHRISTINA: i was joking.
COLTER: stop joking. who are you? are you an operative?
CHRISTINA: i had no idea you were so thoroughly weird. i'm not entirely sure i like it.
COLTER: why do you have sketches of everybody on board? are you part of this?
CHRISTINA: part of what?
COLTER: i can have you arrested. maybe that's the only way you'll drop the and talk. stay put. i'm getting help.
CHRISTINA: who am i? i'll tell you. i'm twenty seven years old. i have no savings and no health insurance.
CHRISTINA: six months ago i moved back in with my parents because i ran out of money. i got a's in line drawing and advanced oil painting but no one's buying my stuff. two weeks ago i put away all my paints. my little sketch book is the last thing left. you see, i'm not a artist. i'm a receptionist in a law firm. the only thing i operate is a phone switchboard.
41.: the stark reality of her life.
CHRISTINA: now let me tell you about you. you work at the new york public library. you've been eyeing me for months on this train but haven't said a word to me. you're bland and colorless and predictable. and now i see you're delusional, too.

COLTER: son of a "caoc-n."â that's not army. that's air force. combined air and space operations center. nellis air force base! 
CHRISTINA: are you mocking me?
COLTER: they're running this whole thing out of nellis air force base in nevada. nevada!
COLTER: what's there? what's on that base? b-52s. kc tankers. air combat command. predator drones. remote operations. this a remote operation.
COLTER: what if it is time travel?

COLTER: what did he say? 
CHRISTINA: do me a favor. don't ever talk to me again.

COLTER: christina! he grabs her -- she struggles against him -- 
CHRISTINA: get off me!

COLTER: goodwin? what's happening? come in. can you read me? it's cold in here. 
COLTER: goodwin, i'm losing oxygen.
COLTER: goodwin!

COLTER: come on! 
GOODWIN: -- four principle dialects of arabic: egyptian, gulf, syrian- lebanese and north african. we will now play you portions of each, discussing the audible differences between them. clips of spoken arabic begin to play.

COLTER: can you hear me? 
RUTLEDGE: project designer initiating sequence and drives check.
COLTER: i'm here! i'm okay!
RUTLEDGE: is someone there?
COLTER: yeah. it's me. colter.
RUTLEDGE: wow! it's you.
COLTER: the capsule lost power. it's still pretty cold in here.
RUTLEDGE: we've been working towards you from the other side. nice to have you with us again. you feeling all right?

COLTER: i think so. who are you? 
RUTLEDGE: the name's rutledge.
COLTER: they wouldn't let me talk to you before.
RUTLEDGE: no, i guess not. they're pretty around here. don't tell them you saw me smoking in here, okay?
COLTER: you're the inventor of this thing.
RUTLEDGE: i prefer the term project designer. and sorry for all the secrecy. goodwin will be thrilled you re- established contact.
COLTER: i don't want to deal with goodwin anymore.
RUTLEDGE: what?
COLTER: don't you understand? he's torturing me. i'm helpless. can't you get me out of here?
RUTLEDGE: why would goodwin have it in for you?

COLTER: he's a remote operator. and remote operators are risk averse who sit at control screens in the rear while actual pilots like me put their on the line in the field. 
RUTLEDGE: he seems pretty devoted to the mission.
COLTER: and just what kind of mission is this? talk to me, man. why won't he let me save those people on the train?
RUTLEDGE: because they can't be saved.
COLTER: why not? i know what's going to happen. i could take apart the bomb. stop the train.
RUTLEDGE: yeah but you'd be doing it in the source code, not here. not in our own past.
COLTER: what's the difference?
RUTLEDGE: i'm not sure i should be telling you this.
COLTER: telling me what?
RUTLEDGE: it's quantum physics. linear algebra. parabolic calculus. it would take weeks to explain.
COLTER: is source code time travel?
48.: rutledge sighs. looks at his pipe.
RUTLEDGE: it's gone out again.
COLTER: why can't i save those people on the train?
RUTLEDGE: think of it like this: events in our past can never be undone.
COLTER: so...
RUTLEDGE: so source code opens up another past for you. a parallel past. it looks the same but it has no intersection with our own world. in essence, by sending you back, an entirely new but utterly parallel world is created. it looks identical to ours, but nothing you do there has any effect on this reality.
COLTER: what happens to the source code world after i leave it?
RUTLEDGE: i don't know. you can never know that because you're not there to observe it. maybe it vanishes.
RUTLEDGE: i should tell them you're okay.
COLTER: what about the bicycle?
RUTLEDGE: what bicycle?
COLTER: i see it each time. right after the bomb goes off. like an after image.

COLTER: there's a bicycle and a stone wall and a girl. it's a girl from the train. i don't know where any of it is supposed to be, but -- rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth. 
RUTLEDGE: wait. you see all this after you leave the train?
COLTER: yeah. just for a split second.
RUTLEDGE: please tell me you're not making this up.
COLTER: no. it's there. what do you think it means?
RUTLEDGE: i don't know.
RUTLEDGE: they're here. there's no more time to talk.
RUTLEDGE: make sure he sends you back in. find out about the after images.
COLTER: rutledge, wait. don't leave me.
GOODWIN: welcome back. how are you feeling?
COLTER: i'm alive. no thanks to you.
GOODWIN: you find the bomber?

COLTER: you're a brick wall, goodwin. a brick wall. 
GOODWIN: lower your pulse. the situation has worsened. the fire on the tracks caused one of the freight cars to blow up and release some kind of gas. as a precaution they're having to evacuate all of lower manhattan.
GOODWIN: we may have lost the initiative.
COLTER: what do you mean? let's keep going.
GOODWIN: we were expecting more from you.
COLTER: i can give you more. let me think for a second.
COLTER: the freight car blows up from the fire. it spews gas, or what could be gas -- it might be chlorine, so they can't take any chances.
COLTER: so they decide to play it safe and evacuate parts of new york city. and maybe that's part of the terrorists' plan, right?
COLTER: so... so who benefits from that? what's vulnerable? what's down there in lower manhattan?
COLTER: wall street.
51.: surprising himself with this insight.
COLTER: wall street. that's what they're going to hit next. the financial markets.
GOODWIN: i want to show you something.

COLTER: did she die, too? 
GOODWIN: yes. this drivers license photo was found with her body. we're creating a database of recovered identifications as they come in from the site.
COLTER: you sure she's dead?
GOODWIN: would you like to see her morgue photos?
COLTER: she was sitting across from me.
GOODWIN: we know.

GOODWIN: this was taken shortly after the rescue crews arrived on scene. 
GOODWIN: we noted the location of each corpse when we pulled it out.
GOODWIN: prepare yourself. this is unedited footage.
COLTER: i told you i didn't want to see her!
COLTER: that's...
GOODWIN: sean fentress.
COLTER: he died on the train.
GOODWIN: as a host identity, sean fentress had to have certain basic similarities to you. gender. blood type. approximate age. his head was still intact. we need the head, you see. to link the two of you remotely.

GOODWIN: would you like to see the other passenger photos? perhaps that would help you. 
COLTER: you still have christina's body?
GOODWIN: why?
COLTER: i want to know about her. everything i can. she's not just another victim. she's connected to all this.

COLTER: thirty six dollars and eleven cents. 
COLTER: in your wallet. right now. thirty six dollars and eleven cents.
CHRISTINA: is this a magic trick or something?

COLTER: we're about to pass a street with willow trees. two girls will be jumping rope. a white dog's going to run out behind them. a dalmatian mix. 
CHRISTINA: you want to tell me how you're doing this?
COLTER: close observation. you could say i'm a collector of moments.
CHRISTINA: a collector of moments?
COLTER: yes.
CHRISTINA: that's the cheesiest line i've ever heard.
COLTER: you trained to be an artist.
COLTER: you got a's in line drawing and oil painting. but your work didn't sell. you took a job answering phones in a law firm.

COLTER: six months ago you moved back in with your parents. two weeks ago you put your paints away for good. the sketch book is all you have left. 
CHRISTINA: who the are you? who have you been talking to?
COLTER: you.
CHRISTINA: me? no. i haven't ever talked to you.
COLTER: but we have, christina. you've drawn all these people here. you know their routines. at one point you thought you were different from all of them. but now you're not so sure.

CHRISTINA: okay, you've got my attention. now tell me what this is all about. 
COLTER: i need your help.
CHRISTINA: are you selling something?
COLTER: listen to me. i can't use up any more time trying to convince you. i just need you to believe everything i'm about to tell you.
CHRISTINA: this better be good.

COLTER: bear with me. your sketch book. is there a drawing of me in there? 
CHRISTINA: i'm not sure.
COLTER: please, christina.
CHRISTINA: yes, fine! here.
CHRISTINA: i did it last week.
COLTER: the thing is, that's not me.
CHRISTINA: give me a little credit.
COLTER: no. you drew what you saw, but the person you're seeing now is someone else. i'm not sean fentress. i'm not really on this train.
CHRISTINA: you're not really on this train.
COLTER: i'm taking someone's place. borrowing it. my name is colter. i'm a soldier. and i'm being held prisoner. and this is the only way -- the only time and place i have -- to figure out how to escape.
CHRISTINA: after three months of riding the train, this is how you introduce yourself to me?

COLTER: i'm serious. elements in the american military are using me for an experiment. i'm not sure exactly how it all happened, but i'm at a facility on nellis air force base in nevada. right now. as we speak. it's a project called source code. 
CHRISTINA: source code.
COLTER: it's a program. it shifts identities. it also performs small amounts of time travel. or "time engineering."â i don't know the jargon.
COLTER: i've been put on this train to look for someone. a criminal. and i need to find out just enough about him to keep them putting me back on this train. because right here's only place i can figure out what's really happening. but i have very little time. and each time i come back, you won't remember me and i'll have to go through this all over again.
CHRISTINA: you are, i think, deliciously mad.
COLTER: then how do i know all those things about you if we've never spoken before?
CHRISTINA: why tell all this to me? there's lots of people around for you to talk to.
COLTER: because i think you have the answer to this whole thing.

CHRISTINA: believe me, i don't have the answer for anything. 
COLTER: there's a vision. i keep having it. it's very powerful. and you're in it. and there's a bicycle. and this... old stone wall. and it's very peaceful. does this sound familiar? like where you live, maybe?
CHRISTINA: stone walls? my parents live in a house with aluminum siding and an american eagle over the door. the only bike is a harley which the guy down the street revs at three in the morning.
COLTER: the vision must mean something. it's the only time when i'm not on the train or in the capsule. why else would rutledge be so interested?
CHRISTINA: who's rutledge?
COLTER: someone who was trying to help me understand something. until they got to him.
ANNOUNCER: now approaching newark station. newark station, next stop. colter looks at his watch. ten minutes left.
CHRISTINA: i saw a program on tv. it was about psychics. they say psychics have a lot of paranoia.
COLTER: i don't believe in that

ANNOUNCER: newark station. 
ANNOUNCER: all aboard. doors are closing.
CHRISTINA: don't you have people you can go to for help? friends, family?
ANNOUNCER: this is a new york bound train.
COLTER: most of my friends are in the military. my dad runs a melon farm in alabama.
CHRISTINA: maybe now's the time to reach out to him.
COLTER: me and my dad, we don't see eye to eye. we're just two different people.
CHRISTINA: as opposed to being the exact same person?
COLTER: are you always this sarcastic?
CHRISTINA: this is so not about me.
COLTER: what day is it?
CHRISTINA: june 11th.

COLTER: june? 
DONALD: hello?
COLTER: dad?
COLTER: dad, it's me. it's colter.
COLTER: been a while, huh? i'd been meaning to call you, but --
COLTER: he wanted me to stay on and take over the farm but... i had other ideas.
CHRISTINA: you're intimidated by him.
COLTER: what?
CHRISTINA: you're scared of him. i can see it.
COLTER: the i am.
COLTER: dad, don't hang up. we're going to talk. i need your help.

CHRISTINA: he's still mad at you, huh? 
COLTER: no... it was like he didn't even know who i was.
CHRISTINA: i don't know how to help you.
COLTER: sorry to have bothered you.

CHRISTINA: i have a friend. 
CHRISTINA: she works at the new york times. her name's stephanie. she's just a proofreader, but she wants to be made a reporter. she's always saying she needs a good story to bring in so she gets noticed. something like this, with a crazy paranoid angle could really interest her.
COLTER: forget it.

CHRISTINA: she could do some poking around. she's already quite suspicious of the government. 
CHRISTINA: i'm getting voice mail. steph, it's christina. you know that story you're always looking to write? i might just have something for you. i met a guy. his name is colter stevens. he says he's in the army. he flies helicopters in iraq, but now they've put him into a secret project called source code. maybe you can look into it a bit, okay? call me.
CHRISTINA: she'll call back. just wait.
COLTER: thank you, ma'am.
CHRISTINA: ma'am? how old do you think i am?
COLTER: twenty five?
CHRISTINA: no, but thanks.
CHRISTINA: what did you mean, there's a criminal on the train? how do you know that?

COLTER: i just do. 
CHRISTINA: how can i help you if you don't tell me everything about this?

COLTER: you said you wanted to know. 
CHRISTINA: can't you just tell me?
CHRISTINA: try anything and i'll kill you.
COLTER: shut the door.
CHRISTINA: what are you doing?
COLTER: it's up here.
COLTER: just look.

CHRISTINA: is that...? 
COLTER: acetone peroxide. it's a liquid explosive. there's fourteen cannisters of it. simple detonator. cell phone signal closes the circuit and boom.
CHRISTINA: did you put this here?
COLTER: no. it was someone else. they don't know who. that's why i'm here. to find out.
CHRISTINA: we have to tell someone. we have to stop this.

COLTER: it won't matter. the train's already... 
CHRISTINA: already what?
COLTER: i've been sent here. it sounds crazy, but it's true. i've been sent from the future -- from five hours in the future. this train's already been blown up.
COLTER: you wanted to know. now you know.

CHRISTINA: this isn't happening. i've got to get off. 
CHRISTINA: why won't it open?!
CHRISTINA: it's steph.
CHRISTINA: i told you she'd be interested.
CHRISTINA: hi.

CHRISTINA: colter...? 
CHRISTINA: colter, i have to tell you something.

COLTER: look. now the thing can't go off. 
HIS WATCH: reads 20 seconds.
CHRISTINA: stephanie did a computer search.
CHRISTINA: she's got a database of all newspaper articles going back to forever.
COLTER: source code's classified. it wouldn't be in a newspaper.
CHRISTINA: no. but you were. she found you.
COLTER: she found me? what does that mean? she stops. not wanting to go on.
COLTER: christ, christina, are you going to spit it out?
CHRISTINA: according to the notice, you were killed in action two months ago. the world stops.

SOLDIER: never any leg room on a plane. 
FLIGHT MEDIC: hey, this guy's crashing...
FADE TO BLACK.: silence and darkness. nothingness.

GOODWIN: captain...? 
GOODWIN: captain, allow me to introduce myself. my name is goodwin. you're with beleaguered castle. you are safe. all your needs will be met here.

GOODWIN: captain, just tell me what you see. just look and speak. 
COLTER: i see a card.
GOODWIN: very good. very, very good.

GOODWIN: are you comfortable? are you warm? 
GOODWIN: do you need to urinate?
GOODWIN: beleaguered castle is waiting for your report.
COMPUTER VOICE: hearing test. first sequence. left ear.
COMPUTER VOICE: hearing test. first sequence. right ear.
GOODWIN: captain, i know you can hear me. did you find the bomber?
COMPUTER VOICE: memory thread one: "when lily woke, she had the bed to herself. she sat up, bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings; then memory returned, and she looked about her with a shiver."â goodwin stops the audio.
GOODWIN: as you're collecting your thoughts, i should tell you there's been another development. a terrorist group has taken responsibility for bombing the train.

MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER: on camera, in accented 
ENGLISH): by now you have suffered a taste of divine vengeance. willing, you will soon suffer another.
MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER: these attacks will show you that you will never be safe. you can secure your borders. but what can you do against one of your own citizens? one who looks like you, who is blameless, living already among you, who takes eighty million of our dollars, a trifle, and carries out our bidding? you cannot stop this. time has run out.
COLTER: let me talk to rutledge.
GOODWIN: so you've decided to speak.
COLTER: rutledge. get him.

GOODWIN: we appreciate your desire for further discussion. perhaps at a later date. 
COLTER: will you let me out of here?
GOODWIN: frankly, captain, we're disappointed.
COLTER: find rutledge! now!
GOODWIN: i have to say that we expected more from you.
COLTER: stop! stop reading from your script!
GOODWIN: perhaps we overestimated your abilities.
COLTER: i swear to christ!
GOODWIN: please accept the criticism in the spirit it was given. perhaps a few memory exercises would help.
COLTER: i don't need your criticism and i don't need your memory exercises, you gutless freak. and by the way, that bomb is detonated by a cell phone. when activated, the phone's display screen displays caller id information. caller id. i wonder if that information would be useful to beleaguered castle.

GOODWIN: very well. we're ready for that information. 
COLTER: you'll have to send me back. i didn't get a good look at it. but i will next time.
GOODWIN: what assurance do we have you'll be able to read the screen before the device detonates?
COLTER: goodwin, there's no time left. send... me... back.

OPERATOR: operator. city and listing. 
COLTER: las vegas, nevada. nellis air force base.
OPERATOR: connecting you.

POST OPERATOR: post operator. 
COLTER: is this... nellis air force base?
POST OPERATOR: yes, sir. how may i direct your call?
COLTER: i'm trying to reach... captain colter stevens.
POST OPERATOR: i have no listing for a captain colter stevens.
COLTER: then give me the combined air and space ops center.
POST OPERATOR: one moment, sir.
VOICE: c deck.
COLTER: who is this?
VOICE: c deck.
COLTER: i'm calling for rutledge. it's urgent.
VOICE: you have the wrong number.
COLTER: this is captain colter stevens.

VOICE: would you repeat that? 
COLTER: colter stevens. captain colter stevens.
VOICE: hold the line.
ANNOUNCER: now approaching newark station. newark station, next stop.
GOODWIN: captain? this is goodwin.
GOODWIN: where are you, captain?
COLTER: let me talk to rutledge.
GOODWIN: where are you? how did you find us?
COLTER: i'm on the train.
ANNOUNCER: newark station.
GOODWIN: what train?
COLTER: you don't know. it hasn't happened yet.
GOODWIN: what hasn't happened?

COLTER: the explosion. 
GOODWIN: what explosion?
ANNOUNCER: all aboard. doors are closing.
COLTER: don't you understand? i'm in it, goodwin. i'm calling you from inside the mission. inside the source code.
ANNOUNCER: next stop new york penn station.
GOODWIN: this contact is ill-advised. i must ask you to hang up.
COLTER: goodwin, i'm trapped in this and i can't get out.
GOODWIN: you have no authorization to be making this call. goodbye.
COLTER: no! wait! don't hang up! forget authorization. there's no time. soon you're going to find out what happened on this train. and then your own day is going to start. but not until then. right now it's just you and me talking. and you're a different goodwin than the one i'm going to go back to in a few minutes. you're separate from him. separate worlds. do you understand?
GOODWIN: i think so.
COLTER: good. now there's a lot of secrecy in all of this, and you have your reasons for that.

COLTER: but here and now, just this once, i need to ask you something. and you need to tell me the truth. 
GOODWIN: i'd rather you not ask me anything, captain.
COLTER: i'm going to ask it.
GOODWIN: i should terminate this call.
COLTER: goodwin, how can i get through to you? you're not just a soldier. somewhere inside you're a human being, too. somewhere inside you've got to know that this is wrong. source code is wrong. and if you can't grasp that, if you just follow orders, then you're just as much a prisoner as i am.
GOODWIN: what's your question?
COLTER: did i survive that helicopter crash in iraq?
COLTER: answer me. did i survive that crash?
COLTER: goodwin.
GOODWIN: not physically.
COLTER: what?

GOODWIN: you did not physically survive the crash. 
COLTER: not physically? at least give me an answer i can understand.
GOODWIN: we've kept alive certain areas of your brain.
COLTER: but... the capsule i'm in...
GOODWIN: a manifestation. your way of making sense of it. this is crushing. colter fights back terror.
COLTER: you had no right.
GOODWIN: as a soldier...
COLTER: i was a soldier. then. but now?
COLTER: after death?
GOODWIN: it was the only way. you couldn't have a body and be sent back into the source code.
GOODWIN: what is the status of your mission?
COLTER: you really want to know?
GOODWIN: i suppose not. you're right to keep it from me.
COLTER: that's what we do. keep stuff from each other. will this ever end?

GOODWIN: end? 
COLTER: how can i get out of this?
GOODWIN: you must realizes the army's made an investment in you. you'll be used again.
COLTER: how?
GOODWIN: imagine a turntable. with a record spinning on it. all we do is lift up the needle. the music stops.
COLTER: and then what?
GOODWIN: then we wait. until another mission. and the needle comes down again. you won't remember any of this. we'll start with the playing cards. electronic tones. simple memory exercises. bit by bit, we'll revive your cerebral capacities once more.
COLTER: how many times have i done this?
GOODWIN: does it matter?
COLTER: no one knows i'm here. no one can help me.
GOODWIN: in stimulating your cortex, they're prolonging your life. many soldiers would find that preferable to death.
COLTER: you can't do this. i served my country. i already gave my life.

GOODWIN: the courts. 
COLTER: what?
GOODWIN: the courts know you're here.
COLTER: military court or civilian court?
GOODWIN: military.
GOODWIN: i'm sorry you found out about all of this. that wasn't our intention.
COLTER: does that make it any less wrong?

RUTLEDGE: how's it going? any breakthroughs? 
COLTER: i finally get it, rutledge. you're the good guy, goodwin's the bad guy. working together, you get what you want out of me. why didn't i see it before?
RUTLEDGE: believe me, captain, i'm on your side.
COLTER: drop it. i know about the helicopter crash. i know what they've done with me.
RUTLEDGE: look, it's been a long day. for all of us. but now we've got to bring this home and catch a killer.
COLTER: what's in it for me?
RUTLEDGE: come on. these guys are serious. help me out. my is on the line, too, you know.
COLTER: you can do better than that. they sent you here to offer me a deal.
RUTLEDGE: if you think i'm enjoying this, you're wrong.
COLTER: what's their offer? what can they possibly threaten me with after so colossally me? spit it out, you spineless turd.

RUTLEDGE: the government can decide to take an interest in people. people like your father with his struggling farm. it can discover things like unpaid property taxes. it can call in his equipment loans or tie him down for years in environmental litigation. on the other hand, it can pay him handsomely for mineral deposits he never knew were there. as distant and problematic as your relationship was, surely you'd like the chance to do something for him. 
COLTER: those after images i saw. you never knew about them. they weren't part of source code architecture, were they?
RUTLEDGE: they're meaningless. nerves firing. brain chemistry.
COLTER: you don't believe that. i've been to places you haven't. i've crossed and recrossed that line between living and dying. and when i do, that veil gets lifted for just a second. and what's there is real. maybe it's a vision of the next world, but i can see it.
RUTLEDGE: you can see it. but you can never get there without our help.
COLTER: get there? what do you mean?
RUTLEDGE: our offer. maybe we can get you there. in return for your completing the mission.
RUTLEDGE: they'll let you die. i'll shut off your life support and you'll simply slip away.

RUTLEDGE: just like the good lord intended you to do a few months back. 
COLTER: you'd never do it. you wouldn't have to. you could just flip the switch and start me back up again unaware. for all i know, you've made this deal with me before.
RUTLEDGE: actually, we haven't. your operational awareness has become too great. if you found out the truth about yourself once, you might do so again. as for source code, i'm sure we can find other servicemen coming back from overseas with wounds just like yours.
RUTLEDGE: do you have the courage to serve your country one final time?
COLTER: i'm going to find you, rutledge.
RUTLEDGE: retreating from the
CONFRONTATION): the display screen on the detonator was a useful and exciting insight you made. this time, make it pay off. get the information on the screen. but let the bomb explode. we need the force of the explosion to help integrate you quickly back into the present.
COLTER: you hear me? somehow, i'm going to find you.
RUTLEDGE: i doubt that.

RUTLEDGE: captain? 
RUTLEDGE: it's okay. calm yourself. you're back.
RUTLEDGE: what happened?
RUTLEDGE: was the bomber's identity on the cell phone?
COLTER: i think so. but there wasn't time to read the screen. as soon as it rang the bomb went off.
RUTLEDGE: what about the phone itself? make, model, product identification number.
COLTER: i was unable examine the phone without separating it from the detonator -- which i was instructed not to do.

RUTLEDGE: did you make any other progress? what in heck's name did you do for those seventeen minutes? colter does not answer. 
COLTER: wait. what are you --
THUNK.: again, he convulses and goes limp.
RUTLEDGE: we can do this all day. until you get it right.
COLTER: please... i don't feel good...
RUTLEDGE: i don't doubt it. who's the bomber?
COLTER: i don't know... i honestly... i can't keep...

CHRISTINA: you want to get off me? 
COLTER: go ahead! open your soda!
CHRISTINA: what's wrong with you, anyway?

CHRISTINA: you okay? 
CHRISTINA: you're not okay.
COLTER: ma'am, please... return to your seat.
CONDUCTOR: ticket.

CONDUCTOR: ticket, please. 
CHRISTINA: he's not feeling well.
CONDUCTOR: he still needs a ticket.
CONDUCTOR: have it your way, pal.
CHRISTINA: wait. i'll pay it.
CONDUCTOR: i have no idea where he got on.
CHRISTINA: all right, all right.
CHRISTINA: i see customer service is alive and well on new jersey transit.
COLTER: why did you just do that?
CHRISTINA: the ticket? i don't know. you looked a little lost.
COLTER: will you do me a favor?
CHRISTINA: what's that?

COLTER: get off the train. 
CHRISTINA: what?
ANNOUNCER: now approaching newark station.
COLTER: please. just get off the train.
CHRISTINA: this isn't my stop.
COLTER: you shouldn't have been on this train, christina. you should be living another life. not spending it answering phones for lawyers.
CHRISTINA: how do you...?
COLLEGE STUDENT: hey, you dropped this.
DEREK: wow. thanks.
ANNOUNCER: newark station.

COLTER: everyone has a destiny. and this isn't yours. 
CHRISTINA: who in the world are you?
COLTER: just do it. stop being afraid. believe in yourself.
ANNOUNCER: all aboard. doors are closing.
CHRISTINA: leave me alone.

ANNOUNCER: this is a new york bound train. 
90.: intrigued, colter leaves the exit door area...

RUTLEDGE: they've searched the wreckage and found the wallet. it was under the wall panel. just as you said. 
COLTER: believe me, he's our guy. he tossed his own wallet back on the train. only reason he'd do that...
RUTLEDGE: ...is if he wanted us to think he died in the explosion. i know.
RUTLEDGE: we looked into his profile.

RUTLEDGE: derek frost is a commodities trader, with a wife, two children and a promotion one month old. he's an emergency preparedness volunteer on his office floor, for sake. 
COLTER: you saw that terrorist video -- they said it was one of us. one of our own.
RUTLEDGE: if he's really the one, you can find out the rest of his plan.
COLTER: how?
RUTLEDGE: by any means necessary. there is no geneva convention in the source code.
COLTER: torture him, you mean.
RUTLEDGE: find out the plan, before it happens here. and then i'll let you die.
RUTLEDGE: in the conductor's compartment there's a fully loaded 9 millimeter handgun locked in a safe. think you can remember the combination?

GUZMAN: excuse me. 
COLTER: assalam'alaikoom.

OPERATOR: what listing? 
COLTER: the new york times.
CHRISTINA: hello?
STEPHANIE: christina? it's stephanie. where are you right now?
CHRISTINA: going to work. why?
STEPHANIE: the strangest thing. the phone rang at my desk and some guy i don't know said the train you're on isn't safe and that you should get off at the next stop. then he hung up.
CHRISTINA: what?

ANNOUNCER: now approaching newark station. 
CHRISTINA: i don't understand.
STEPHANIE: maybe you should get off. are you okay?
CHRISTINA: i'm fine. everything's normal. is there something on the news? some kind of alert?
STEPHANIE: nothing that i've heard.

ANNOUNCER: newark station. 
STEPHANIE: i think you should get off.
CHRISTINA: i'll be late for work.
STEPHANIE: the with work, christina! you hate that job anyway.
CHRISTINA: it's probably a joke. a weirdo guy from somewhere.

STEPHANIE: did you get off...? 
CHRISTINA: no. i'll call you back.
ANNOUNCER: this is a new york bound train. next stop new york - penn station.

COLTER: derek frost. 
COLTER: you forget something?
DEREK: gosh. is that my wallet?

DEREK: what the hell, man? what the hell??? 
COLTER: you see this?
COLTER: now you can't blow it up.

DEREK: what is this? get away from me! 
COLTER: believe me, i'm very accurate with one of these things.
DEREK: 
COLTER: stay there, my man.
DEREK: don't hurt me.
COLTER: stop acting, for chrissakes.
DEREK: keep my wallet. take my watch. take anything you want.
GUZMAN: there. now you have two wallets.
COLTER: shut up!
DEREK: please. i have a family.
COLTER: what about those other passengers?

GUZMAN: just what is this about? 
COLTER: this man's a terrorist. he planted a bomb on the train.
DEREK: what?
COLTER: what's the next attack? who else are you going to kill today, huh?
DEREK: oh oh
COLTER: one more step,
GUZMAN: don't treat him like this. he's not an animal. neither are you.
DEREK: listen to him. for sake i'm not a terrorist...!
COLTER: all you want. you took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today.
DEREK: eighty million dollars? i swear to you...
COLTER: then what about the wallet, huh? why the did you twice try to leave your wallet on board?

COLTER: time's up! what is it?! what is the next attack! so help me, i'll put this bullet through your brain. 
DEREK: i don't know what you're talking about!
COLTER: i'm going to do it.
DEREK: i would never hurt anyone. i have a family. i guess you'll have to kill me.
GUZMAN: you see? you are a human being.
GUZMAN: this can be worked out. we can listen to each other.
DEREK: anything you want... please...
COLTER: hello.
CHRISTINA: who is this?
COLTER: christina?

COLTER: how can you be calling this number? 
CHRISTINA: my friend had it. from when you called her -- to try and get me off the train. who are you? what do you want?
COLTER: i was trying to warn you.
CHRISTINA: about what?
COLTER: i'm not sure that it matters now.
CHRISTINA: talk to me. i feel that something terrible's going to happen. do i need to get off the train? am i going to die?
COLTER: i'm right here, okay? don't be afraid.
CHRISTINA: why didn't i get off the train?
COLTER: what did you say?

DEREK: trust me, by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed... 
BACK TO SCENE: colter looks to derek. his stomach sinks.
COLTER: "by one o'clock, the bridge is going to be jammed."â that's what you said. you knew. you knew there was going to be an evacuation. you knew before it happened. all those people walking across the...
COLTER: they're going to bomb the bridges.

CHRISTINA: what are you talking about. who's going to -- 
COLTER: christina? just hang in there. you'll be okay.

RUTLEDGE: yes... we appreciate that... i just hope the information has come in time to clear the bridges... thank you, sir. 
RUTLEDGE: whether or not they can stop the bridge attack, we came up with the intelligence. and that virtually assures all of our futures. this is just the beginning, guys.
RUTLEDGE: you did a great job, goodwin. you operated our captain with skill and professionalism. what's that you have?
GOODWIN: the army investigated colter's helicopter crash in iraq. apparently he stayed behind to fly protective cover for a disabled convoy until he ran out of fuel.
RUTLEDGE: what's this, then? some kind of posthumous reprimand for reckless flying?
GOODWIN: no. it's the silver star.
RUTLEDGE: send it on to his father. it'll ease the pain of his son's death.
GOODWIN: i thought i might inform the captain of the citation.

RUTLEDGE: better not. we can't risk acquainting him with the citation in case the memory wipe isn't entirely clean. 
GOODWIN: the memory wipe?
TECHNICIAN: i thought we were going to let him die.
RUTLEDGE: i know, i know. but now the director of national intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program, and until we train up another candidate, we'll need to keep colter around to demonstrate it.
TECHNICIAN: oh.
RUTLEDGE: this thing is much bigger than any one of us. goodwin, please clear colter's memories and re-initialize source code.

GOODWIN: how are you feeling? are you comfortable? 
COLTER: just do it.
GOODWIN: come again?
COLTER: just do it. i knew they wouldn't let me die. at least you can make me forget all of this. i hope.
COLTER: what are you waiting for? you're just doing your job. i'd do the same thing if i was you. at least you've got a shot at saving those people on the bridges.
GOODWIN: i doubt it.
COLTER: you don't think they'll save them?

GOODWIN: no. i meant, i doubt you'd be doing this, if you were me. 
COLTER: look, someone had to be where you're sitting, and someone had to be in here. turned out it was you and me.
COLTER: just do it. i'm tired.
GOODWIN: would you like to see christina again? one last time?
COLTER: i don't understand.
GOODWIN: seventeen minutes. that's all i could give you. no mission to fulfill. just... the two of you.
COLTER: why would you do that?
GOODWIN: as a favor. one prisoner to another.
COLTER: prisoner?
GOODWIN: you were right. about me. and about source code. we've kept too much from each other.
GOODWIN: i usually report in at 0600. today i was there early. i was there when the call came in. your call.

COLTER: no... there's no way... there's no way you could have... 
COLTER: how? the source code was a parallel world! you told me so! it's hermetically sealed. nothing i did on that train would have any effect on this reality!
GOODWIN: you were on the train. i was not.
COLTER: but...
GOODWIN: we didn't know if any bleed- throughs could occur. the implications would be staggering. that's why you were told to avoid unduly influencing events.
COLTER: you're saying i could have saved those people?!
GOODWIN: no. not in our world. the time currents are too strong. but minor alterations, here and there, a phone call, say, those might slip through. we didn't know for sure. but you proved it. colter is thunderstruck. unable to grasp it.
GOODWIN: i've been thinking about the things you said on that call. as the day passed, the more i understood them. and now, i guess we've caught up to each other.
COLTER: man. just when i think i understand this...

GOODWIN: there's not much time. they think i'm re-initializing the system. one last look at her. that's all i can give you. if that. 
COLTER: they'll nail your for this.
GOODWIN: if i had any feelings, i'd worry about that. but, as you've maintained, i do not.
COLTER: roger that.

GOODWIN: this is beleaguered castle signing off. acknowledge final transmission. 
COLTER: final transmission acknowledged.
COLTER: thank you, goodwin.

RUTLEDGE: this is rutledge. 
RUTLEDGE: 

RUTLEDGE: what is this? who authorized this? 
TECHNICIAN: we don't know, sir. but source code is up and running again.
RUTLEDGE: where's goodwin?
TECHNICIAN: no idea, sir.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1. what is the nature of your emergency? 
RUTLEDGE: shut it down.
TECHNICIAN: sir?
RUTLEDGE: shut down the source code. right now.
RUTLEDGE: fine. i'll do it myself.
TECHNICIAN: i wouldn't do that.
RUTLEDGE: and why not?

TECHNICIAN: we've never interrupted source code in mid run. we'd have to literally pull the plug. it could damage the processors. 
RUTLEDGE: let it finish, then. no harm in that, i guess.
RUTLEDGE: all of you are in deep i promise you. as for goodwin, he'll never make it off this base.
TECHNICIAN: i don't think that's where he's headed.
RUTLEDGE: he wouldn't.

COLLEGE STUDENT: hey, you dropped this. 
DEREK: wow. thanks.

THROUGH THE OPEN DOORS: in station lobby are police officers.
