STRANG: finally. dotty g. and her forty-two- k a year are history. who else would do us that favor? 
ANDREWS: wish they'd all sail off like her.
STRANG: the "r" bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place.
HURLEY: "r-bomb"? oh my restructuring?
COX: separating the chaff from the wheat. chaff is the bad stuff, right?
HURLEY: chaff is the waste matter, correct.
COX: before e.o.q. them's our orders.
STRANG: what say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd?
ANDREWS: how?
STRANG: firing someone.
COX: someone they'd never expect to be let go. to look fair. i like it.
STRANG: like a team leader.
HURLEY: team leader?

COX: suggestions on who it should be? 
STRANG: i say crowne.
HURLEY: larry crowne?
STRANG: who else? avery won't retire. we fire him, it's a law suit.
STRANG: alvarez is about to drop a kid. she'll go part time in a week.

COX: what salary tier is crowne at?
ANDREWS: top of the pyramid with a c.o.l.
COX: sweet. we'll need actionable cause, of course.
COX: how's his review record?
HURLEY: he's a candidate for employee of the month. his 22nd time.
COX: okay. so. sluggers, gimme a reason...

HURLEY: we could use the limited horizons strategy. 
HURLEY: larry will always be passed over for management. he never went to college.
COX: you're that familiar with his record?
STRANG: she was his squeeze for a few weeks, weren't you, vick?
HURLEY: that was before the new employee covenants. that you even remember...
STRANG: the memory haunts me.
ANDREWS: he'll sock us for severance.
STRANG: big brick in the pond, though.
COX: let's call it. today, end of shift, unimart bids crowne adieu.

LARRY CROWNE: team leaders zone departments before punching out. it's policy. 
VASQUEZ: i mean here here. you just got paged to meeting room 2.
LARRY CROWNE: probably to clean up after the party.
VASQUEZ: isn't it employee of the month day?
LARRY CROWNE: speck-tack-alar.
VASQUEZ: you're the only one around here who deserves it. how many will this be?
LARRY CROWNE: ah, who's counting?

LARRY CROWNE: remember how we saw "the unimart way" video, vick? you and me, alone in this room, and look at us now. 
STRANG: cubby. make tracks.

LARRY CROWNE: i think i know what this is about. 
STRANG: i don't think you do.
COX: crowne. at unimart, we care. so we take care. which makes moments like these tough for all of us.
LARRY CROWNE: sounds like you're firing me.
STRANG: i take it back.
COX: corporate has mandated a restructuring in all unimart stores. that's the word they use.
COX: it is touchas, right? where you get kicked?
HURLEY: yeah. a yiddish word.
ANDREWS: like the buttocks.
HURLEY: touchas and buttocks. synonymous.
COX: hurts to get kicked back there, no matter what language you speak.
LARRY CROWNE: unimart is firing me...
STRANG: crowne-ie, you did a heck of a job.
LARRY CROWNE: why me?

ANDREWS: who do you suggest? alvarez? 
LARRY CROWNE: why not strang?
LARRY CROWNE: i've been here longer than you, jack. i started 21 years ago as an inventory associate at the store on euclid.
HURLEY: seniority would preclude this reality, larry, but unimart's policy is to never limit your horizons.
COX: here's the prob: your lack of a graduate degree will forever any move up the management ladder.
STRANG: becasue you never went to college you're forever retarded.
LARRY CROWNE: i won't make the front office?
STRANG: never. s. m. u. class of '86! go 'stangs!
LARRY CROWNE: i went in the navy. right outta high school. five years, and by then...

LARRY CROWNE: this is just sitting here? talia! this is unproductive capital! sell it on ebay.
TALIA: no one should ever buy clothes off the internet. you have to feel the fabric and test the drape...
LARRY CROWNE: what is all this worth?
TALIA: a lot to me. try these on.
LARRY CROWNE: where?
TALIA: anywhere. fashion is no place for modesty. strip.

TALIA: this is a service to humankind, lance. it hurts me to see a top cat dressed like an ex-hockey player. you gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar. starting now. 
DELL GORDO: monkey! thought you might be here.
TALIA: lance! my boyfriend's here! put your pants on! larry, in fact, has his pants off.
INT./EXT. - MERCEDES' CAR -- AFTERNOON: she is driving home.
GPS VOICE: please enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT: go to hell...

HE'S: candles. flowers. in other words, he's making up. mercedes comes in through the door. sees what's up. 
DEAN TAINOT: no argument here, mercy. fact: i'm a dope. fact: my wife is beautiful and brilliant. and i will be a good boy from now on. why? because you're right and i've learned my lesson. just don't be mad at me forever. i have a pliable soul and i pray you do too

DEAN TAINOT: ah. that was nice. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: it was. yes.
DEAN TAINOT: been thinking. if you ever want to take a whack at writing something -- say a blog a couple of times a week -- i could help you out.
MERCEDES TAINOT: how?
DEAN TAINOT: i'd read your stuff. make comments to make it web-savvy. pieces need to pop, you know. takes a little

MERCEDES TAINOT: okay. 
DEAN TAINOT: see? you can't stay mad at me. no reason to be mad at me...
DEAN TAINOT: i'm just a guy who's a guy being a guy...

DENISE: this is denise. how can i help you. 
LARRY CROWNE: denise. larry.
DENISE: my larry crowne. i remember you.
LARRY CROWNE: this a good time?
DENISE: other than me being at work?
LARRY CROWNE: i'll call you later.
DENISE: i'm surprised is all. what do you want?

LARRY CROWNE: well. okay. uh. here's the deal. 
DENISE: spit it, lar.
LARRY CROWNE: i'm going to miss a few months on the checks for the house.
DENISE: okay.
LARRY CROWNE: i hoped not to, but i there it is.
DENISE: okay. yeah.
LARRY CROWNE: i'm sorry.

DENISE: how many months? 
LARRY CROWNE: let's start with six.
DENISE: that can't happen, larry. i'm extended. i've put a deposit down on the first vacation i've had in 5 1/2 years. my expenses are as valid as yours, so i need the checks like always. a deal's a deal.

LARRY CROWNE: i don't have it. 
DENISE: that's not my problem. take out a loan on the house or something.
LARRY CROWNE: i tried. i'm too much of a risk.
DENISE: oh, i'm not touching that. i don't want to open up the whole lawyer thing, but i will if pushed. doesn't it? i appreciate the rigorous crowne honesty, but this can't happen.
DENISE: these calls are monitored to guarantee customer satisfaction, so i'm hanging up before my supervisor comes on...

PERRY: can i smell trouble or what? 
RAUL: can you speak english?
PERRY: those two over in booth 6...
PERRY: homeland security. i piped thei badges and everything.
RAUL: what is homeland security doing here...

RAUL: this is larry crowne? 
LARRY CROWNE: raul? yes.
RAUL: get your down here. you got a job.
LARRY CROWNE: i do?

PERRY: we're swamped, kimosabe. get back there! 
RAUL: you're late on your first day!

LARRY CROWNE: the uss coral sea. 
LARRY CROWNE: boss, i don't want to quit school.
RAUL: so don't.
LARRY CROWNE: i gotta get to class before i miss the whole day. and i can't work mornings mondays, wednesdays, fridays.
RAUL: soon as the rush is finished, go. i'll get my brother-in-law three days a week. you take evenings. deal?
LARRY CROWNE: deal. when will we talk salary?
RAUL: never. this is take it or leave it. don t worry. i may be tough but i'll be fair.

MACK: these are not toys. nobody 'plays' with these. these are kept behind glass, so no way am i passing them around today. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: wait a ding dong minute. 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9. someone is missing! who cut my class?
MERCEDES TAINOT: where's larry crowne?!

MACK: guess larry's out today. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: anyone know why?
MACK: he didn't call me.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i don't believe this! ditching me? he ditched me? not okay. larry crowne, you are on my list.
DIBIASI: sounds like teacher has a thing for a teach-ee.
CALIMERIS: when you were out last week, she said nothing. i think she has a crush on larry crowne.
PINEDO: i do too. he's a nice man.
MACK: should i continue?
MERCEDES TAINOT: yes. tell us more about your man dolls.
MACK: i'm sure everyone recognizes boba fett...

LARRY CROWNE: i'm sorry i'm late, dr. matsutani. 
DR. MATSUTANI: this is college, mr. crowne. the only thing you can't do is smoke in the building. hand over your phone.
DR. MATSUTANI: i'm going to ask a question in a moment. i want someone other than you to answer it - i don't care if the silence is positively arctic. larry moves to take a seat.
DR. MATSUTANI: this brings us to a dreaded task to every corporate entity. what is the purpose of semi-annual re- purposing? anyone?
DR. MATSUTANI: anyone?
LARRY CROWNE: lala... to upload market differences without...
PINEDO: without mooting the quarterlies. i know.
LARRY CROWNE: then say it.
LARRY CROWNE: just give the answer. you know it.
PINEDO: can i?

LARRY CROWNE I: insist. 
PINEDO: to up... met... es without ...ing ...terly predicts....?
DR. MATSUTANI: i know what you mean, but please share it with your classmates?
PINEDO: to upload market differences without mooting quarterly predictions.
DR. MATSUTANI: does this affect the value index?
PINEDO: no. only the profit markdown.
DR. MATSUTANI: someone is doing the reading!

MERCEDES TAINOT: is that larry crowne!? 
MERCEDES TAINOT: you have a lot of nerve showing your face on campus after ditching my class!
LARRY CROWNE: i'm sorry, ms. tainot. i will not miss another class, this i vow.

MERCEDES TAINOT: vows come cheap, larry crowne. you'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first. a story, with details, not a laundry list or slide show. and, as i told dibiasi, no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: or the most recent.
TALIA: that woman is one clenched fist of fury.

TALIA: she must not be having any amok lovin'. 
SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST: that makes me cranky, too.
TALIA: without a workout in the inner sanctum a few times a week i can't concentrate.
LARRY CROWNE: inappropriate subject in mixed company.
SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST: for girl-talk this is nothing.

TALIA: you you want to fix it with your teacher? bang her. 
LARRY CROWNE: she's marred.
TALIA: you'd kill two birds in one bush. nothing wrong with a campus romance. otherwise life is what? breakfast work, coffee, school, lunch, scoot, class, shop, talk, mexican food, a movie, glass of wine or two then bed? that's not living.
SCOOTER HAIR STYLIST: not without some smooching time.
TALIA: bet she'd give you an a plus.
TALIA: if you're any good...

LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: more complimentary coffee? 
LARRY CROWNE: complimentary coffee is usually lousy.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: i drink it all day.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: so? you're back!

LARRY CROWNE: i got a job. 
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: atta baby!
LARRY CROWNE: perry's coffee shop. breakfast all day. and i'm going to school.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: at east city. i see. larry, this doesn't change anything.
LARRY CROWNE: i was afraid of that.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: the interest alone will eat up your service industry salary.
LARRY CROWNE: you said come back in a few weeks.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: okay.
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: i will personally take this to my supervisor and fight to get you the loan you need. but you know how complimentary coffee is always lousy? your chances are, too.
LARRY CROWNE: i can't make the payments on the house. i'm going to lose it, aren't i?
LAURIE GAMMELGAARD: stop with the gloomy puss. you're doing everything right. hang in there. you still have a friend at riverbank.
LARRY CROWNE: you guys are forced to say that, aren't you?

DELL GORDO: i think it's letting up. 
TALIA: it's going to storm till next year.
DELL GORDO: we can't stay here all day. find a raincoat and let's get a little wet.
TALIA: i do not scoot in the rain.
DELL GORDO: how you going to get to school then, college co-ed belle?
TALIA: my savior! look at your new schmatas.
TALIA: and footwear! stay dry, sweetie!
MERCEDES TAINOT: i got engaged to a teacher/writer with two books in print...

FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH: i never read them. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: who did? i'm married to an ex- teacher turned blogger with two books in print. and oh, yes, he has the libido and internet access of a 13-year-old.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH: i had a boyfriend who owned every movie sophia loren ever made. i d hear a dvd go into the playe an knew what i was going to be doing in a half-hour.
MERCEDES TAINOT: once more to divorce court to cashier a spouse, line my cloak with alimony and do myself homage.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH: othello. act 1. scene 1. iago to roderigo.
MERCEDES TAINOT: why can't all my students be like y u?
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH: because, as i learned in your class, i am one of a kind.
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH: hey, that guy's in your class.

MERCEDES TAINOT: and that toy poodle he keeps on a leash! 
MERCEDES TAINOT: that's why he's in college! to get laid!
FRANCES TAYLOR-BRIEGH: it happens.
MERCEDES TAINOT: you are everything that's wrong with america, larry crowne!

DIBIASI: woah! larry crowne, i didn't know you were gay. you've gone all project runway on us. 
LARRY CROWNE: should i begin?
LARRY CROWNE: first crossing of the equator...

MERCEDES TAINOT: talking to herself in the movie 
DEVICE WAY): oh shut up you sleaze. jerk.
DEVICE WAY): look at the new pants. they actually fit. and that jacket is 'smart'. did busik put larry crowne into fashion for creeps? an old goat dressed like lamb.
DEVICE WAY): of course! it's that doe-eyed young thing he's been wearing on his sleeve. dressing like he's half his age. give me a shotgun!
DEVICE WAY): am i being unfair? i mean, if i were single and some young buck took to me, wouldn't i be inclined to diddly-dally?
MERCEDES TAINOT: youth wouldn't be the only requirement, of course.
DIBIASI: what? what he say?
LARRY CROWNE: unless you're looking at a chart, you don't even know the equator when you cross it...
MERCEDES TAINOT: a repackaged larry crowne won't fool me. shame on you. going after jail bait, you criminal.
MERCEDES TAINOT: herself at you... no. don't let up. no, mercy. no mercy!

MERCEDES TAINOT: anyone recall anything from that? 
PINEDO: that larry believed there were signs on posts marking the equator.
CALIMERIS: and that, when it's a first time, they make the rookies dress in drag and sing abba songs?
MACK: larry worked on an aircraft carrier! night carrier landings are the trickiest flying in world.
MERCEDES TAINOT: that was a memorable nugget.
PINEDO: larry was stationed in panama! my father is from panama!
MERCEDES TAINOT: mr. koss to the lectern, please.

TALIA: woman on deck! 
RAUL: you can't come in here.
TALIA: i'm a friend of lance's.
RAUL: no lance works for me.
RAUL: this is my kitchen and i am the boss.
TALIA: is he, lance?
LARRY CROWNE: raul's my boss, yeah.
TALIA: rah-ool. rhymes with ya-cool. are ya' cool, raul?
RAUL: sure i'm cool. tough but fair, too.
TALIA: as boss, do you make up the menu?

PERRY: breakfast all day, see. from corn flakes to popovers. we make the best chicken fried steak outside of a truck stop. 
TALIA: can lance take a break?
PERRY: who?
TALIA: the artist formerly known as larry. i need his expertise.
PERRY: lance.

LARRY CROWNE: square footage at this price is a bargain. 
TALIA: maurice says i'm saving his life by renting the space.
LARRY CROWNE: this is your matsutani delta number. you net this every month, you cover overhead, and the rest is profit.
TALIA: you sure?
LARRY CROWNE: chapter four.

TALIA: you make it sound so simple!! 
LARRY CROWNE: well, back to work!

DEAN TAINOT: work my off all night trying to get i in' smile out of you! 
MERCEDES TAINOT: i'm smiling...
DEAN TAINOT: like the joker after three apple martinis.
MERCEDES TAINOT: if they help, they help.
DEAN TAINOT: we can't even have a date night now? you can't even chillax for one meal?
MERCEDES TAINOT: "chillax?" did you use the word "chillax?" that come from your bloggers thesaurus?

GPS VOICE: please enter your destination. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: you lie to me, dean. every day.
DEAN TAINOT: you looking for a whole new man, mercy? i'm the jerk who has to transform into ultraman to make you happy? no. i like myself, mercy. i put up with you and complain about nothing.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i'm not complaining. i'm stating the truth. i teach while you pretend to work.
DEAN TAINOT: i had three postings today alone. fogcaster, skyscan, and parsectwelve.com
MERCEDES TAINOT: those weren't postings. they were comments.
DEAN TAINOT: hey, booze-illa, who are you to judge me?
DEAN TAINOT: i know what's really you off. i like big titties. and you don't have any.
DEAN TAINOT: maybe i should take that back.

JANET: as soon as i saw you, i said, "i want to go out with that man." 
TONY: what did you say when i asked you out?
JANET: i said "yes." you were there, remember?
TONY: i saw you and i thought "i would be a lucky guy if she'd go out with me."
JANET: yes you are.
TONY: honestly, this is about as good a first date goes, isn't it?
JANET: disaster looms on most first dates, but i'm talking to you like you're a friend i want to make out with.
TONY: hold that thought.
DEAN TAINOT: i take it back. i take it back.
MERCEDES TAINOT: drive, asshole! drive away!
DEAN TAINOT: i've been drinking, too.
MERCEDES TAINOT: drive straight til you hit a cliff on the coastline!
DEAN TAINOT: you win! i'm letting you win!

MERCEDES TAINOT: loser! i married a loser!!! with a tiny tiny loser! 
DEAN TAINOT: screw you, you washboard!
MERCEDES TAINOT: oh, chillax!!!
GPS VOICE: please enter your destination.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i'm throwing rocks at my own car !!
MERCEDES TAINOT: the jerk who just deserted me? my husband of 4 friggin' years!

TALIA: lance! chick alert! 
TALIA: you are not going to believe how fate meets cute! she u-turns and larry follows her, confused.

LARRY CROWNE: ms. tainot? 
MERCEDES TAINOT: no.
LARRY CROWNE: larry crowne.
MERCEDES TAINOT: christ.
TALIA: and i've been calling you 'lance'.
LARRY CROWNE: do you need a ride? hop on.
MERCEDES TAINOT: and bust up your romp in the glen with bambi?
TALIA: hey. bambi was a boy.
LARRY CROWNE: i was heading home.
LARRY CROWNE: right? we're done scooting?
TALIA: not me. i love riding in the night. magic happens.

79.: away talia scoots to catch up with the gang. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: what do men see in irritating free spirits?
LARRY CROWNE: seriously. i offer you a ride.
MERCEDES TAINOT: seriously. i don't want one.
LARRY CROWNE: i've yet to give anyone a lift on this but i think i can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i am walking, crowne, as thoughts black boil up from my soul. major consequences sure to follow. you'll read about them on parsectwelve.com.
LARRY CROWNE: an attractive woman like you walking alone is a idea.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i need a man flirting with me right now like i need a dog crapping on my lawn. i'm hoofing it.
LARRY CROWNE: in those shoes?
MERCEDES TAINOT: a man who notices shoes.
MERCEDES TAINOT: all right. i'll be your cycle slut.
LARRY CROWNE: put this on.
LARRY CROWNE: strap your legs round my engine and

MERCEDES TAINOT: it won't be a terrible thing if you kill us both. 
LARRY CROWNE: ain't you a ball of fun?

MERCEDES TAINOT: are you really going to go this slow? 
LARRY CROWNE: i do want to survive this night.
MERCEDES TAINOT: fine. i have time to window shop. oh look, a sale on tires at autousa. and here comes a mailbox. i've never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme. this is so slow a cat could knock us over.

LARRY CROWNE: where am i taking you? 
MERCEDES TAINOT: down to portola and left to havenhurst. havenhurst to palermo.
LARRY CROWNE: i may use this as a presentation in class.
MERCEDES TAINOT: try it and you'll flunk.

MERCEDES TAINOT: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
LARRY CROWNE: i like your class. you're making us all do things we never thought we could.
MERCEDES TAINOT: put the shovel away and just get me home, 'kay?
MERCEDES TAINOT: hail our city's finest.
LARRY CROWNE: someone's getting pinched...
MERCEDES TAINOT: measure his dick, officer! he's too diminutive to drive!
MERCEDES TAINOT: tiny loser!
LARRY CROWNE: bad night for that guy.
MERCEDES TAINOT: best night i've had in years!

LARRY CROWNE: unit 114. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: thanks for the ox-cart ride. like a sleepwalker. stands at the alarm pad.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i can see the alarm pad. i know the code. but my hands aren't working.
MERCEDES TAINOT: help me.
LARRY CROWNE: you don't want to give me your pass code.
MERCEDES TAINOT: just hold my hand up to the numbers. i'll manage from there.
MERCEDES TAINOT: look away now.
MERCEDES TAINOT: two two two two. pound.
MERCEDES TAINOT: w ere's my purse? oh yeah. my car. the key please? it's buried in that plant.
LARRY CROWNE: this it?
MERCEDES TAINOT: why i think it is!
LARRY CROWNE: i'll get the door for you

MERCEDES TAINOT: take one step inside and i call security. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: and forget this ever happened.
LARRY CROWNE: what?
MERCEDES TAINOT: this whole sorry chapter tonight.
LARRY CROWNE: what?
MERCEDES TAINOT: you passing up gidget for a flat old coot like me.
LARRY CROWNE: what are you talking about?
MERCEDES TAINOT: what, you have no short-term memory?
LARRY CROWNE: when i say 'what', it means i get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything. call it irony.
MERCEDES TAINOT: sarcasm. irony is when gallant lands in the drunk tank while goofus scoots me home.
LARRY CROWNE: goodnight, ms. tainot.
MERCEDES TAINOT: mrs. i'm mrs. tainot. can you not see that?
LARRY CROWNE: i assumed you preferred ms

MERCEDES TAINOT: when we presume we make a pretty pair of of me and you or something like that. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: why aren't you married?
LARRY CROWNE: that's a long story and it's late.
LARRY CROWNE: my helmet?
MERCEDES TAINOT: help yourself.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i noticed something on the ride.

IT MAY: you smell good. 
LARRY CROWNE: thanks.
MERCEDES TAINOT: do you have a crush on me? single student. unattainable teacher. it's common.
LARRY CROWNE: we all have crushes on you. even the gals.
MERCEDES TAINOT: you want to make out with me, you can. i know i'm not a third rate audrey hepburn wanna-be but i still
GOT MOVES: come on, gramps. take this ride.

MERCEDES TAINOT: my spouse won't be home for 3 to 5 years. 
LARRY CROWNE: wow...
MERCEDES TAINOT: pretty dang good. i still got it, no?
LARRY CROWNE: yes, you do..
LARRY CROWNE: in you go. close the door.
LARRY CROWNE: lock it!

LARRY CROWNE: goodnight, whoever you are! 
MERCEDES TAINOT: whoever i am...

DEAN TAINOT: oh, and tomorrow... 
DEAN TAINOT: mercy!!!

TALIA AND LARRY: amid the others... 
TALIA: oh, come on! i left you all set up! what went down?
LARRY CROWNE: epilog. school today.
TALIA: lance! a betty on your scooter after midnight? holding on, her arms around you, pressed against your back, is a license to at least cop a feel.
LARRY CROWNE: if we had ended up making out, you still wouldn't hear it.

PINEDO: seeing them -- the northern lights, the aurora borealis -- should have been beyond me, but i was a little girl in coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me. 
PINEDO: that is something i will remember forever.
MERCEDES TAINOT: mr. crowne? a moment please?
CALIMERIS: why doesn't she just throw herself at him?
PINEDO: this is bordering on harassment now.
DIBIASI: quiet down. i'm watching the tv show...
MACK: why doesn't this ever happen to me?

MERCEDES TAINOT: i need a few moments alone with mr. 
DIBIASI: move along folks. privacy's a right in this great nation of ours.
MACK: you want i should close this door, lock it, and barricade it so you won't be disturbed??
LARRY CROWNE: how are the triplets? groggy, puffy, and grumpy.
MERCEDES TAINOT: last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short a time span.
LARRY CROWNE: last i ht? let's see, what was i doing? studying some. working some. can't recall. i've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i had no right to judge you or your relationships. date who you want.
MERCEDES TAINOT: but what happened last night -- between adults -- was inappropriate. if gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. my status as a professor could be tarnished.
LARRY CROWNE: i wouldn't want that.
MERCEDES TAINOT: happened before.

MERCEDES TAINOT: with parking attendants. strangers at parties when i've had a bit too much of the demon rum. this was the first time with a student. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: i hope the entire thing will be forgotten.
LARRY CROWNE: sure. nothing happened. at all.
MERCEDES TAINOT: so there will be no bravado among you and your pals?
LARRY CROWNE: none.
MERCEDES TAINOT: thank you, mr. crowne.
LARRY CROWNE: i'd better scurry along to dr. matsutani's class. i hope i don't have this same conversation with him. larry leaves - a good mood ruined...

LAMARR: puff. don't suck. then... relax. 
LAMARR: see? works.
LARRY CROWNE: i have to sell my car.

LARRY CROWNE: if i could afford a new top i could afford to keep it. 
LAMARR: what's the job paying you?
LARRY CROWNE: half my unimart salary.
LAMARR: you're down, larry crowne. down as dirt.
LARRY CROWNE: i'm looking back on the year denise left as the good old days.
LAMARR: hang in there, neighbor.
LARRY CROWNE: everyone keeps saying that.
LAMARR: i was in the same spot. look what happened.
LARRY CROWNE: the odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery.
LAMARR: i read how the universe is expanding, larry, taking us along with it. that is a wild concept to grasp, but what it means is, we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we're going to be.
LARRY CROWNE: this thing must be making me dizzy.
LAMARR: keep your grip. you'll be okay. it's like the wife always says...

HURLEY: ' ind bargains today?' 
LARRY CROWNE: vick? how you doing? larry crowne.
HURLEY: larry. hi.
LARRY CROWNE: why are you on the register?

HURLEY: management execs are now required to put in 8-hour shifts on the floor. every day. no overtime. no bonus. just more hours. cash or unimart bargain card? like you have one of them. 
LARRY CROWNE: cash. no receipt.
HURLEY: you got out of here just in time... 'thank you for choosing unimart, where united we blah blah.'

DEAN TAINOT: hi. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: thanks for coming.
DEAN TAINOT: no notice. no preamble. just an email and a google map.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i knew you'd be on the computer.
MERCEDES TAINOT: working...
DEAN TAINOT: point made.
DEAN TAINOT: so. what up.
MERCEDES TAINOT: are we making a mistake here?

MERCEDES TAINOT: point made. we could change things. we could start right now. 
DEAN TAINOT: we could. why should we?
MERCEDES TAINOT: because we have history, dean. but first, my thoughts... i've got to address drinking. i should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations. and the morning shower should be refreshing, not a hangover cure.
DEAN TAINOT: i'd like that too.
MERCEDES TAINOT: really?
DEAN TAINOT: you're not a pleasant woman after a few glasses. mornings with you are to be survived.
MERCEDES TAINOT: okay. now, you.
DEAN TAINOT: i see. i'm what this is all about.
MERCEDES TAINOT: there are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but let's start here.
DEAN TAINOT: you're talking about you but you really mean me.
DEAN TAINOT: i am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything. so you don't get to either.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i'm not saying that.

DEAN TAINOT: we've both been here before. why prolong the process? white flag! i give up. this ain't working. 
DEAN TAINOT: i'll sign papers and checks, see if there's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually i will be fine and you will too. but i am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults.
DEAN TAINOT: i just now came up with that, and it is going to be my next posting.
DEAN TAINOT: i don't think there is anything else to talk about. do you?

MERCEDES TAINOT: here i have surprise topics. friday, in a lightning round, you must wax on that topic for 2 minutes without pause, repetition, or lack of charm. no notes. one visual aid. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: ms pinedo draw
96.: ms. pinedo pulls a paper from the box.
MS. PINEDO: 'potatoes?'
MERCEDES TAINOT: spuds. can't wait.
DIBIASI: 'disraeli'? what is that?
MERCEDES TAINOT: who is that?
DIBIASI: it's a guy from disrael. i'm done.
LARRY CROWNE: 'consumerism'.
MERCEDES TAINOT: that's supposed to say 'communism.'
LARRY CROWNE: the handwriting is loopy. looks like 'consumerism'.
MERCEDES TAINOT: fine. 2 minutes on consumerism.
CALIMERIS: 'malpity hoople.'
CALIMERIS: what's this say?
MERCEDES TAINOT: no idea. just pick another.

DR. MATSUTANI: at the end of each chapter is a study guide. master those and you will have mastered my book. master my book and you will take over the world. 
DR. MATSUTANI: by now you should be laughing with me.

TALIA: you digging what you see? 
LARRY CROWNE: you missed matsutani's class.
TALIA: i'm done w th college.

MERCEDES TAINOT: i was tough on him. but he learned fast. how he connected the circle of sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell. i'll never forget about the value index now. 
MERCEDES TAINOT: and... he's polite. instead of fighting me off that night, what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in. what kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me? he could have ravaged me. i misread this guy and if i had a brain i'd find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself. i wonder if he'd like that, if he would... what did i just say?
MERCEDES TAINOT: what did i just say about larry crowne?
DIBIASI: nothing. and i was just wrapping up here.
MERCEDES TAINOT: i'm so sorry. please go on.
DIBIASI: larry? it okay if i get to my climax and denouement?
DIBIASI: thank you... if it was the romance novelist in him that made victoria the queen become such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of ben disraeli -- earl of beaconsfield - educator - and prime minister of great britain. not bad for a jewish guy, huh?

PINEDO: not so much as a bump, nomad! 
DIBIASI: fourth quarter dramatics.
