OFFICER: benny, take it easy... 
BENNY: i don't want to scare them away.

SECOND OFFICER: smells smoke... 
BENNY: i told you.

BENNY: there!! up on the hill!! 
BENNY: right in line with that burning tree.
OFFICER: i don't see anything.
BENNY: it's there. the fog's thicker now, but it's there. what do you think started those fires?
OFFICER: benny, there's nothing there.
BENNY: there is. they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
OFFICER: flew?! oh, come on benny...
OFFICER: you hear that, mike? now he's telling us...
MIKE: what's that?
BENNY: what did i tell you?
OFFICER: probably kids.
MIKE: probably...

BENNY: don't you think you should call a backup? 
OFFICER: no, we can handle this.

OFFICER: this is the police. identify yourselves. it is deathly silent. 
BENNY: there's one over here...
BENNY: stop!! police!!
MIKE: what happened?

PARTNER: what the was it anyway? 
DRIVER: if i know.

PARTNER: come on. i'm getting wet. 
DRIVER: it musta been a bird.
PARTNER: how about if i drive now?

MAN: major aaron bell... 
SHERMIN: marc shermin, national security agency.
SHERMIN: this has always been my favorite time of day.
MAJOR BELL: very beautiful country up here...
SHERMIN: any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
MAJOR BELL: not on the landscape. we're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
SHERMIN: can you see under the faceplate?
MAJOR BELL: no.
SHERMIN: there's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
MAJOR BELL: wait'll you see it.
MAJOR BELL: we had a flight of f16's play tag with the spaceship over michigan for an hour. then it shot straight up and disappeared.
SHERMIN: was there visual contact?
MAJOR BELL: no, sir. radar.
SHERMIN: it could have been anything.

MAJOR BELL: after i called in, i had a chance to sit down with the three locals. they swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... it might be alive. 
SHERMIN: people have made mistakes in these situations before.
MAJOR BELL: i've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, mr. shermin. this one's real. we have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. we've been visited. it's finally happened and the sooner washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.

MAJOR BELL: look at the hands. 
SHERMIN: oh,
SUBTITLE: mapmaker wind. do you hear me?
SHERMIN: the other one is alive!

STAR MAN: mapmaker wind. do you hear me? 
STAR MAN: mapmaker wind. do you hear me?

LYMAN: is it for real? 
SHERMIN: get fox.
SHERMIN: it's real, george.
FOX: there's no mistake? you're absolutely sure?
SHERMIN: i saw it with my own eyes. we've killed an extraterrestrial and...
FOX: is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?
SHERMIN: none. and there's another one in the area that's alive. i don't know if it's the only one. i don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
FOX: get the body out of there. load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson. they'll take it from there... we didn't expect this, shermin.
SHERMIN: neither did i.
FOX: we're going... we'll tell the press that there was an accident. chemical warfare spill. that cover cannot be violated in any way. understand me, shermin?
MAJOR BELL: major bell here, sir. we have to tell these people that we're friendly. that this whole thing was a mistake. is anyone trying to contact the ship?
FOX: shermin, i want you and bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
SHERMIN: we'll need a lot of help, george. you could hide an army up here.
FOX: i'm going to the white house right now. i'll try and get you everything you need.
SHERMIN: wait, wait... what are my orders if we find this thing?
FOX: contain it and get back to me.
SHERMIN: what do you mean by 'contain?'
FOX: just what i said.

JENNY: i hope so... we'll see... see you tomorrow... bye. bye. 
VOICE: remember you're required to have a lesson planned tomorrow.

SHERMIN: aghh... i'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow. 
LYMAN: i wouldn't worry about it... there might not be any little league tomorrow.
MAJOR BELL: i'm telling you they're probably friendly.
LYMAN: then why did they try and sneak in the back door? tell me that. why didn't they contact us first and say...
RADAR TECHNICIAN: ufo coming out of the grass.
SHERMIN: lock in.
RADAR TECHNICIAN: got it.
LYMAN: this is crazy. what were we going to do if that had been the ship? we have two thirty calibre machine guns, three m16's and some handguns.
SHERMIN: give it a rest, lyman.
LYMAN: that's because the ones that were hurt, died. they couldn't talk to you.
SHERMIN: any reports about monsters, people in halloween masks, anything like that?
TECHNICIAN: no, but there sure were a lot of people who saw lights in the sky last night. reports are still coming in.
MAJOR BELL: i've heard of blood being drawn, sometimes they were taken for a ride in the ship, a lot of times they said they had sex... but nobody was ever hurt...
LYMAN: but you decided those weren't real. this one is.
LYMAN: fox.
FOX: i've got something for you.
FOX: recognize this?
MAJOR BELL: it's a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes.
FOX: houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
MAJOR BELL: they must have picked it up in space.
SHERMIN: then it's not an accident that they found us.
FOX: we don't think that's necessarily bad. at least it's a point of contact.
SHERMIN: not necessarily bad! if they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
FOX: we'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
SHERMIN: that's not going to happen, george, unless you get us the help you promised us.
FOX: we've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
SHERMIN: don't let them do it this way, george. it's too important. we can't find this thing alone.
FOX: you have to. we're trying to contact the ship. if we do, i'll let you know immediately. good luck.
RADAR TECHNICIAN: you get the feeling we're expendable?
SHERMIN: we always were.

STAR MAN: wehave... wehave... wehave... 
JENNY: 

STAR MAN: wehave... 
STAR MAN: wehave...
JENNY: please don't hurt me... please... please.

DR. BERGEN: the creature was hit three times... 
DR. BERGEN: ...the arm, the abdomen and the upper chest, the one in the chest being the cause of death. it shattered, for want of a better term, the creature's backbone. it's not really, because it's not jointed. it's simply a hollow shaft of very pliable silicate material, as is its entire endoskeleton. the creature seems to have tremendous regenerative powers. although it must have died within minutes of receiving the fatal wound, the arm and abdomen wounds are almost totally healed and the bullet here... has begun to dissolve...

DR. BERGEN: the flesh is gelatinous, the skin is very porous and very moist. this is another guess, but it probably comes from a planet that receives only reflected light, perhaps from a ring of moons. its atmospheric pressure is slightly less than ours and it contains a great deal more water... 
FOX: dr. bergen, george fox here in washington. can you give us an idea of why they're here?
DR. BERGEN: they're so advanced... i... eh... can't imagine what they would want from us. i know they could be dangerous. but they could also be the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind...

STAR MAN: please... 
JENNY: don't... don't do this... please...
JENNY: you're hurting me. stop.
JENNY: oh, no! i'm not leaving this house with you. you're going to hurt me, i know...
STAR MAN: please.
JENNY: why are you doing this to me? i'll give you whatever...

STAR MAN: please... 
JENNY: which way do you want to go?
JENNY: you can go that way... that way... that way...
STAR MAN: that way.
JENNY: what are you?
JENNY: i'm sorry...
JENNY: that green dot, that's us, isn't it... and the red's where you want to go?... you don't understand me, do you?
JENNY: i gotta get out of here.

JENNY: what? 
STAR MAN: what.
JENNY: ah... no...
STAR MAN: ah no.
JENNY: steering wheel...

JENNY: he's kidnapping me!!!
MAN: you crazy people...
JENNY: call the police!!
MAN: hey buddy... let her go...
JENNY: help me!!!
MAN: hey, she doesn't want to go with you. come on.
MAN: oh man... don't shoot me... my mistake... i'm sorry...
JENNY: he doesn't understand... just walk away...
MAN: i promise i'm not going to tell anybody about this... none of my business... i'm going to move now, okay... you guys want to fight, that's up to you... i'm leaving now... i won't say a word...
STAR MAN: go.

JENNY: could you put the gun down? 
JENNY: gun... down... down.
JENNY: thank you.

SHERMIN: there's nothing... no reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... seems like a totally isolated incident. 
MAJOR BELL: it was only an accident that we discovered them.
SHERMIN: i know, but...
SHERMIN: you married, major?
MAJOR BELL: twenty-eight years.
SHERMIN: to the same woman?
MAJOR BELL: yes.
SHERMIN: i tried it once... fourteen years ago... 'i was a lousy husband and a worse father. the only thing i'm good at is this... at least until yesterday.
SHERMIN: how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
MAJOR BELL: it was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
SHERMIN: listen to this. a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning. when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
MAJOR BELL: it was a man though... right?
SHERMIN: the police think he was high on drugs...
SHERMIN: what do you think?

MAJOR BELL: nothing up there... the grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything. 
SHERMIN: it was the husband. the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
MAJOR BELL: it's the right area, that's for sure.
SHERMIN: why the clicking language though?

SHERMIN: sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's been some trouble next door. i'd like to ask you a few questions. 
MAN: what happened?
SHERMIN: there's a possibility that mrs. haydn's been kidnapped. we're hoping you might have seen something.
WOMAN: i told you...
MAN: judy, that's stupid.
WOMAN: well, maybe these men won't think so. we were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. it made me so nervous i went into the kitchen for something to eat. i happened to look out the window and there was scott haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling jenny down the walk to the car.
MAN: you know that's impossible!
WOMAN: i know what i saw. i've seen him enough times.
MAN: scott haydn is dead. he died about three months ago. we went to the funeral.

STAR MAN: t-t-u... 
STAR MAN: u-v-v...
STAR MAN: cow... dog... pig...
STAR MAN: w-w...
STAR MAN: what?

SHERMIN: george, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial. 
FOX: when can we expect containment?
SHERMIN: well, we're in pursuit of a green mustang...
FOX: it's in a green mustang?
SHERMIN: yes. it's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
MILITARY MAN: this one has a weapon.
SHERMIN: no, no... a .45, it probably got it in the woman's house. they were last seen in downtown eau claire...
FOX: why did you let it get into a populated area?
SHERMIN: it's taken on a disguise.
FOX: clarify that.
SHERMIN: it's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
FOX: repeat the last item.
SHERMIN: the extraterrestrial now looks like this.
FOX: oh shit!!!
STAR MAN: the united states of america. in we trust. ten dollars.
JENNY: money.
STAR MAN: money.
JENNY: money.
STAR MAN: mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... jennyhaydn... money?

STAR MAN: space?

STAR MAN: no gas.
JENNY: i know.
STAR MAN: who?
JENNY: my... husband.
STAR MAN: i am husband?
JENNY: no. i don't know what you are, but you're not scott.

JENNY: go back to the car. 
JENNY: see. it's a bathroom. i'm not trying to escape. i just have to go to the bathroom.
JENNY: satisfied? now get out. out.

RIDER: do i need a key for the head?
ATTENDANT: it's open.
RIDER: fill it up.
ATTENDANT: you got it.

RIDER: howdy... can't get her out. 
STAR MAN: gas.
RIDER: i know how she feels.

STAR MAN: kid-nap-ped... go-ing w o-n... jenny realizes he doesn't know what it means. 
JENNY: that's very good.

JENNY: you want to try it? 
STAR MAN: i want to try it.
JENNY: this stuff could kill... be my guest.
STAR MAN: good.
JENNY: eh... you keep it. i've had enough.
JENNY: what's the matter?
STAR MAN: 

STAR MAN: what is kidnapped? 
STAR MAN: kidnapped!!!
STAR MAN: kidnapped!!! what is kidnapped?!!
JENNY: kidnapped is what you're doing to me now!!! kidnapped is pointing a gun at me and taking me from my house! kidnapped is changing yourself into my husband. i don't know what you are and i don't care. i just want to get away from you!
STAR MAN: jennyhaydn.
STAR MAN: i am good.
STAR MAN: what is that?
JENNY: horses.
STAR MAN: horses.

STAR MAN: what? 
JENNY: music.
JENNY: what are you doing?!
STAR MAN: iron channel message. transmute was successful. have captured one of them. it is taking me to the pick-up point in a land vehicle. i think i can control it by mastering its language, which is primitive and easy to learn. will arrive on time. wait for me. the star man opens his hands and, to jenny's astonishment, the ball rises quickly and seeps through her roof without leaving a trace.

FOX: i just came from a meeting with the security council and in view of the extraterrestrial's radical change and the fact that all our efforts to contact its ship remain unanswered, it was decided to issue a ten state 'all points bulletin' for scott haydn, jenny haydn and the green mustang. the officers have been instructed not to approach the people or the vehicle but to contact you. you will then move in and contain the subjects. 
SHERMIN: you sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
FOX: i'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
SHERMIN: i don't like it, george...
FOX: dammit shermin. earlier you were asking for help. what's changed?
SHERMIN: it's messy... the thing's got a gun... we're just asking for somebody to get killed...
FOX: we don't know what else to do. we need results.
SHERMIN: you'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... okay.
FOX: i'm gonna be here if you need anything.
MAJOR BELL: they're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
LYMAN: save us all a lot of trouble.
MAJOR BELL: lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
LYMAN: 
MAJOR BELL: you have no conception of this, do you?
LYMAN: you jerk! you look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. you know what's gonna come out of this... the end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. we could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. don't you see that? are you too stupid to see that?
SHERMIN: are you ladies through?...
SHERMIN: good... it looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so i think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
LYMAN: bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
SHERMIN: did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
MAJOR BELL: no... i guess we never thought it would happen.
SHERMIN: terrific.

JENNY: red light! 
JENNY: stop!!!

JENNY: that was a red light!! i told you you have to stop at a red light!! 
STAR MAN: it was yellow.
JENNY: you didn't even see it.
STAR MAN: i will see it next time.
JENNY: you better.

JENNY: why are you going here? what is here? 
STAR MAN: my... ...car will take me... ...up there... home.
JENNY: when do you have to be here?
STAR MAN: i do not understand.
JENNY: how will i do this one?...
JENNY: sun...
STAR MAN: yes.
JENNY: sun... day. no sun... night. you understand?
STAR MAN: yes. day... night.
JENNY: how many days and nights do you have to go... ...here?
STAR MAN: three nights... two days.
JENNY: that's not much time. i'll just slow you down. i have to sleep. i'm very tired. and i have to wash and eat. you don't...
STAR MAN: i need you.
JENNY: i won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. i promise. you'll keep...
STAR MAN: no.
JENNY: you'll keep the car. i'll take a bus... am i going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
STAR MAN: no.
JENNY: then let me go. you don't need me.
STAR MAN: no.
JENNY: i feel like i'm going crazy here. you're scott. but he's dead. i don't know what's real anymore. i can't be here with you.
JENNY: do you understand what i'm saying to you? you can keep the car. that should be enough for gas from here to there. please let me go.
STAR MAN: when we get here. jenny slams herself angrily back in the seat.
JENNY: you bastard.
STAR MAN: jennyhaydn!

MOTHER: my baby!!! he's stealing my baby! burt!! the star man holds the baby out to her. 
MOTHER: burt!! somebody stop him!! he was stealing my baby!!
MAN: where you think you're going?
STAR MAN: please.
MOTHER: he was trying to steal gloria.
BURT: is that right? huh?
STAR MAN: please.
BURT: is that right? come on. answer me.
BURT: were you trying to steal my baby? huh? answer me!
STAR MAN: jennyhaydn!

JENNY: stop it!!! stop it!!! 
JENNY: get away from him!! leave him alone!! you stupid jerks!! he's retarded!! can't you see that?!! get away from him!!
MOTHER: he was stealing my baby...
JENNY: you're wrong!! he would never do anything like that!! let's go...
MOTHER: he had gloria in his hands!
JENNY: he's retarded! i shouldn't have left him alone!
JENNY: get out of my way.

JENNY: are you okay? 
STAR MAN: thank you.

CLERK: gate three. it's boarding now. 
JENNY: thank you.
CLERK: have a nice trip.
JENNY: the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells...
STAR MAN: is that a baby?
JENNY: yes.
STAR MAN: a baby is a new person?
JENNY: eh... yes...
STAR MAN: do you have a baby?
JENNY: no... the closest...
STAR MAN: why?
JENNY: i'd love to have a baby. but i can't...
STAR MAN: why?
JENNY: i can't... forget the baby. okay? the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells. you'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
STAR MAN: but i must go here.
JENNY: i know that. but the buses don't go there.
STAR MAN: what is hitchhike?
JENNY: that's easy. i'll explain that in a minute. this is your ticket. when you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. you will ride to omaha. when you get to omaha, ask the driver. 'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.' the star man nods that he understands.
JENNY: say it.
STAR MAN: 'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'
JENNY: the driver will...
STAR MAN: but i speak english.
JENNY: will you please do it my way? you'll get into trouble if you don't. if anybody talks to you, tell them... i do not speak english.
STAR MAN: i do not speak english.
JENNY: right. in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for salt lake city and the new driver will take... ...this part. when you get to salt lake city, ask the driver, 'las vegas, please'...
STAR MAN: 'las vegas, please. i do not speak english.' what is hitchhike?
JENNY: you want this ticket?
STAR MAN: yes.
JENNY: then don't be smart.
P.A. SYSTEM: last call for bus 33 to vermillion, sioux city and omaha... loading at gate 3.
JENNY: that's your bus. when you get to las vegas, ask the driver. 'lathrop wells, please. i do not speak english.'
STAR MAN: 'lathrop wells, please. i do not speak english.'
JENNY: you keep this. now this is hitch- hike... you stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? and you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. when you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
JENNY: your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
STAR MAN: the car will stop?
JENNY: not every car, but... a car will stop... maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
STAR MAN: when do i get to lathrop wells?
JENNY: tomorrow morning. start hitch-hiking right away and...

JENNY: ...you'll have plenty of time to get to where you want to go. 
JENNY: don't worry. they're not going to hurt you. come on. only show this to the driver. nobody else. and don't lose it.
STAR MAN: can i have the gun?
JENNY: no.
JENNY: you might need this.
JENNY: don't be afraid. do what i told you and you'll be okay.
STAR MAN: yes.
JENNY: well... i'm going to go now.
STAR MAN: go?
JENNY: yes. i have a long ride ahead of me... goodbye.
STAR MAN: goodbye.
STAR MAN: jennyhaydn.
JENNY: yes?
STAR MAN: please stay.
JENNY: i'll stay till you get on the bus.
DRIVER: ticket?
JENNY: see? you're going to be okay.
JENNY: goodbye.
STAR MAN: what?
JENNY: it's a kiss... goodbye...
DRIVER: let's go.

JENNY: oh no... 
JENNY: what happened?
STAR MAN: i was afraid.
JENNY: okay, you win. get in.

SHOPKEEPER: this kind of thing's real bad for business... 
TOUGH: he couldn't even speak english.
MOTHER: those kind of people should be shot.
ONLOOKER: what happened?
WAITRESS: i think he was just lost...
BURT: who's side are you on?
TOUGH: no way he was going to get away from me.

SECURITY GUARD: eyewitnesses are the worst. you get two of them together. you got three stories. you know what i mean? 
SECURITY GUARD: is there a reward in this?
SHERMIN: huh?... eh... no, there isn't
SECURITY GUARD: because i'm the one who called the police, you know.
SHERMIN: yeah, thanks. we appreciate that.
SECURITY GUARD: hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... you want my opinion, it's the girl. she had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
SHERMIN: you saw that?
SECURITY GUARD: hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
SECURITY GUARD: eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... but that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
SHERMIN: i wouldn't think so.
SECURITY GUARD: that's what i thought. so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
SHERMIN: we will. something's wrong here. she's helping him now.
LYMAN: i know. she bought him a ticket for lathrop wells and put him on the bus. he didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
SHERMIN: doesn't make sense.
LYMAN: maybe he's turned her into one of them. they enter the crowd around the helicopter.

JENNY: why did your ship land on this planet... on earth? 
STAR MAN: it was a mistake.

JENNY: you thought we were a different planet?! 
STAR MAN: no. my ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
JENNY: stars... when a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
STAR MAN: we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. my... eh... we kidnapped it. on it there was a map that said how to come to earth. this was very important. before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
JENNY: you did? that's funny. so did we.
STAR MAN: yes?
JENNY: yes.
STAR MAN: we told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. just to look from up there. we came and... the driver of my ship...
JENNY: the captain...
STAR MAN: the captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from earth to take home. the police came and shot at us. one of the people from my ship was killed.
JENNY: oh, that's terrible. i'm sorry. was he a good friend?
STAR MAN: i don't understand 'friend.'
JENNY: a friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
STAR MAN: he was a good friend... the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship.
JENNY: the police shouldn't have started shooting. but you can hardly blame them. you surprised them. they didn't know you were up there. when they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
STAR MAN: i understand.
JENNY: sounds like your captain's going to get when he gets back home.
STAR MAN: what is hell?
JENNY: it's bad.
STAR MAN: he will.
JENNY: what are you doing?
STAR MAN: are you my friend?
JENNY: yes.
STAR MAN: i am your friend.

PREACHER: is your creator. is your master. is you savior. is the only reason that you exist. if 
STAR MAN: who is god?
JENNY: nobody knows.
STAR MAN: why?
JENNY: i don't know.

STAR MAN: i like this music. 
JENNY: i've noticed... do you understand what they're saying?
STAR MAN: not all... but it feels like a kiss.
JENNY: do you have music up there?
STAR MAN: yes.
JENNY: i'd like to hear it. can you sing something?
STAR MAN: i do not want to.
JENNY: don't be afraid... i'd really like to hear it.
JENNY: please.
STAR MAN: i am not a good singer.
JENNY: that was beautiful.
STAR MAN: you liked my singing?
JENNY: yes. sing some more.

CLERK: what can i do for you folks? 
JENNY: how much are your rooms?
CLERK: thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
JENNY: you have one with two beds?
CLERK: sure.
JENNY: i'll take that.
CLERK: fill this out. will this be cash or credit card?
JENNY: credit card.
CLERK: i'll have to run your card off now.
JENNY: we're only going to be here a few hours...
CLERK: it's still the full price.
STAR MAN: jenny, look...
JENNY: put that back.
STAR MAN: but i have never seen this before. i am not complete.
JENNY: put it back.
CLERK: you can park your car in front of the room.

STAR MAN: i want a drink. may i have two quarters? 
JENNY: you shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. it's bad for you.
STAR MAN: on the radio they say it's good.
JENNY: hurry up.

STAR MAN: the machine gave me two. should i put one back? 
JENNY: no. get in.
STAR MAN: you can have one.
STAR MAN: are you angry at me?
JENNY: no. i'm just not tired. let's go.

DRIVER: he's got a gun!! 
STAR MAN: jennyhaydn! jennyhaydn!!

LYMAN: one of them must be pretty badly hurt. 
SHERMIN: get this back to the copter.
SHERMIN: mrs. haydn, please come out. we don't want to hurt you or your friend. please put down your weapon and come out.

WOMAN: don't forget to tell the boys where you had a good time. 
DRIVER: you weren't that good.

SHERMIN: tell him i'm not here. 
LYMAN: i did.
SHERMIN: get me a radio. at least i won't have to look at his face.
FOX: we're growing very concerned back here. there's no use pretending otherwise. we're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' people are beginning to ask difficult questions.
SHERMIN: i'll make this as simple as i can, george. they disappeared.
FOX: i don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
SHERMIN: george, listen to what you're saying. this thing's changed itself into a man. disappearing may not be that big a deal.
FOX: so far you've let it cross the heart of america. for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. i don't see the humor in that.
SHERMIN: maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what i got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... i don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
FOX: is that what's affecting your performance?
SHERMIN: i'm not being unpatriotic, and i'm doing my damndest to catch them. bell's up on 80 and i'm down here on 70 past grand junction. they're heading west. if they're not flying we have a good chance of getting them. all i'm asking is that you people think about it.
FOX: you just do your job, shermin. we'll make the policy.

JENNY: hello... hello. 
JENNY: hello. where are you?
STAR MAN: jennyhay...
STAR MAN: ...nd. you are all fixed. i'm sorry you were shot. i was a big problem for you. thank you for your help. i can go to my ship alone now.

JENNY: where did you stop last? 
DRIVER: what the do you think you're doing?
JENNY: where did you stop last?
DRIVER: stay right there...
JENNY: what was your last stop?
DRIVER: elmo's...
JENNY: where's that?
DRIVER: about five miles back.
DRIVER: are there any more in there?

MAN: where are you going? 
STAR MAN: las vegas, please. i do not speak english.
MAN: hop in.

MAN: i can only take you to grand junction, but you'll have a better chance to get a ride from there. 
MAN: where you from?
STAR MAN: i don't understand.
MAN: parlez vous francais?... habla ingles?... sprechen zie deutsch?
MAN: good job, neither do i. what do you do for a living?
STAR MAN: i don't understand.
MAN: i'm a cook. do you understand 'cook?'
STAR MAN: no.
COOK: food. eat. i prepare food. i work as a cook. that's how i make money.
STAR MAN: i understand.
COOK: what do you do?
STAR MAN: i make maps.
COOK: hey, that sounds interesting. you like it?
STAR MAN: eh... yes.
COOK: make any money?
STAR MAN: no.
COOK: you don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. i got a girl going to college this fall. the wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.

COOK: smoke? 
COOK: she wants to become a doctor. she's a bright kid. hard worker. i think she'll make it. but the inflation's driven the tuition up so high it makes it real tough on a family like ours.
COOK: i got two other kids. i don't know what we'll do when they get old enough for college.
COOK: everybody blames it on the oil crisis. that might be where it starts. but i think a lot of people are just using that as an excuse to rip the rest of us off. i see it every day in the kitchen. peaches. we use the gallon cans. the price has gone up three times in the last year. and now the cans are only half full.
COOK: do you have children?
STAR MAN: no.
COOK: they're expensive and a pain in the sometimes, but i wouldn't trade having them for anything.
COOK: what do you think of america?
STAR MAN: it is beautiful.

JENNY: i'm looking for a guy about this tall, with brown hair and really gray eyes... 
JENNY: he had on tan cords, a plaid shirt and a baseball cap... probably hitchhiking.
ATTENDANT: i don't pay much attention to those guys.
JENNY: in the last hour or so...
ATTENDANT: nope.
JENNY: this is him.
ATTENDANT: sorry.
JENNY: you know if anybody here's going to wisconsin?
SECOND ATTENDANT: ask inside.

JENNY: anybody going to... 
JENNY: anybody going to wisconsin?
JENNY: i need a ride.
OLDER MAN: i'm going to des moines. if you can wait till i finish here, you're welcome to ride along.
JENNY: i can wait.
JENNY: where's the phone?
OPERATOR: operator... may i help you?
JENNY: could you give me the highway patrol, please?
MALE: sergeant packert, highway patrol.
JENNY: my name's jenny haydn. i think you're looking for me. i was kidnapped in eau claire, wisconsin a couple of days ago. but i'm free now.
SERGEANT: what was your name again?
JENNY: jenny haydn. i'm on my way home and i don't want anybody i'm with shot at when you...
SERGEANT: hold on.

SHERMIN: you trace it yet? 
TECHNICIAN: all we know right now is that it's east of here.
SHERMIN: this is marc shermin. where are you, mrs. haydn?

JENNY: i don't know. someplace called elmo's. look, i just wanted to tell you that i'm all right and i'm on my way home. 
SHERMIN: you've been through quite an ordeal, mrs. haydn. why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? we'll fly you home.
JENNY: no. you'll want to ask a lot of questions i don't want to answer right now. i already have a ride.

JENNY: i only called to tell you i was free and not to shoot anybody i was with if you see me. 
SHERMIN: is the man who kidnapped you there now?
JENNY: i told you. he let me go. i'm on my way home.
SHERMIN: get a highway patrol unit over there.
SHERMIN: mrs. haydn, i'm going to have to ask you to stay where you are.

OLDER MAN: ready? 
JENNY: mr... i'm sorry, what was your name again?
SHERMIN: marc shermin.
JENNY: mr. shermin, i'm hanging up now. if you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. i'm in the book.
SHERMIN: do you know what you were kidnapped by?
SHERMIN: mrs. haydn...
JENNY: he doesn't want to hurt anybody. please leave him alone.
SHERMIN: is he on his way to lathrop wells?
SHERMIN: what's he planning to do in lathrop wells? is he meeting someone there?
JENNY: i changed my mind. thanks.
JENNY: it's me again...
JENNY: i need a fast ride west.

JENNY: you sure this is your car? 
TEENAGER: my grandmother's rich.
JENNY: slow down, slow down.
TEENAGER: geez, mrs. haydn, we just got going.
JENNY: i told you i'm looking for someone.
TEENAGER: in the cars, too?!
JENNY: i don't know where he is.
TEENAGER: this is going to be a real drag. i thought you wanted to go fast.
TEENAGER: they after you?
JENNY: what? no, of course not.
TEENAGER: would be kinda neat if they were. i think i could outrun them. maybe get my picture in the papers.

COOK: well, here we are... you go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride. 
STAR MAN: thank you.
COOK: and don't be shy about your english. you speak better than a lot of people i know. take care of yourself.

VOICES: ah loves to be frisked! what are they looking for? i'm holding. any way around it? where are you? oh no!! there it is!! 
TEENAGER: i bet you we find your friend at the roadblock.
JENNY: we better find him before that.

SHERMIN: you get that, lyman? 
LYMAN: we're ready.

LONG HAIR: where you going? 
STAR MAN: las vegas, please.
LONG HAIR: we're going to l.a.
LONG HAIR: sure. get in. we can drop you in vegas or get you darn close.

TEENAGER: i'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all. 
JENNY: if he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to vegas?
TEENAGER: fly.
TEENAGER: the five-fifty. we already passed it. but it'll take him way out of his way.
JENNY: pull over. i've got to get back there.
TEENAGER: why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... what did you guys do?... i won't tell anybody.
JENNY: it's easier not to tell if you don't know.
TEENAGER: wait. could i have your autograph?
JENNY: sure.
TEENAGER: i have nothing to do. i'd like to help you.
JENNY: don't worry. i'll be all right.

STAR MAN: i told you goodbye. why are you here? 
JENNY: the police are waiting for you up ahead. there's a roadblock. you have to go back.
STAR MAN: this car will take me to las vegas. i cannot go back.
JENNY: the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. come on.
STAR MAN: if i don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
JENNY: please understand. if you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. i'll get you to your ship. i promise.
STAR MAN: i will go. but not you.
JENNY: you i'll decide if i go or not. not you. i don't know what you do on your planet, but i didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
STAR MAN: i don't want you to be hurt.
JENNY: come on.
JENNY: i didn't ask to come along on this trip, but i sure as am going to be the one to say when i get off.

JENNY: where are you going? 
STAR MAN: i must meet my ship.
JENNY: why can't we wait here for a ride?
STAR MAN: i feel better if i move.
JENNY: we're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
STAR MAN: asshole!!
JENNY: where did you learn that?
STAR MAN: the cook.

JENNY: we're not going to get a ride tonight. 
STAR MAN: i can't stay on this planet.
JENNY: no one's traveling in this weather.
STAR MAN: you promised you would get me to my ship.
JENNY: i will. i will. we still have another day.
STAR MAN: you promised.
JENNY: what do you want from me? there are no cars on this road. i didn't ask for this stupid storm.
JENNY: what are you saying?
STAR MAN: you can stop. i will go on alone.
JENNY: we're too far away to walk. don't you understand?
STAR MAN: i can't stay here. i want to go home. i don't want this skin. i don't want to look like this.
JENNY: why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
STAR MAN: i used the last one to jump off the cliff...
JENNY: let's find a place out of the rain. i'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
STAR MAN: i can't be late. i don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. i don't know if my words went to the ship. if i'm not there, the captain will think i'm dead and go.
JENNY: we'll get a ride in the morning.

JENNY: can you close the door? 
STAR MAN: you are cold.
JENNY: you're right i am.
STAR MAN: i do not get cold.
JENNY: open your shirt.
JENNY: take your shirt off.
STAR MAN: what?
JENNY: nothing.

JENNY: good morning. 
STAR MAN: horses.
JENNY: you don't forget anything, do you?
STAR MAN: no.
JENNY: hello... hello. how are you this morning?
STAR MAN: do they talk?!
JENNY: no, they don't talk... we talk to them.
STAR MAN: i understand.
JENNY: oh, you're pretty...
STAR MAN: i gave you a baby last night.
STAR MAN: they are beautiful.
JENNY: yes, they are.
STAR MAN: you have been very good to me, jennyhaydn. you said you wanted a baby, so i gave you one.
JENNY: but...
STAR MAN: it will be human and it will look like this. but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know. that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have.
JENNY: i told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
STAR MAN: you will have this baby. if you want it. if you don't, i can stop it now.
JENNY: i want it.

SHERMIN: hello george. 
FOX: shermin...
SHERMIN: what's all this for?
FOX: we have a new directive. i'm taking over.
SHERMIN: we don't have to do it that way. we can catch him this time.
FOX: washington thinks it's too late for that.
SHERMIN: i've never been taken off an assignment in my life. give me twenty- four hours and i'll have him for you.
FOX: you're not hearing me.
SHERMIN: you can change a directive, george. you've done it before. listen to me. he's going somewhere in death valley. lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop. east is the nuclear site. there are no roads in there. she was teaching him to hitchhike. i'm telling you. we block the four roads into death valley and we got him.
FOX: we'll do that. but how are we going to hold him? he can change himself into a man. he can disappear.
SHERMIN: that's the chance we have to take.
FOX: no, we don't.
SHERMIN: then you're going to have to do it without me.
FOX: you're a career intelligence officer, shermin. you'll be in the air with us.
SHERMIN: you're talking about taking a life. the most unique life form on this planet. i think we're better than that.

STAR MAN: is this gambling? 
STAR MAN: the cowboys were right. you can make money fast gambling.
JENNY: you don't make money gambling. you lose it.

JENNY: do you have a good map of death valley? 
CLERK: we should have. let me see.
STAR MAN: may i have twenty-five cents, please?
JENNY: what for?
STAR MAN: i want to gamble.
JENNY: here are two quarters. when you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
STAR MAN: i understand. thank you.

JENNY: this is crazy. we don't have time for this. 
STAR MAN: i know how to gamble now.
JENNY: you won ten dollars. big deal. if we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
STAR MAN: i want to get money for you and the baby.
JENNY: i don't need any money for the baby. i'll be fine.
STAR MAN: inflation, tuition, college. children are expensive. i know.
JENNY: the cook again?
STAR MAN: yes.
JENNY: if i ever run into that guy, i'm going to kick his ass.

JENNY: it'll tell you pretty much everything about us... 
STAR MAN: this is very interesting. we are born knowing our history. we have other books. but not a book like this.
JENNY: any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
STAR MAN: i understand.
JENNY: it'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how america came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
STAR MAN: many of my people will not believe those things are possible. on my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. i will be asked a lot of questions.
JENNY: what will you say about us?
STAR MAN: i will say that we can be friends.
JENNY: we can.
JENNY: this is yours...
STAR MAN: if you want to keep it, you can.
JENNY: i'd like to...
JENNY: would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
STAR MAN: you want the baby to laugh at me.
JENNY: yes.

JENNY: how long will it take you to get home? 
STAR MAN: many, many days and nights...
JENNY: would you like to listen to some music?
JENNY: i'm sure we could find a country and western station.
STAR MAN: no, thank you.
JENNY: don't worry. everything's going to be fine.
JENNY: which star is yours?
STAR MAN: there.
JENNY: where?
STAR MAN: the yellow one.
JENNY: oh, wow... i'll tell you what. when the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
STAR MAN: i will wave to you.
STAR MAN: oh,

JENNY: they're trying to get him. 
JENNY: what are you doing?!!
FOX: mrs. haydn...

FOX: this is george fox... 
JENNY: i want to speak to marc shermin.
FOX: you can speak to me, mrs. haydn. i'm in charge of this operation now.

JENNY: if i don't speak to mr. shermin, i'm hanging up. 
FOX: okay...

JENNY: here he is. 
SHERMIN: hello...
STAR MAN: i must get to my ship, mr. shermin.
SHERMIN: we can't let you do that.
STAR MAN: i don't want to hurt anybody. i just want to go home.
SHERMIN: all the roads into death valley are blocked. we'd like to talk to you.
STAR MAN: if i talk to you, i will miss my ship.
SHERMIN: hold on a minute... let's take the chance, george.
FOX: no deal.

SHERMIN: i'm afraid we can't let you go. 
STAR MAN: i understand.

JENNY: where do you think you're going? 
STAR MAN: thank you, jennyhaydn. you are good. i must go alone now.
JENNY: i said i would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.

JENNY: it works. 
STAR MAN: i do not know how many times i can do this.

SHERMIN: george... do you hear me, george? 
FOX: what?
SHERMIN: i just retired.
FOX: shermin!! shermin!!!
SHERMIN: let's get out of here.

FOX: shermin!!! 
FOX: lock in.

JENNY: well... 
STAR MAN: i must go.
STAR MAN: what do i do now?
JENNY: you say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
STAR MAN: i love you.
JENNY: i'm never going to see you again, am

STAR MAN: no. 
JENNY: i love you.
STAR MAN: tell the baby about me.
JENNY: i will.
STAR MAN: goodbye.
JENNY: wait!!
STAR MAN: thank you, jennyhaydn.
