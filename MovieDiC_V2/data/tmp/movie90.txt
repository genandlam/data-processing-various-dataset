MRS. BEAUMONT: he had a cerebral hemorrhage and they think there's some sort of clot, or tumor, or something in there. they're doing all sorts of tests. on the surface, he looks pretty good, but there are problems. they think he may have to stay in two weeks now, at least. you can go see him though tomorrow, jeffrey. 
AUNT BARBARA: they tore down the a and p, jeffrey. did you see that?
JEFFREY: aunt barbara that was 5 years ago.

JEFFREY: what time are visiting hours?
MRS. BEAUMONT: i've made arrangements with dr. gynde for 10:30. but jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; i need the car this morning.
JEFFREY: well. okay.
MRS. BEAUMONT: jeffrey, when you see your father.
JEFFREY: yeah?
MRS. BEAUMONT: he doesn't know you're out of school. he thinks it's a vacation for you.
JEFFREY: what?
MRS. BEAUMONT: it would be too much for him. so please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
JEFFREY: thanks a lot, mom.
MRS. BEAUMONT: .jeffrey!. nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. i hope so.
AUNT BARBARA: i think it's important not to get depressed. depression is a terrible thing. they say it can bring on illness.

NURSE CINDY: please wait outside while dr. gynde prepares him to see you. 
JEFFREY: prepares him?

DR. GYNDE: hello jeffrey. 
JEFFREY: hello, doctor gynde. how is he?
DR. GYNDE: he's fighting hard. jeffrey. it's very important that your father doesn't try to move. he's been immobilized. it would be very painful for him. sit close. you do the talking and moving. he knows you're here. he became very emotional. i don't think he likes the idea of you seeing him like this.
JEFFREY: hi dad.
MR. BEAUMONT: hey jeff.
JEFFREY: looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
MR. BEAUMONT: uh uh.
JEFFREY: are you feeling okay?
MR. BEAUMONT: uh uh.
MR. BEAUMONT: good to see you, son.
JEFFREY: it's good to see you, dad.

JEFFREY: hello. could you tell me if detective williams is still working here? 
POLICE OFFICER: he's up in room 221. right up the stairs.

JEFFREY: are you detective williams? 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: yes.
JEFFREY: my name is jeffrey beaumont - i live near you. i believe you know my father, tom beaumont - beaumont's hardware store?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: sure i do. i understand he's in the hospital. how is he?
JEFFREY: he's alright, i guess. i hope. they're doing tests, that's why i'm home from school. i was over at the hospital this morning and i was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind vista, i found an ear.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: you did? a human ear?
JEFFREY: yeah. i've got it here in this bag. i thought i should bring it to you.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: yep, that's right. let's take a look at it.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: that sure looks like a human ear, doesn't it?. let's run it down to the coroner's office and see what they make of it. then, i want you to show me exactly where you found it.

CORONER'S OFFICER: the tests will take awhile. meanwhile, we'll check the morgue records. i don't recall anything coming in minus an ear. 
CORONER'S OFFICER: now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a heart, or even an arm, we would assume that there was a corpse, however, a finger or an ear. the person may very well be alive somewhere.
JEFFREY: what can you tell about the person from the ear?
CORONER'S OFFICER: well. when the tests are done, quite a lot . sex, blood type, whether or not the ear came off a dead person. right now, i know what you know. it's a real human ear. the human was, or is, caucasian. . also. it looks like the ear was cut off with scissors.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: by the way, jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and i'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. got it? 
JEFFREY: got it. thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: come on. i'll drive you home. it's on my way.

JEFFREY: i'm going out for awhile. 
MRS. BEAUMONT: do you want the car?
JEFFREY: no, i'm just gonna walk around.
MRS. BEAUMONT: alright.
AUNT BARBARA: jeffrey. you're not going down by lincoln, are you?
JEFFREY: no. i'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. don't worry.

JEFFREY: hello. uh. my name is jeffrey beaumont. is detective williams in? 
MRS. WILLIAMS: oh, yes, jeffrey. come in. he'll be back any minute now. you're welcome to wait. is it urgent?

JEFFREY: i just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. maybe i better go. 
MRS. WILLIAMS: really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
JEFFREY: alright.

MRS. WILLIAMS: i was sorry to hear about your father. i know your mother from church. it's such a shame. 
JEFFREY: yeah, i know.
MRS. WILLIAMS: would you like a piece of cake?
JEFFREY: no. no thank you.
MRS. WILLIAMS: it's a real good chocolate cake. duncan hines' devil's food. real good.
JEFFREY: yeah. okay.

MRS. WILLIAMS: sandy?. 
MRS. WILLIAMS: jeffery, this is my daughter, sandy, and. her boyfriend, mike.
SANDY: mike's gotta go. nice to meet you.
MIKE: yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
JEFFREY: yeah. it was nice meeting you too.
MRS. WILLIAMS: he comes over to study.
JEFFREY: yeah.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: pam?
MRS. WILLIAMS: in the kitchen, john!
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: oh. hello, jeffrey. what's up?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: come into the study a minute.
JEFFREY: excuse me, mrs. williams.
MRS. WILLIAMS: certainly.

DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: shut the door. 
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: detective williams here. yeah. tell him to go to sergeant milton. yeah, copy. well, jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. very interesting. i know you must be curious to know more. but. i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. one day. when it's all sewed up, i'll let you know all the details. right now, though. i can't.
JEFFREY: i understand. i'm just real curious like you said.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: i was the same way when i was you age. i guess that's what got me into this business.
JEFFREY: it must be great.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: and it's horrible too. i'm sorry jeffrey. that's the way it has to be. anyway. i'm sure you do understand.

JEFFREY: mrs. williams? thanks for the cake. 
MRS. WILLIAMS: oh, you're welcome. nice to finally meet you, jeffrey.
JEFFREY: say "goodnight" to sandy.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: we will. good night.

SANDY: are you the one that found the ear. 
JEFFREY: yeah, how did you know?
SANDY: i just know, that's all. i remember you from central.
54. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT: they slowly walk down the street together.
JEFFREY: oh yeah?
SANDY: you were pretty popular. didn't you run for some office?
JEFFREY: yeah i did. treasurer. shouldn't you be studying or something.
SANDY: am i bothering you?
JEFFREY: no. you're not bothering me. you a senior?
SANDY: yes.
JEFFREY: how is central these days?
SANDY: terrible. boring.
JEFFREY: what else is new?. right?
SANDY: yeah. what are you doing now?
JEFFREY: i'm home from school. my father's in the hospital.
SANDY: that's too bad.
JEFFREY: what do you know about the ear?. anything?
SANDY: didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
JEFFREY: come on. you brought it up. do you know anything?
SANDY: i don't really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things. my room is right above my father's office. the ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. that's direct from the coroner's office. the person is unknown. there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on, but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. i heard some of the same names.
JEFFREY: do you know who was brought in for questioning?
SANDY: there were at least three, maybe four. but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. there's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
JEFFREY: were all these people questioned this afternoon?
SANDY: no. this has been going on for some time . several months. about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. they were from people who were reported missing. they never found one complete body. only parts.
JEFFREY: the ear is from a missing person maybe?
SANDY: maybe so.
JEFFREY: it's a strange world isn't it? do you know what building the woman lives in?
SANDY: yeah. it's close by. that's what's creepy. they've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except i don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
JEFFREY: i guess you have to get back home soon?
SANDY: not really, why? you want to see the building?. come on, i'll show you.

SANDY: that's the building. she lives on the seventh floor. don't stop to look long . the police are watching. 
JEFFREY: where are they?
SANDY: i don't know. you're not supposed to see them. they're supposed to see you.
JEFFREY: did they find out anything when they questioned her?
SANDY: i don't know. like i said, she's not my father's case.
JEFFREY: oh yeah. what about those other people?
SANDY: my father is watching the businessman. the businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. they think he's been murdered.
JEFFREY: you really do hear a lot, don't you?
SANDY: yeah, i guess so. what are you going to do now that you're home?
JEFFREY: i have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
SANDY: still, it must be kinda rough.
JEFFREY: it's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father. i used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world. jeffrey and sandy both laugh.
SANDY: what happened to him?
JEFFREY: i don't know. he moved away.

57. EXT. WILLIAMS HOME - NIGHT: they arrive back at sandy's home. 
CLOSER ON JEFFREY AND SANDY: in front of sandy's home.
SANDY: i've gotta go in.
JEFFREY: thanks for the tour. it was nice talking to you.
JEFFREY: i guess i'll see you sometime.
SANDY: i guess so. like you said. it's a strange world.
JEFFREY: yeah. good bye.

JEFFREY: you hungry or thirsty, or both? 
SANDY: i don't know.
JEFFREY: i'd like to talk to you about something.
SANDY: just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
SANDY: please, don't say anything to mike. promise?
JEFFREY: i don't want to cause any trouble.
SANDY: i'm here, aren't i?
JEFFREY: i guess mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
SANDY: ooooo, you are smart. just don't get too smart.

SANDY: alright, now tell me. what is it? 
JEFFREY: there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. i got to thinking. i'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
SANDY: you said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. this gives me the creeps.
JEFFREY: settle down. i have a plan which i think will work. there is very little for you to do, but i do need your help. .aren't you curious about my plan?
SANDY: it wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, i guess.
JEFFREY: alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later.
SANDY: now, how are you going to do that?
JEFFREY: right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. i will spray her apartment. after a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window.
SANDY: what will i say when she comes to the door?
JEFFREY: you will be a jehovah's witness. i have a few "awake" magazines for you. you don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all i'll need. whatiya think?
SANDY: i don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
JEFFREY: let's just try the first part. if that goes well, we'll see about the rest. no one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
SANDY: you've got a point there.

JEFFREY: now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. i can stall if it's more, but i need time to find a good window .alright? 
SANDY: alright.
JEFFREY: let's go.

JEFFREY: okay, i'm going ahead. wait a minute, what's her name? 
SANDY: oh bother. dorothy vallens, seventh floor. look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
JEFFREY: thanks. dorothy vallens. okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
SANDY: alright. good luck, yourself.

OLD LADY: well, it's about time you came. 
JEFFREY: that's a good sign.
DOROTHY: yes? what is it?
JEFFREY: pest control. gotta do your apartment.
DOROTHY: oh that stuff stinks.
JEFFREY: nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
DOROTHY: oh yeah, that's good.

DOROTHY: what is this. grand central station? 
JEFFREY: that oughta do it.
DOROTHY: yeah.

SANDY: are you alright? 
JEFFREY: yeah. let's get outta here. what happened?
SANDY: i was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. was it alright?
JEFFREY: yes and no. did you recognize him?
SANDY: no. i only saw his back. he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
JEFFREY: i didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. i didn't have time to get a window, but i found this key. pretty nifty, huh?
SANDY: yeah, if it opens the door.
JEFFREY: yeah.
JEFFREY: you go first.

SANDY: so. what's next? 
JEFFREY: pretty clever. are you game for more?
SANDY: i owe you. since i goofed up this one.
JEFFREY: you didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. i want to sneak in tonight. it's friday. do you have a date tonight?
SANDY: yes. i do.
JEFFREY: well, it's friday night and you're a beautiful girl. i guess you would have a date. that does that.
SANDY: you really want to do this, don't you?
JEFFREY: i don't want you to get involved, really, i mean, i do, but if something went wrong i mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder. they pull up in front of sandy's house.
SANDY: i'll tell mike i'm sick. there's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. afterwards he can go out with the guys. just so the record is kept straight though, i love mike. what do want me to do?
JEFFREY: first of all, we'll have a nice dinner.
SANDY: i already know. the "slow club." it's on route 7.
JEFFREY: great. i'll pick you up around eight o'clock. is that good?
SANDY: yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. i'll walk over to your house. i'll be there at eight o'clock.
JEFFREY: okay. you better get out before someone sees us.
JEFFREY: see ya!

DR. GYNDE: that will take care of you, frances, for another week. i don't want you to overdo things either. take it very easy. 
AUNT BARBARA: i'll see to it, bill.
DR. GYNDE: good.
MRS. BEAUMONT: i feel fine.
DR. GYNDE: that's not the point. you're under a great deal of stress. don't overdo it. don't be foolish. jeffrey enters the room - to say goodnight.
JEFFREY: doctor gynde. my whole family's sick.
AUNT BARBARA: i'm not sick.
AUNT BARBARA: we'll see who stays in my will.
JEFFREY: can i use the car tonight?
MRS. BEAUMONT: of course, jeffrey.

SANDY: what's the plan. 
JEFFREY: first of all, we're going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens. we'll watch her for awhile. i'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
SANDY: brilliant.
JEFFREY: then we'll drive back to her apartment and i will plant myself there.
SANDY: this is not my usual friday night!

SLEAZY MAITRE D': good evening. two? 
JEFFREY: yeah. could we get a small table in the back?

JEFFREY: here's to. an interesting experience.
SANDY: i'll drink to that.

SANDY: jeffrey, i don't think you ought to do it. 
JEFFREY: why not?
SANDY: it's crazy and dangerous. my i shouldn't have told you.
JEFFREY: it'll be okay. i don't think you should wait out here though. i think you should go home. can you drive this car?
SANDY: yeah. but.
JEFFREY: leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?

JEFFREY: could you wait a little while. this key may not fit. 
SANDY: . i wish you wouldn't do this. it doesn't make any sense. let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
JEFFREY: i'm going in, sandy. i'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.

SANDY: you want a dairy queen?
JEFFREY: no way. i'm about to blow up.

SANDY: you want to tell me about it? 
JEFFREY: . ok. it's a strange world, sandy. this is what i have found out. what i think i have found out. dorothy vallens is married to a man named don. they have a son. i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of don's ears. i think he is holding them to make her do things for him. i think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. i call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. i don't know what he does but i think he's on drugs supplied by frank. frank is a very dangerous man.
SANDY: wow. should you tell my father?
JEFFREY: i don't see how i can. and i can't prove any of this. i got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
SANDY: you saw a lot in one night.
JEFFREY: . actually. i've been in twice.
SANDY: twice. without her sensing anything?
JEFFREY: yes.
SANDY: did you see her undressed?
JEFFREY: yeah. i mean. a little, . you know.
SANDY: yeah?
JEFFREY: that doesn't bother you, does it?
SANDY: who, me? why should it?
JEFFREY: that's what i thought.
SANDY: you're sure right. it is a strange world.
JEFFREY: why are there people like frank. why is there so much trouble in this world.?
SANDY: i don't know. i had a dream. in fact. the night i met you. . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. i guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
JEFFREY: yeah i guess so. you're a neat girl.
SANDY: so are you. i mean you're a neat guy. we better get back.
JEFFREY: i guess so. you want to help me watch frank?. i'm going to stake out frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.

SANDY: no, silly - i'm still in school you know. but i'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. you better be careful, jeffrey. 
JEFFREY: i will. i'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
SANDY: okay. be careful.
JEFFREY: okay, sandy.

JEFFREY: can i give you a kiss good night? 
SANDY: you better not, jeffrey.
