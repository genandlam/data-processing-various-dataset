LORETTA: you've got to come. you've got to give me away.
COSMO: i didn't give you away the first time.
LORETTA: and maybe that's why i had the bad luck. maybe if you gave me away, and i got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then i wouldn't had the bad luck i had.

LORETTA: yes.
RONNY: why?
LORETTA: i'm going to marry him.
RONNY: you are going to marry my brother?
LORETTA: yes. do you want...
RONNY: i have no life.
LORETTA: excuse me.
RONNY: i have no life. my brother johnny took my life from me.
LORETTA: i don't understand.
RONNY: and now he's getting married. he has his, he's getting his. and he wants me to come? what is life?
LORETTA: i didn't come here to upset you.
RONNY: they say bread is life. so i bake bread, bread, bread. and the years go by! by! by! and i sweat and shovel this stinking dough in and outta this hot hole in the wall and i should be so happy, huh, sweetheart? you want me to come to the wedding of my brother johnny?!! where is my wedding? chrissy! over by the wall! gimme the big knife!
CHRISSY: no, ronny!
RONNY: gimme the big knife! i'm gonna cut my throat!
LORETTA: maybe i should come back another time.
RONNY: no, i want you to see this! i want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! chrissy, gimme the big knife!
CHRISSY: i tell you i won't do it!
RONNY: do you know about me?
BARBARA: oh, mr. cammareri!
RONNY: nothing is anybody's fault, but things happen. look.
RONNY: it's wood. it's fake. five years ago i was engaged to be married. johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i wasn't paying attention. the slicer chewed off my hand. it's funny 'cause - when my fiancã© saw that i was maimed, she left me for another man.
LORETTA: that's the bad blood between you and johnny?
RONNY: that's it.
LORETTA: but that wasn't johnny's fault.
RONNY: i don't care! i ain't no freakin monument to justice! i lost my hand, i lost my bride! johnny has his hand, johnny has his bride! you come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
RONNY: is it just a matter of time till a man opens his eyes and gives up his one dream of happiness? maybe. maybe. all i have... have you come here, stranger, bride of my brother, to take these last few loaves from my table? alright. alright.
CHRISSY: this is the most tormented man i have ever known. i am in love with this man. he doesn't know that. i never told him cause he can never love anybody since he lost his hand and his girl.
CHRISSY: here. why don't you just kill him? it would be so much more kind than coming here and inviting him to a wedding like he'll never have.

LORETTA: where you live? 
RONNY: upstairs.
LORETTA: come on.

COSMO: and then there is copper, which is the only pipe i use. it costs money. but it costs money because it saves money. 
MONA: and what did they say?
COSMO: the man understood me. the woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that i was right.
MONA: you have such a head for knowing. you know everything.
COSMO: i brought you something.
COSMO: it's a present.
MONA: oh, cosmo!
COSMO: they are little stars and birds. birds fly to the stars, i guess.

LORETTA: you ready for the coffee? 
RONNY: loretta. what's that smell?
LORETTA: i'm making you a steak.
RONNY: you don't have to help me.
LORETTA: i know that. i do what i want.
RONNY: i like it well done.
LORETTA: you'll eat this to feed your blood.

RONNY: this is good. uhh... 
LORETTA: loretta.
RONNY: where'd johnny find you?
LORETTA: he knew my husband who died.
RONNY: how'd he die?
LORETTA: bus hit him.
RONNY: fast.
LORETTA: instantaneous.
RONNY: when you get engaged?
LORETTA: yesterday.
RONNY: why?
LORETTA: why what?
RONNY: i don't know.
LORETTA: so. five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. no woman since then?
RONNY: no.
LORETTA: stupid.
RONNY: when your husband get hit by the bus?
LORETTA: seven years ago.
RONNY: how many men since then?
LORETTA: just johnny.
RONNY: stupid yourself.
LORETTA: no. unlucky. i have not been lucky.
RONNY: i don't care about luck, you understand me? it ain't that.
LORETTA: what? do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
RONNY: why you talking to me?
LORETTA: you got any whiskey? how 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?

RONNY: she was right to leave me. 
LORETTA: you think so?
RONNY: yes.
LORETTA: you really are stupid, you know that.
RONNY: you don't know nothing about it.
LORETTA: i was raised that a girl gets married young. i didn't get married until i was twenty-eight. i met a man. i loved him. i married him. he wanted to have a baby right away. i said no. then he got hit by a bus. no man. no baby. no nothing! i did not know that man was a gift i could not keep. i didn't know... you tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but i see what the true story is, and you can't. she didn't leave you! you can't see what you are. i can see everything. you are a wolf!
RONNY: i'm a wolf?
LORETTA: the big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. this woman was a trap for you. she caught you and you could not get away. so you chewed off your foot! that was the price you had to pay to be free. johnny had nothing to do with it. you did what you had to do, between you and you, and i know i'm right, i don't care what you say. and now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. that's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. you are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
RONNY: what are you doing!
LORETTA: i'm telling you your life!
RONNY: stop it!
LORETTA: no!
RONNY: why are you marrying johnny? he's a fool!
LORETTA: because i have no luck!
RONNY: he made me look the wrong way and i cut off my hand. he could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
LORETTA: i am looking where i should to become a bride!
RONNY: a bride without a head!
LORETTA: a wolf without a foot!
LORETTA: wait a minute! wait a minute!
RONNY: it's like i'm falling! it's like i'm in the ocean!
LORETTA: i have no luck!
RONNY: son of a
LORETTA: where are you taking me?
RONNY: to the bed.
LORETTA: oh. oh i don't care about anything. i don't care about anything! take me to the bed. he carries her away, into the bedroom.

RONNY: i can't believe what is happening. 
LORETTA: me neither.
RONNY: i was dead.
LORETTA: i was dead, too.
RONNY: your blood.
LORETTA: all my life i have never reached a man. i knew that i would reach my husband, but i took my time and he was dead. ronny.
RONNY: loretta.
LORETTA: i want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. i want you to swallow me.
RONNY: i've got you.
LORETTA: get all of me. take everything.
RONNY: what about johnny?
LORETTA: you're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. me dry!
RONNY: alright. alright. there will be nothing left.

RAYMOND: i never seen anybody so in love like cosmo back then! he'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. i never told you this cause it's not really a story. but one time i woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. like a flashlight. i couldn't think a what it was. i looked out the window, and it was the moon! big as a house! i never seen the moon so big before or since. i was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. and i looked down, and standing there in the street was cosmo, looking up at the windows. this is the funny part. i got mad at you, cosmo! i thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. i was half asleep i guess and didn't know no better.
COSMO: you were altogether asleep. you were dreaming.
RAYMOND: no. you were there.
COSMO: i don't wanna talk about it.
ROSE: well, what do you wanna talk about!
COSMO: rita. pass the wine.

RITA: is who down there?
RAYMOND: cosmo.
RITA: what would he be doing down there?
RAYMOND: i don't know.

ROSE: fine.
JIMMY: enjoy your meal.
BOBO: good evening mrs. castorini. you eating alone tonight?
ROSE: hello, bobo. yes. let me have a martini, no ice and two olives.
BOBO: very good.
SHEILA'S VOICE: i'm trying to explain to you how i feel. every time i try to explain how i feel, you explain how you feel. i don't think that's really much of a response.
UNSEEN MAN'S VOICE: well, its the only response i've got.
BOBO: you wanna see a menu?
ROSE: not yet. i'll wave.
SHEILA'S VOICE: i really do hate it though, when you take that tone with me. like you're above it all and isn't it amusing.
MAN'S VOICE: but it is, isn't it?
SHEILA'S VOICE: not to me! this is my life, no matter how comical it may seem to you. i don't need some man standing above the struggle while i roll around in the mud!
MAN'S VOICE: i think you like the mud and i don't. that's fair, isn't it? if i don't care to...
PERRY: sorry about that, folks. she's a very pretty mental patient.
PERRY: don't mind about me. but could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
SHY WAITER: absolutely!
PERRY: i'm sorry if we disturbed you.
ROSE: i'm not disturbed. by you.
PERRY: my lady friend has a personality disorder.
ROSE: she was just too young for you.
PERRY: thanks, comrade.
SHY WAITER: it's nothing!
PERRY: ouch. too young! i just got that. you know how to hurt guy. how old are you?
ROSE: none of your business.
PERRY: sorry. that was rude.
ROSE: will you join me for dinner?
PERRY: are you sure?
PERRY: then i'd be delighted. i hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often i end up doing just that.

ROSE: what do you do? 
PERRY: i'm a professor. i teach communications at n.y.u.
ROSE: that woman was a student of yours?
PERRY: sheila? yes she was. is. was.
ROSE: there's old saying my mother told me. would you like to hear it?
PERRY: yes.
ROSE: don't where you eat.
PERRY: i'll remember that. what do you do?
ROSE: i'm a housewife.
PERRY: then why are you eating alone?
ROSE: i'm not eating alone. can i ask you a question?
PERRY: go ahead.
ROSE: why do men chase women?
PERRY: nerves.
ROSE: i think it's because they fear death.
PERRY: maybe. listen. you wanna know why i chase women? i find women charming.
PERRY: i teach these classes i've taught for a million years. the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. i started off, i was excited about something and i wanted to share it. now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. except sometimes. sometimes i'm droning along and i look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and i'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. and when that happens, when i look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was, then i ask her out on a date. it doesn't last. it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that i'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. and at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
ROSE: what you don't know about women is a lot.

LORETTA: they get some turnout for this stuff. 
RONNY: it's the best thing there is.
LORETTA: i like parts of it, but i don't really get it.
MONA: you haven't once said you like my dress.
COSMO: i like your dress. it's very bright.
MONA: why you looking around so much?
COSMO: i don't know. i got a feeling.
MONA: i'm wearing your bracelet.

PERRY: may i walk with you a ways? 
ROSE: sure.

PERRY: you knew that man? 
ROSE: yes.

LORETTA: that was just so... awful! 
RONNY: awful?
LORETTA: beautiful. sad. she died!
RONNY: yeah.
LORETTA: i couldn't believe it! i didn't think she was going to die. i knew she was sick...
RONNY: she had tb.
LORETTA: i know. she was coughing her brains out. and still, she had to sing all the time...
LORETTA: pop?
COSMO: wait for me by the doors, mona.
LORETTA: pop? what are you doing here?
COSMO: excuse me.
LORETTA: mona?
COSMO: what'd you do to your hair?
LORETTA: i got it done.
COSMO: what are you doing here?
LORETTA: what are you doing here?
COSMO: who is this man? you're engaged!
LORETTA: you're married.
COSMO: you're my daughter. i won't have you acting like a tramp!
LORETTA: you're my father.
COSMO: alright. i didn't see you here.
LORETTA: i don't know whether i saw you or not.

LORETTA LOOKING AFTER THEM, STRICKEN: ronny appears at her side, solicitous. 
RONNY: let's get outta here. i'll buy you a drink.
LORETTA: that wasn't my mother.

ROSE'S VOICE: that's my house. 
PERRY'S VOICE: you mean the whole house?
ROSE'S VOICE: yes.
PERRY'S VOICE: my it's a mansion!
ROSE'S VOICE: it's a house.
PERRY'S VOICE: i live in a one-bedroom apartment. what exactly does your husband do?
ROSE'S VOICE: he's a plumber.
PERRY'S VOICE: well. that explains it. the sound of the wind can be heard rising up.

PERRY: temperature's dropping. 
ROSE: yes.
PERRY: i guess you can't invite me in?
ROSE: no.
PERRY: people home.
ROSE: no. i think the house is empty. i can't invite you in because i'm married and because i know who i am.
PERRY: i'm a little cold.
ROSE: you're a little boy and you like to be bad.
PERRY: we could go to my apartment. you could see how the other half lives.
ROSE: i'm too old for you.
PERRY: i'm too old for me. that's my predicament.
ROSE: good night.
PERRY: good night. can i kiss you on the cheek, too?
ROSE: sure.
PERRY: i'm freezing
ROSE: good night.

AL: another old-fashion? 
RONNY: loretta?
LORETTA: no thanks.
RONNY: i think that's it.
RONNY: what do you want to do now?
LORETTA: i wanna go home.

LORETTA: it's really cold. 
RONNY: yeah. it smells like snow.
LORETTA: my mother guessed that my father was seeing somebody and i told her she was crazy. she looked like a real piece of cheap goods. but who am i to talk?
RONNY: what's the matter?
LORETTA: how can you ask me that?
RONNY: you're making me feel guilty again.
LORETTA: you are guilty. i'm guilty.
RONNY: of what? only can point the finger, loretta.
LORETTA: i know what i know.
RONNY: and what do you know? you tell me my life? i'll tell you yours. i'm a wolf? you run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! you're gonna marry my brother? why you wanna sell your life short? playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. you waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
LORETTA: he didn't come!
RONNY: i'm here!
LORETTA: you're late!
RONNY: we're here.
LORETTA: this is your place.
RONNY: that's right.
LORETTA: this is where we're going!
RONNY: yeah.
LORETTA: the deal was if i came to the opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
LORETTA: i went with you. now i'm gonna marry johnny and you're gonna leave me alone. right? a person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their luck. maybe my nature does draw me to you, but i don't haveta go with that. i can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! i can do that. otherwise, what is this stupid life that gave us for what? ronny? are you listening to me?
RONNY: yeah.
LORETTA: i'm really afraid.
RONNY: why?
LORETTA: i'm afraid of who i am.
RONNY: i was.
LORETTA: and you're not now?
LORETTA: why not?
RONNY: i don't know. everything seems like nothing now against that i want you in my bed. i don't care if i burn in hell. i don't care if you burn in hell. the past and future is a joke to me now. i see that they're nothing, i see they ain't here. the only thing that's here is you. and me. i want you to come upstairs. now. i tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but i couldn't. i couldn't take everything in a hundred years. it's the way we are. we compound each other.
LORETTA: let me go home.
RONNY: no.
LORETTA: let me go home.
RONNY: no.
LORETTA: i'm freezing to death.
RONNY: come upstairs. i don't care why you come. no, that's not what i mean. loretta, i love you. not like they told you love is and i didn't know this either. but love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. we're not here to make things perfect. snowflakes are perfect. the stars are perfect. not us. we are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! the storybooks are come upstairs with me, baby! don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! red meat just like me! it's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! you're a wolf just like me! come upstairs with me and get in my bed! come on! come on! come on!

MR. JOHNNY: hello. i'm sorry to call so late... 
ROSE: moving in?
MR. JOHNNY: i came right from the airport.
ROSE: come on in.

MR. JOHNNY: can you wake up loretta? i need to talk to her. 
ROSE: she's not home yet. take off your coat and come in the living room. i'll make you a drink. i wanna talk to you.

MR. JOHNNY: thank you. 
ROSE: so.
MR. JOHNNY: where is she?
ROSE: out. i don't know where. i was waiting up for my husband.
MR. JOHNNY: it's late.
ROSE: yes.
MR. JOHNNY: maybe i should go?
ROSE: what are you doing here? you're supposed to be in palermo.
MR. JOHNNY: that's what i came to tell loretta. there's been a miracle.
ROSE: a miracle. well, that's news.
MR. JOHNNY: my mother's recovered.
ROSE: you're kidding?
MR. JOHNNY: the breath had almost totally left her body. she was as white as snow. and then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. the mourners. and me. and herself! she ate a meal that would choke a pig!
ROSE: that's incredible.
MR. JOHNNY: yes.
ROSE: hello pop.
MR. JOHNNY: who was that?
ROSE: that was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. listen, johnny, there's a question i want to ask you. and i want you to tell me the truth if you can. why do men chase women?
MR. JOHNNY: well. there's the bible story. took a rib from adam and made eve. maybe men chase women to get the rib back. when took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
ROSE: but why would a man need more than one woman?
MR. JOHNNY: i don't know. maybe because he fears death.
ROSE: that's it! that's the reason!
MR. JOHNNY: i don't know.
ROSE: no, that's really it. thank you for answering my question.
COSMO: hi. hi.
MR. JOHNNY: hello, mr. castorini.
ROSE: where you been?
COSMO: i don't know, rose. i don't know where i've been, and i don't know where i'm going. you should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
MR. JOHNNY: i have my eyes open.
COSMO: you do, huh? stick around. don't go on any long trips.
MR. JOHNNY: i don't know what you mean.
COSMO: i know you don't. that's the point. i'll say no more.
MR. JOHNNY: you haven't said anything.
COSMO: and that's how much i'm saying.
ROSE: cosmo?
COSMO: what?
ROSE: i just want you to know. no matter what you do. you are going to die, just like everybody else.
COSMO: thank you, rose.
ROSE: you're welcome.
COSMO: i'm going to bed now.
MR. JOHNNY: i'm going.
COSMO'S VOICE: good!
ROSE: he doesn't like you. thank you for answering my question.
MR. JOHNNY: you don't know where loretta is?
ROSE: no idea.
MR. JOHNNY: then tell her i'll come by in the morning. we need to talk.
