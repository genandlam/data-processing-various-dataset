JOSEPH MILLER: this construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public! 
ANDREW BECKETT: my client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business, your honor!

JUDGE TATE: one at a time. mr. miller? 
JOE: your honor, since rockwell corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
ANDREW: your honor, i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. and the dust, which counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. each time it has been examined and the results...
ANDREW: limestone. messy, but innocuous.
JOE: innocuous?
ANDREW: defined by webster's as harmless.
JOE: i know what it means. your honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. the pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! and counselor calls it harmless?!
ANDREW: your honor, counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. but nothing could be further from the truth. rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers! granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society. judge tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.
JUDGE TATE: let's not go off the deep end, gentlemen. i thought we were talking about some dust.

JOE: right. miller. 
ANDREW: client of yours?
JOE: funny.
JOE: excuse me..? sir? yo!

TYRONE: gonna have to start looking for veins in your feet, sweetheart. 
DR. GILLMAN: andy. can you stop at my office on your way out?
ANDREW: sure.

ANTHEA: ... up to tax, on fourteen, and get right back, i need you. 
ANDREW: just the dazzling paralegal i wanted to see.
ANTHEA: i know what that means, and the answer is no. i have a class tonight. exploit someone else. and since you've asked ...
KILLCOYNE: solid work on the rockwell situation, andy. top-notch.
ANDREW: thanks, kenneth. your exam!
ANTHEA: thank you. 98. i gotta go...
ANDREW: ninety-eight?! ninety-eight!
SHELBY: conference call's up. they just started the roll call. here's the settlement agreement, the red-lined copy's on your desk.
ANDREW: no. great. thanks, shelby. it's 6:30, go home.
ANDREW: rach.
RACHEL: i'm late, i have to pick up amy from her afterschool but i want to talk to you about that hansen thing.
ANDREW: catch me later, i'll be here. and tell amy, i love her painting, it's on my wall.

ANDREW: present. 
ANDREW: hi, mom. it's me.
ANDREW: i'm fine.
SARAH: what's dr. gillman say?
ANDREW: hold on, mom. there's no way my client will go along with that.
HARGREAVE: who's this?
ANDREW: andrew beckett. hi, karen. i'm sorry i interrupted...
SARAH: are you on one of those conference calls? i hate when you put me on hold.

ANDREW: ah hah! yes! rentworth v. pennsylvania... court of appeals affirms jury award of punitive damages for wrongful interference with prospective economic relations... a shadow falls across andrew. he ignores it. 
KENTON: look at this guy. he's an animal.
ANDREW: walter.
SEIDMAN: are we interrupting, andy?
ANDREW: in a word, bob...
SEIDMAN: charles is right behind me.
ANDREW: i was just about to take a break. good evening, charles.
WHEELER: andy? could you step into my office for a sec? i feel like firing someone tonight. andrew throws an arm over seidman's shoulder.
ANDREW: we're gonna miss you around here, bob...

SEIDMAN: andy's expressed a keen interest in the kronos inc. situation, charles. is that correct, andy? 
ANDREW: the fate of the participants interests me, yes sir.
KENTON: it's good to be king, hey charles?
WHEELER: kings are out of fashion. i'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant. it's an anti-trust action.
ANDREW: it is, and it isn't, charles. macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of kronos' spreadsheet program. if they're allowed to sell it, kronos will get undersold right out of business. for me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
WHEELER: bearing in mind that bill wright, the chairman of macrosystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would
ANDREW: i'd like to see kronos win.
ANDREW: because they deserve to, walter.
ANDREW: if macrosystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand americans will be out of work. moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of macrosystems is trying to pull.
SEIDMAN: andy, do you know who reps kronos inc.?
ANDREW: bailey, brackman.
WHEELER: get with the program, andy. as of this evening, about 8:05 this evening, right after the soup course... kronos incorporated is represented by wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown. or, more specifically, senior associate andrew beckett.
ANDREW: yes!
SEIDMAN: you'll have to get right on it, andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
ASSOCIATE LAWYER: tokyo on four, bob.
SEIDMAN: great. excuse me, fellas. connichiwa. itsumo osewa ni nari mashita. arigato gozaimasu.
ANDREW: thanks, walter.
KENTON: what's that on your forehead, pal?
ANDREW: whacked with a racquetball. i appreciate your faith in my abilities.
WHEELER: faith, andy, is the belief in something for which we have no evidence. it doesn't apply to this situation. go home. i mean, get back to work.
ANDREW: thanks, charles.
WHEELER: no sweat, buddy.

CHANDRA: you want to apply the foundation as evenly as you can, andy. you don't want to look like you've thrown it on with a spoon. 
ANDREW: uh huh.
CHANDRA: okay. you try.
ANDREW: chandra? don't you think this color's a little... orange for me?
CHANDRA: tahitian bronze works best on lesions.
ALAN: think of it as the "i just back from aruba" look.
BRUNO: i got it.
ANDREW: thanks, bruno. i've been out of the office four days. i don't want them to think i've been to the beach. okay. check this out.
ANDREW: hides everything, right? what do you think?
CHANDRA: you know who you look like, andy? that actor, in that movie. not the one where he was autistic, the one where he dressed up like a lady on a soap opera...
ALAN: dustin hoffman.
ANDREW: tootsie!
BRUNO: right.
CHANDRA: you want to try light egyptian?
CHANDRA: what?
ANDREW: excuse me a sec...
CHANDRA: just like my cousin fredo.
BRUNO: you okay, andy?

ANDREW: thanks, you guys. 
MIGUEL: yeah. thanks, guys.
ANDREW: gillman's out of her office today.
ANDREW: aren't you giving an exam?
MIGUEL: i said, don't worry about it.
MIGUEL: you got a fever, baby.
ANDREW: i almost didn't make it to the bathroom, miguel. i almost lost control right in front of everybody.
MIGUEL: so what? it's nothing to be ashamed of. you have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
ANDREW: wait, here's my guy... hey!
INTERN: mr. beckett, i'm sorry...
ANDREW: about my blood work?
INTERN: we're waiting...
INTERN: ... meanwhile, i'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
ANDREW: sounds delightful.
MIGUEL: why do you need to do this?
INTERN: who are you?
MIGUEL: who are you? doctor... ?
ANDREW: this is my partner. we keep records of hospital visits.
INTERN: dr. klenstein. it's not a pleasant procedure, but if the ks is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
MIGUEL: it could be parasites, an infection...
ANDREW: a reaction to azt...
KLENSTEIN: that's possible, but.
MIGUEL: he's not going through some painful procedure until we've cancelled out everything else.
INTERN: i'm trying to help your "partner." you're not a member of his immediate family, i could have you removed from the er.
ANDREW: he's upset, he's sorry.
MIGUEL: don't apologize for me.
ANDREW: he's not sorry, okay, fine. why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? i'll work on getting a specimen, i'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. okay?
INTERN: allright. i'll get on the lab about the blood work.
MIGUEL: i'm sorry. the intern walks away. andrew's beeper beeps.
ANDREW: that's the third time. i better call the office. would you relax, please?
MIGUEL: i am relaxed.
JOE MILLER'S VOICE: "if you or someone you know..."
JOE: "... has been injured through the fault of others, you may be entitled to legal remedy...
ANDREW: shelby? it's me. jamey's been beeping me, i... okay, okay, calm down. put jamey on.

JAMEY: andy?! this is a disaster! we can't find your revisions on the kronos complaint! 
ANDREW: slow down, jamey, for christ's sake!
JAMEY: i went down to word processing to pick up the corrected copy, but
JAMEY: what did you file it under?
ANDREW: k-r-o-one.
ANDREW: jamey, i don't have to mention, do i, that we're up against a statute of limitations on this complaint which runs out in... seventy-five minutes.
JAMEY: it's not here, andy.
ANDREW: you go down to word processing and tell those they better come up with that complaint,
ANDREW: every problem has a solution...
MIGUEL: why are you getting dressed?
ANDREW: you're not going to like this. please try to smile...
ANDREW: thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and... i will be back. an hour, tops.
MIGUEL: you're going to the office?!
ANDREW: you're not smiling.
MIGUEL: you're leaving the hospital? you're going into the office looking like that? are you insane?
ANDREW: one hour!
MIGUEL: drew!
ANDREW: i promise!

SHELBY: i'm looking through the files but... 
ANDREW: call the messenger service, have someone standing by...
ANDREW: think. you brought the discs in, you transferred...
RACHEL: i thought i was supposed to be covering for you. andy, you look awful.
ANDREW: word processing lost my kronos complaint. which must be filed by five o'clock! if it's late, there's no case... every problem has a solution.
RACHEL: what can i do?
ANDREW: get down to word processing. help jamey look. she rushes out.
ANDREW: no.
ANDREW: no, goddammit!
ANDREW: bob? something's come up. with kronos. i don't want to upset charles, but... oh, bob, the complaint's due in forty minutes and i can't find it. no, you don't have to come... great. great. andrew rubs his eyes, this is a nightmare.
SEIDMAN: c'mon, andy, you didn't lose anything...
SEIDMAN: 
ANDREW: i don't know what to do, bob.
SEIDMAN: you'll never find it in the dark.
SEIDMAN: what in name... ?
ANDREW: bob...
SEIDMAN: what's wrong with your face?
ANDREW: what's wrong with my face? you want to know what's wrong with my face? i've got a skin condition. next question, bob? no more questions? fine. now can you help me find the complaint?
SEIDMAN: allright. calm down.
ANDREW: sorry...
SEIDMAN: what was the file name?
ANDREW: k-r-o-one.
SEIDMAN: maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. we'll try combinations of those letters...
ANDREW: you're right, i probably just misfiled...
KENTON: andy?
KENTON: some sort of problem?
ANDREW: yeah, walter. yeah. some sort of major problem.

DOCTOR: there she is, okay. you can relax now, lisa. 
JOE: you load the film... ? no, on this side... or this side?
LISA: give me the camera, joe.
JOE: thanks, hon. oh my
JOE: oh my oh my look at her... oh my

JOE: go to famous fourth street and buy a pound of nova. no! she likes scotch salmon better. ah heck, get a pound of both! get a dozen onion rolls. get some bagels. get a dozen. get a bottle of champagne. dom peringon... a hundred bucks a bottle?! better get a good california... 
JOE: give me a call. get everything over here as soon as you can, she's starved. no, not the baby! lisa! ... iris, listen: any calls i should know about? ... uh huh... uh huh... beckett? who's andrew beckett?
JOE'S MOTHER/AUNTS/UNCLES, ETC.: congratulations! how is lisa?!

MRS. FINLEY: right. 
JOE: why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
MRS. FINLEY: why should i?

ANDREW: thank you. 
JOE: explain this to me like i'm a six year old, okay? the entire street is clear except for one small area under construction, with a huge hole that is clearly marked and blocked off, and you decide you
JOE: of course you have a case! now, i want you to go with my assistant, iris, and fill out some forms. she'll tell you about our fee arrangement. mrs. finley? any back pain since the accident? dizziness?
MRS. FINLEY: now that you mention it...
JOE: tell iris all about it. take good care of mrs. finley, iris. beckett, come in.
JOE: christ, what happened to you?
ANDREW: i have aids.
JOE: whoa-oh! sorry, i...
ANDREW: it's okay. can i sit down?
JOE: uh, yeah.
JOE: go ahead.
ANDREW: new baby?
JOE: one week old.
ANDREW: congratulations.
JOE: little baby girl.
ANDREW: kids are great.
JOE: thanks, beckett. i'm real excited about it. what can i do for you?
ANDREW: i was fired by wyant wheeler. i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners.
JOE: you want to sue wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown?
ANDREW: correct. i'm seeking representation.
JOE: continue.
ANDREW: i misplaced an important complaint. that's their story.
JOE: how many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
ANDREW: nine.
JOE: continue.
ANDREW: i was diagnosed with aids eight months ago. during a bout of pneumonia. i recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. since i was doing so well on the azt, we decided against telling anyone about it.
JOE: we?
ANDREW: my lover and i.
JOE: your... lover?
ANDREW: miguel alvarez. we've lived together for nine years.
JOE: continue.
ANDREW: i dove back into work, everything was fine. until the lesions started...

ANDREW: the next morning, i was called to the office for a meeting with the managing partners. walking down that corridor was strange. felt like everyone was staring. 
ANDREW: makeup.

WHEELER: sit down, andy. 
WHEELER: thanks for coming in.
ANDREW: of course.
WHEELER: andy. before we begin, i'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
JOE: you're in trouble.
ANDREW: i know that, charles.
WHEELER: more than your friend. family.
JOE: big trouble.
ANDREW: charles, i must apologize again, for the kronos mishap. it was a scary few minutes around here. wow. but thank the complaint was found.
KENTON: this time. what about next time?
ANDREW: there won't be a next time, i guarantee it.
WHEELER: andy. it seems that something has come over you, lately: a kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... earth to andy. anybody home?
KENTON: helloooo...
KILLCOYNE: that's right, andy. the last four, five months you've seemed really out of it...
SEIDMAN: at least... different, somehow.
ANDREW: perhaps... you're right. i've certainly been busy. with the kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the saunders trial all falling at the same time...
KENTON: some people think you have an attitude problem, beckett.
ANDREW: really? who thinks that, sir?
WHEELER: i do.
ANDREW: i had no idea there was a concern in that area. hey: i'll get to work on it right away.
WHEELER: we've been talking it over, andy. your future that is... we feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
ANDREW: honesty is always best.
SEIDMAN: do you really think so, andy?
ANDREW: yes, bob, i do. excuse me? am i being fired?
WHEELER: let's put it this way, andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
JOE: in a word, yes.
WHEELER: we don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. but we wish you luck, andy, all the luck in the world.
WHEELER: and i hate to rush you out of here, but...
JOE: but he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
WHEELER: ... we've got a committee meeting.
ANDREW: excuse me, charles. with all due respect... this is... preposterous! it doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. pardon the lack of humility, but i've had the distinct impression i was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. and i feel that wasn't just my imagination. and i also think i deserve to know what's really going on here, charles.
KENTON: oh, you're right, beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
WHEELER: take it easy, walter.
ANDREW: if you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the kronos suit?
WHEELER: i hoped the challenge would improve your performance. you could say it was a carrot.
ANDREW: a carrot?!
JOE: i buy that.
ANDREW: as in, the vegetable?
SEIDMAN: andy, you nearly blew the case, for sake! that alone is inexcusable. it would have been catastrophic for us. put yourself in our shoes, andy. there's no coming back from an error like that, regardless of who you are! i'm sorry, andy.
ANDREW: uh huh... okay... i see...
WHEELER: good luck, andy.
ANDREW: who are you?
SECURITY GUARD: i'm here to you to your office so you can organize your belongings.

JOE: okay. explain to me like i'm a two year old, because there's an element to this i can't get through my thick head: didn't you have an obligation to inform your employer you had this dreaded, deadly, infectious disease? 
ANDREW: the law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
JOE: okay, okay... they discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. they're frightened for themselves, their families... maybe it's the angle. maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. and how do they explain your status to the client for chrissake?
ANDREW: joe, from the day i arrived to the day they fired me, i performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. and if they hadn't fired me, that's what i'd be doing today.
JOE: okay... they want you out. it's against the law to fire you for having aids, so they make you look like a up. which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
ANDREW: they sabotaged me.
JOE: i knew you were going to say that. i don't buy it, and i don't see a case.
ANDREW: look. i know i have a case. if you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
JOE: correct. i don't.
ANDREW: thanks for your time.
JOE: beckett? i'm sorry about... what's happened to you. it's a kick in the head.
ANDREW: don't send flowers, joe. i'm not dead yet.

IRIS: have a nice day. 
JOE: find out if armbruster can see me this afternoon.
FILKO: what the hell's wrong with him?

JOE: i'm not worried. what are you doing? 
DR. ARMBRUSTER: checking your blood pressure, relax.
JOE: i didn't have contact. what do you consider "contact?" we were sitting in the same room, three, four feet... what if you shake hands? wait. i know the answer. only sex, or sharing needles.
JOE: right.
DR. ARMBRUSTER: leave that.
JOE: yeah, but doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? so you tell me, today, there's no danger, and i go home, and i hold my baby, and six months from now i hear on the news: "whoops!
JOE: why are we going to do that?
DR. ARMBRUSTER: joe. i don't care a whit about your private life.
JOE: you want to give me an aids
DR. ARMBRUSTER: right.
JOE: it doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
DR. ARMBRUSTER: not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... even kissing someone with aids is safe. but it there's something in your past you're worried about...
JOE: thanks, doc, but i don't need an aids test. are you crazy? but thanks for the information. really.
JOE: in my past?
ARMBRUSTER: iv drug use.
DR. ARMBRUSTER: a homosexual encounter.
JOE: get real.
DR. ARMBRUSTER: unprotected with a prostitute.
JOE: uh.... no. not really.
DR. ARMBRUSTER: or unprotected with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.

JOE: not especially. 
LISA: how many gays do you know?
JOE: how many do you know?
LISA: lots.
JOE: who?
LISA: karen berman. aunt teresa. my cousin tommy who lives in rochester. eddie meyers from the office. joe cantwell, he's one of the partners. his lover, greg. stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
JOE: your aunt teresa is gay? that beautiful, sensuous woman is a...
JOE: since when?
LISA: probably since she was born.
JOE: allright. i admit it: i'm prejudiced. i don't want to work with a homosexual. you got me.
LISA: okay, joe...
JOE: i mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? i don't get it. don't they get confused? "is that mine? i thought it was yours." hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
LISA: fine, joe.
JOE: and the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and at the same time... i can't

LIBRARIAN: this is the supplement. you're right, there is a section on... ... hiv related discrimination. 
ANDREW: thank you.
LIBRARIAN: we have a private research room available.
ANDREW: i'm fine, thanks.
LIBRARIAN: wouldn't you be more comfortable in a research room?
ANDREW: no. but would it make you more comfortable?
LIBRARIAN: whatever, sir.
ANDREW: fine.
JOE: who'd you get?
ANDREW: what?
JOE: find a lawyer?
ANDREW: i'm a lawyer. how's your baby?
JOE: huh? oh. great. she's great.
ANDREW: what's her name?
JOE: rayisha.
ANDREW: rayisha. very nice. andrew focuses on his work. joe steps away.
JOE: how did they find out?
ANDREW: one of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
JOE: uh huh...
JOE: how do you get from one lawyer spotting a lesion, which could have been a bruise, to the partners deducing you had aids and basing a decision to terminate you on that conclusion?
ANDREW: good point.
ANDREW: the partner who spotted the lesion, walter kenton, used to work for benton, myers, in d.c. there's a paralegal there, maria torres. she's had lesions on and off for three years. she says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by aids.
JOE: they didn't fire her?
ANDREW: no. they didn't fire her.
JOE: so kenton connected the... lesion,
JOE: there is no relevant precedent.
ANDREW: arline decision. supreme court.
JOE: arline? andrew shoves the legal book toward joe.

WHEELER: julius! 
KENTON: dr. j.!
DR. J.: gentlemen... ladies... julius erving enters, greeted by the lawyers.
LAWYERS: how's it goin', doctor?/this is an honor!/etc ...
JOE: excuse me. charles wheeler?
JOE: summons. for you.
DR. J.: say. what's up, chuck?

WHEELER: ... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. 
WHEELER: what about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
SEIDMAN: charles...
WHEELER: what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? what is it, bob?!
SEIDMAN: let's settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
WHEELER: andrew brought aids into our offices, into our men's room. he brought aids to our annual family picnic.
KENTON: we ought to be suing him.
SEIDMAN: for christ's sake, where's your compassion?
KENTON: compassion? andy cocks, bob. he takes it up the ass. he's a pervert.
SEIDMAN: that's kind of... extreme, walt. andy's private life is none of our business.
WHEELER: bob. you're trying my patience. andrew beckett is making his private life our business. we gave him kronos. did he say, "i'm sick. i might not be able to see this through?"
SEIDMAN: he was doing a great job.
WHEELER: bob. i must ask you to shut the up. did andrew beckett say "i might not be able to serve our clients to the
SEIDMAN: a jury might decide that andy has a case.
WHEELER: wait a minute. the man was fired for incompetence, not because he has aids. you didn't know he was sick, did you, bob?
KENTON: holy did you, bob?
SEIDMAN: no. not really.

FILKO: charles wyant wheeler?! 
JOE: morning, filko.
COLLEAGUE: hey, it's the local chapter of the aclu!
FILKO: you're a republican, joe! you belong to the nra!
JOE: how many toilet stalls are there in the women's restroom on this floor, filko?
FILKO: how many... what?!
JOE: two. how many toilet stalls are there in the
JOE: low-life, sleazy scumbags. of course they want a postponement, i've got a client with a terminal disease. they're going to drag their heels every step of the way, the rotten bastards.
PAINTERS): is that spelled right?

JOE: i just wanted to tell you... 
JOE: ... we're trying to set a date for the prelim. hang in there.
WOMAN'S VOICE: i can heal myself.
ANDREW: i can heal myself.
WOMAN'S VOICE: i can heal myself.
ANDREW: i can heal myself.

MIGUEL: i was coming out of the gym today, and i ran into jimmy. do you know what he asked me? "what's it like knowing your boyfriend's going to die?" 
ANDREW: jerk... what did you say?
MIGUEL: i said, "everyone's going to die, jimmy. but drew's not going to die of aids. there's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it." miguel strokes andrew's hair.
ANDREW: you got that right, mikey... you still believe that, don't you?
MIGUEL: yes. i think it will be a simple solution. they'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. it'll neutralize the virus. it'll revitalize the immune system, and people with aids will become healthy again.

WHEELER: you're looking better, andy. how do you feel? 
ANDREW: fine, thanks, charles.
JUDGE GARNETT: charles, walter...
WHEELER: congratulations on the new grandson.
JUDGE GARNETT: thank you. we're very happy.
JUDGE GARNETT: attorney for the plaintiff?
JOE: joseph miller, your honor.
JUDGE GARNETT: i've seen your television commercials. "if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... it should say, "through the
JUDGE GARNETT: on behalf of the defendants?
BELINDA CONINE: belinda conine. of petersen, lehigh, monroe and smith.
JEROME GREEN: and jerome green.
DEXTER SMITH: dexter smith.
RALPH PETERSEN: ralph petersen.
JUDGE GARNETT: you're outnumbered four to one. whom do i address? i can't talk to four lawyers at once.
BELINDA: i'm chief litigator, your honor.
JUDGE GARNETT: fine. i've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves... there is nothing i hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other. if you look at the opinion polls, when mr. john q. citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them... where are the lawyers? somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers. if we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll fall lower on that list. and when people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. and when this society loses all respect for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our grandchildren will live like savages.
JOE: if it please your honor, we
JUDGE GARNETT: hold it, joe. he wants to come back to work, chuck.
WHEELER: that's impossible, your honor.
JUDGE GARNETT: that's impossible, joe.
BELINDA CONINE: if it please your honor, we're prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty-five thousand dollars.
JOE: your generosity overwhelms me, belinda, considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months ago.
JUDGE GARNETT: give me a break, joe. let's cut through these false attitudes. give them a figure. how much do you want?
ANDREW: i
JOE: based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune deficiency syndrome... we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
JUDGE GARNETT: very good, joe. now, belinda, i've got a figure over here, of one million, five. i...
JOE: one more thing, your honor...
ANDREW: any settlement agreement

JEROME GREEN: we have letters. 
JOE: why haven't you produced these letters?
JUDGE GARNETT: take it easy. what's the big deal, chuck? the boy wants a letter, to show to his mother, for her to keep after he's gone. why are you being hard- assed about this?
WHEELER: i wish i could exonerate you, andy.
ANDREW: you can save it for the jury, charles. i want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, i'm a bad lawyer. gentlemen. counselor.
WHEELER: don't do this, andy.
JOE: whoa, whoa... what do you expect them to say, you're alan dershowitz?
KENTON: a trial takes
KENTON: you'll be sorry, beckett.
WHEELER: andy, you don't want this.
JOE: with all due respect, your honor, my client chooses to pursue his constitutionally guaranteed right to a trial.

ANDREW: this is the house where i grew up. in downington, pennsylvania. see this... ? 
ANDREW: those are my cute little hand prints. and my brother's and my sister's.

ANDREW: today is my parents' fortieth wedding anniversary. 
ANDREW: this is the front door. i caught a finger in this door, once... this one. broke it. this is the hallway, my mother calls it a foyer...

ALEXIS: uncle andrew! 
ANDREW: this is my niece, alexis. say hello, alexis.
ALEXIS: mommy's pregnant again.
ANDREW: you heard it here first, folks. news as it happens.
JILL: hello, darlin'.
ANDREW: this is my sister, jill, the most fertile woman on the planet. she's married to reverend jim.
JILL: you feel thin. hello, miguel.
MIGUEL: hey, jill. nice to see you, sweetheart.
JILL: handsome devil. is he eating?
MIGUEL: we don't discuss his weight. do we?

ANDREW: and what will we find in... da duh da duh da duh... the kitchen! 
ANDREW: hi, mom. how do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
SARAH: ancient. how do you think i feel? put that thing down and give me a hug. andrew, stop! ... he still doesn't listen.
ANDREW: where's dad?
SARAH: he's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.

ANDREW: things might be said, at the trial, that... are not going to be easy for you to hear. things about me, about my private life. and i want to make sure it's okay with everybody. 
MATT: i appreciate you asking, andy, but really, it's your call.
ANDREW: what do you think, jill?
JILL: to be honest, i'm worried about mommy and daddy. they've had to go through so much already... and, we all know... there's going to be even worse things to deal with, eventually. i wonder if it's fair to put them through this.
ANDREW: mom?
SARAH: all i know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. but when they fired you... you were so devastated, andy... i don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. fight for your rights.
ANDREW: thanks, mom... dad?
BUD: supposedly, the lord doesn't give you more trouble than you can handle. but i'm having a hard time believing that these days.
BUD: andy, the way you've faced this whole thing, you and miguel, with so much courage... your mother and i have been so very impressed...
BUD: i can't imagine there is anything, that anyone could say, that would make us feel less proud of you.
ANDREW: thanks, dad. i love you guys. how about you, randy?
RANDY: hey. you're my kid brother, andy. that's the bottom line. i mean, what are those going to say? you're gay? i knew that when you were five years old.
MIGUEL: wait a minute... you're

ANDREW: i guess... i don't have time for that any more. 
SARAH: jim? will you lead us in a prayer?
REVEREND JIM: dear lord. sometimes it is difficult to remember to be grateful...

REVEREND JIM: to remember, in our times of sorrow and confusion, that we have you to turn to, and each other. bless and keep andrew and miguel, dear lord, deepen and strengthen their love as they face the struggles that lay ahead. bless and watch over all of us, fill us with your love, your light, and your peace, which passeth all understanding. 
EVERYONE: amen.

GUIDO: "after all the days of spring have flown..." 
MATT: hey, miguel, can you imagine any two people being together for forty years?
MIGUEL: yes. i can.
JOE: forget everything you've seen on tv, and in the movies...

JOE: you are presented with a simple fact: andrew beckett was fired. you will hear two explanations for why he was fired. ours. and theirs... 
AIDS...: joe pauses, letting that sink in.
JOE: point number four. they panicked. and, in their panic, they did what most of us would like to do with aids... get it, and the people who have it, as far away from us as possible.
JOE: the behavior of andrew beckett's employers may seem reasonable to you. it does to me. after all, aids is a deadly, incurable, disease...

BELINDA: fact. andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. fact. he made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... fact. he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. fact. andrew beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. fact. he was successful in his duplicity. the partners at wyant wheeler did 
BELINDA: fact. andrew beckett is dying.
BELINDA: fact. andrew beckett is angry. because his "lifestyle," his reckless behavior, has cut short his life... and in his anger, his rage, he's lashing out. and he wants someone to

JOE: andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct? 
LAIRD: wyant wheeler represented us.
JOE: but, andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
LAIRD: that's correct.
JOE: were you pleased with his work?
LAIRD: we were satisfied.
JOE: were you satisfied, or were you pleased?
LAIRD: we were satisfied.
JOE: mr. laird, when i approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition.
LAIRD: that's correct.
JOE: according to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of andrew beckett's work. do you remember saying that?
LAIRD: i may have said something like that. but that's not how i feel at this moment.
JOE: okay, mr. laird. explain this to me like i'm a four year old: did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
LAIRD: we won.
JOE: did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
LAIRD: it satisfied me.
JOE: it's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. do you agree?
LAIRD: i might.
JOE: five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. your standards have shifted a great deal, and i'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
LAIRD: since that time i've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how i feel now.

JEROME GREEN: partner robert seidman was the supervising attorney for your lawsuit? 
MR. LAIRD: that's right.
JEROME GREEN: does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during the trial?
MR. LAIRD: often, he does.
JEROME GREEN: as far as you know, in the handling of your lawsuit, andrew beckett was simply following orders.
LAIRD: that's a fair assessment of the situation.

ANDREW: i'm not political. i just want compensation for being fired. 
REPORTER MEDINA: but you are gay, aren't you?

FILKO: hell, no! joe "angela, we're standing in philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, the birthplace of freedom, where our founding fathers authored the declaration of independence. and i don't remember that glorious document saying "all 
FILKO: hey, joe. you're not starting to get a little... light on your feet here on us, are you?
JOE: yeah, filko. i am. i'm on the prowl, filko. i need a man. not just any man. i need a hunk. a hunk like you. how about it, filko? want to play sailor? this time, i'll be first mate and you can be columbus.
FILKO: chill out, joe.
JOE: those people make me sick, filko! but a law's been broken, okay? the
TV REPORTER MEDINA: "... now the public knows that your son has aids and he's gay. how does that make you feel?"
SARAH: "this is a world full of war, famine, poverty, homelessness... and people make a fuss because two men or two women want to live together, or make love. seems kind of silly, doesn't it?"

JOE: and walter kenton knew the lesions on your face and arms were caused by aids? 
MARIA: definitely. people were going around, whispering things. i figured i didn't have anything to lose, so i told all the partners.
JOE: how did walter kenton treat you, after you told him you had aids?
MARIA: every time he came into contact with me, he'd get this look on his face. i called it, the "oh god" expression. as in "oh here comes that woman with
AIDS.": andrew laughs.
JOE: ms. torres? have your employers fired you for having aids?
MARIA: no. when i need time off, for medical reasons, we work it out.
JOE: thank you. no more questions.
JEROME GREEN: miss torres. how did you contract the aids virus?
MARIA: during a transfusion. i lost a lot of blood giving birth to my second child.
JEROME GREEN: in other words, in

JOE: beyond noticing the marks on his face, were there other things about his appearance that made you suspect he had 
AIDS?: the witness: paralegal anthea burton.
ANTHEA: he was losing weight. he looked kind of tired sometimes. but he was working so hard... still, i felt something was wrong. and i can't believe
JUDGE GARNETT: just answer the question.
ANTHEA: sorry.
JOE: ms. burton. you're black.
ANTHEA: is that a question?
JOE: no. have you ever felt discriminated against, at wyant wheeler?
ANTHEA: yes.
JOE: in what way?
ANTHEA: well... one time, mr. wheeler's secretary, lydia, told me mr. wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
JOE: your earrings?
ANTHEA: apparently, mr. wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. she said he would like it if i wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "american."
JOE: what did you say?
ANTHEA: i said my earrings
BELINDA: miss burton? do you still work at wyant wheeler?
ANTHEA: yes.
BELINDA: were you recently promoted?
ANTHEA: yes. i'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
BELINDA: thank you.

JOE: good school. what year? 
YOUNG MAN: second.
JOE: great.
YOUNG MAN: would you like to have a drink with me? i just finished a game, i could use a beer. i don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
JOE: whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? you think
JOE: what's the matter with you? do i look gay to you?
YOUNG MAN: do i look gay to you? relax.
JOE: relax? i ought to kick your faggoty little for you!
YOUNG MAN: take it as a compliment. geesh. but joe is really upset. people are watching.
JOE: don't you know this is exactly the kind of that makes people hate you guys?
YOUNG MAN: you! you want to kick my ass? you want to try?
JOE: you're the asshole, buddy.
YOUNG MAN: get a life.

JOE: but what was it?! what was this guy thinking... ?! 
LISA: don't know, joe.
JOE: is there some kind of expression i've picked up from beckett?! some kind of fairy attitude i've unconsciously adopted?! am i walking different?! some kind of vocal thing?! have i picked up some kind of
JOE: very funny. i had a box of pampers under my arm for chrissake!

LISA: joe? 
JOE: yeah... ?
LISA: two men making love... ? now tell me again...
LISA: okay, so... help me with this one, joe... is it disgusting for someone to put his into someone's mouth? or, is it disgusting for someone to take a into

JAMEY: yes. we found a copy. it been incorrectly filed... 
JOE: has a file ever disappeared like that before? vanished into thin air, all of a sudden, only to reappear in the nick of time?
JAMEY: i've never known that to happen before. no.
JOE: did you have something to do with this file being lost accidentally-on-purpose?
BELINDA: objection!
JOE: i'll rephrase. did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
JAMEY: absolutely not.
JOE: are you a homosexual?
JAMEY: what?!
JOE: c'mon, mr. collins. are you homosexual? you know, gay?
JUDGE GARNETT: hold it, hold it!
BELINDA: objection! where has this come from?! suddenly counsel is attacking his own witness. mr. collins' sexual orientation has absolutely no relevance to this case.
JUDGE GARNETT: i said, hold it! mr. miller. could you kindly share with me exactly what's going on in your brain, because i don't have a clue at the moment.
JOE: your honor, everyone in this courtroom is thinking about sexual preference, sexual orientation, whatever you want to call it. they're looking at me, and wondering about it... they're looking at mr. beckett, and wondering about it. they're looking at mr. wheeler and wondering about it. they might even be looking at you and wondering about it. so, let's get it out in the open. let's talk about what this case is really about: the general public's hatred... our loathing, our

JUDGE GARNETT: in this courtroom, mr. miller, justice is blind. to matters of race, creed, color, religion. 
JOE: with all due respect, your honor... we don't live in this courtroom, do we?
JUDGE GARNETT: no. we don't... however, as regards this witness, i'm going to sustain the defense's objection.

ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR: everybody has a couple of gay friends. don't you? 
MARINE: no, sir. i do not.
ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR: you might have them, and just not know they're gay.
MARINE: i know.

JOE: and how many weeks at a time would you be out to sea, without stopping at port? 
KENTON: anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
JOE: any women on board?
KENTON: not when i was in the navy.
JOE: so during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal
JOE: like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
BELINDA: objection!
JUDGE GARNETT: mr. miller!
KENTON: we had one guy like that.
BELINDA: you haven't ruled on my objection, your honor.
JUDGE GARNETT: let's continue.
JOE: you had one guy "like that?"
KENTON: yeah. but we took care of him.
JOE: how did you do that?
KENTON: we stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
JOE: you taught him a lesson.
KENTON: yes, we did.
JOE: like firing andrew beckett taught
JOE: i'll withdraw. you were aware, when you worked with maria torres, that she had aids, correct?

KENTON: i 
KENTON: i felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.

MIGUEL: it's not going through. 
ANDREW: we'll have to flush it again.
MIGUEL: hold still. the vein's clotted. we have to go the hospital, so they can change the catheter.
ANDREW: i have too much work to do.
MIGUEL: we're not skipping this treatment.
ANDREW: i said, skip it, michael. it's my treatment.
MIGUEL: you.
ANDREW: you. this shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
MIGUEL: that shit's saving your life, you asshole!
ANDREW: what's wrong with you?
MIGUEL: close the law book.
ANDREW: i'm not going to close the--

MIGUEL: the least you can do is look at me, while i'm sticking this into your arm. forget the case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time. 
ANDREW: you don't think there's much time left, do you?
MIGUEL: that's not what i said.
ANDREW: you're scared. you think we're near the end.
MIGUEL: no.
ANDREW: maybe i should start making plans, is that what you think? start planning my memorial service? "begin to prepare for the inevitable."
MIGUEL: maybe you should think about it.
ANDREW: what's that mean?!
MIGUEL: maybe you should think about it.

ANDREW: i'm not going to die. 
MIGUEL: that's right. we're on the positive plan. you don't have a fatal disease, you have manageable illness.
ANDREW: you want me to give up? let this thing turn us into

ANDREW: i'm not ready to die. 
MIGUEL: do you think i'm ready for it?! i hate this i'm not a martyr! i hate every part of it!
MIGUEL: please don't leave me. i love you so much. don't die, don't leave me, please...
ANDREW: i am so scared. i am so fucking, incredibly, scared...
ANDREW: you know, there's only one thing to do. we have to have a party.
LISA: my lettuce is wilting.

JOE: we're friends of beckett's. 
ANDREW: it's me, you dork.
LISA: i'm lisa miller.
ANDREW: glad to finally meet you. come on in.

ANDREW: i have to introduce you to the can of soup. you can enter the costume contest together as a lunch special. 
ANDREW: this is lisa miller. miguel alvarez.
MIGUEL: my sister, maria. pastrami on rye?
LISA: corned beef.
MIGUEL: want to dance?
LISA: sure!
JOE: beckett. you seem... better.
ANDREW: i had a blood transfusion today. i feel great.
JOE: i'm a law suit.
ANDREW: not bad.
JOE: get it?
ANDREW: let's find you a drink.
ANDREW: what do you want?
JOE: beer. we need to go over your q and a.
ANDREW: excuse me, i'm having a party, is that allright with you?
JOE: sure. it's fine.
ANDREW: no, we have to do it. but later, allright?
JOE: thank you.
LA TOYA: 'scuse me, darling.
JOE: you think i'm uncomfortable...
ANDREW: correct.
JOE: you're right.
ANDREW: thank you.

MARIE ANTOINETTE: i'm an accountant. what do you do? 
JOE: i'm a lawyer. that's my wife!
SARAH: have a cocktail wienie.
JOE: thanks, sarah. nice costume.
POLICEMAN: it's not a costume, i just got off work. you're cute.
JOE: that's my wife. want to see a picture of my baby?

JOE: i'll see you in an hour, max. 
LISA: night, honey.
NUN/MARIE ANTOINETTE/LA TOYA: night, joe!

ANDREW: congratulations, miller. 
ANDREW: you survived your first gay party intact.
JOE: let me tell you something, okay? when you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where i was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. as a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
ANDREW: thank you for sharing that with me, joe.
JOE: let's review these notes for your testimony. we have a big day on monday.
JOE: when you refer to wheeler, call him charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
ANDREW: uh huh...
JOE: beckett?
ANDREW: charles. okay. miller?
JOE: what?
ANDREW: do you... pray?
JOE: yeah. sure.
JOE: then we establish how wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
ANDREW: what have you prayed for?
JOE: for a healthy baby. for lisa to make it through the delivery. for the phillies to get into the playoffs.
ANDREW: there's a possibility i won't be around for the end of this trial.
JOE: i've considered that.
ANDREW: what happens?
JOE: we proceed, representing your estate.
ANDREW: i've made provisions in my will for some charities. miguel will need a lawyer. i know it's not your area...
JOE: i know a good probate lawyer.
ANDREW: thanks. do you like opera?
JOE: opera?
ANDREW: want to hear my favorite aria?
JOE: opera?
ANDREW: andrea chenier, by giordano. this is madeleine. she's telling how, during the french revolution, a mob set fire to her house. her mother died, saving her. "i look... the place that cradled me was burning!" do you hear the heartache in her voice? then, here come the strings. everything changes. the music fills with hope. madeleine says...
ANDREW: "it was during that sorrow that love came to me! a voice filled with harmony that said... live still, i am life!" "i am the that descends from the heavens to the earth to make of the earth a heaven!" angle on joe: shifting, uncomfortable.
ANDREW: "i am oblivion! i am glory! i am love, love, love!" the music ends.
JOE: i think i'll... i told lisa.
ANDREW: right.
ANDREW: i'll look over the q and a.
JOE: you're ready, don't worry.

ANDREW: wyant wheeler had aggressively recruited me. they were the most prestigious firm in philadelphia, full of opportunity. and i was impressed by the partners. 
JOE: including charles wheeler?

JOE: what impressed you about him? 
ANDREW: he was... the kind of person i thought i wanted to be.
JOE: what kind of person is that?
ANDREW: possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. a razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street. the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. but underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
JOE: obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
ANDREW: it's possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time, but i wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
JOE: you didn't look then, the way you look now?
JOE: a regular all-american guy?
ANDREW: i suppose you could say that.
JOE: except... you were gay?
ANDREW: i still am.

JOE: in the years you worked at wyant wheeler, did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay? 
ANDREW: no. i didn't.
JOE: can you explain
ANDREW: i'm seeing him this afternoon.
FIRST MAN: what do you call a woman who has pms and esp at the same time?.
SECOND MAN: what?
FIRST MAN: a who knows everything.
CHARLES WHEELER: how does a fake an orgasm?
CHARLES WHEELER: he spits on your back.
SEIDMAN: charles, that's revolting!
JOE: how did that make you feel?
JOE: are you a good lawyer?
ANDREW: i'm an excellent lawyer.
JOE: what makes you an excellent lawyer?
ANDREW: i love the law. i know the law. i excel at practicing it. it's the only thing i've ever wanted to do.
JOE: what do you love about it?
ANDREW: well... many things. but i think the thing i love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. it's really quite a thrill when that happens.

BELINDA: you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." is that correct? 
ANDREW: something like that.
BELINDA: do you take risks?
ANDREW: in my work? yes. calculated risks. you have to.
BELINDA: in general. do you take risks in other areas of your life?
ANDREW: not unnecessary ones.
BELINDA: have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street?
ANDREW: a few times.

BELINDA: what kind of movies do they show there? 
ANDREW: gay movies.

BELINDA: gay 
BELINDA: do men have with each other in that theater?
ANDREW: yes.

ANDREW: andrew. 
ANDREW: now what do we do? robert laughs, closing the door of the booth.
ROBERT: i think we'll figure it out.

BELINDA: when? approximately what year did this event take place? 
ANDREW: i guess it was 1984, 85.
BELINDA: were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called aids, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
ANDREW: it's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv.
BELINDA: but you
BELINDA: you'd
ANDREW: no.
BELINDA: while you were employed at wyant wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
ANDREW: that is
ANDREW: no.
BELINDA: do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
BELINDA: as a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
ANDREW: in some situations.
BELINDA: isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
JOE: objection!
BELINDA: i'll withdraw it. mr. beckett? were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the theater?
ANDREW: yes.
BELINDA: you could have infected him, isn't that right?
ANDREW: miguel has not been infected. as i said, we weren't aware of aids, then, or how it is spread.
BELINDA: really?
ANDREW: yes.
BELINDA: you've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
ANDREW: that's right.
BELINDA: and it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you.
ANDREW: absolutely.
BELINDA: do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
ANDREW: one. here, in front of my ear.
BELINDA: remembering you are under oath, answering truthfully, can you see the lesion on your face, in this mirror, three feet away? answering truthfully.
ANDREW: by the time i was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
BELINDA: answer the question, please.
ANDREW: no. i can't really see it.
BELINDA: thank you.
JUDGE GARNETT: this would be a good time to break for the day...
JOE: your honor? may i have ten minutes in re-direct?
JUDGE GARNETT: beckett?
JUDGE GARNETT: can you go on for ten minutes?
ANDREW: yes sir.
JOE: i only need five! may i?
JOE: do you have any lesions on
JOE: if it please the court, i'd like to ask mr. beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an
JOE: your honor, if mr. beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? we're talking about aids, we're talking about lesions. let's

JOE: can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror? 
ANDREW: yes.
JOE: thank you.

SEIDMAN: i've discovered something interesting, charles. 
WHEELER: ... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy. what, bob?
SEIDMAN: no matter how hard i try, i can't lose a file in my computer.
SEIDMAN: the system automatically makes a backup.
BELINDA: i don't think i should hear this.
SEIDMAN: you can erase the backup... but
WHEELER: very interesting, bob. let's make a note of that. andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. he never put it in. he lied about that, too.
SEIDMAN: charles...
WHEELER: if you feel differently, bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. after all, this isn't a conspiracy.

BELINDA: why did you recruit andrew beckett to your firm? andrew uses all his strength to concentrate. 
WHEELER: if you're the owner of a major league ball club, you recruit the hot rookie. and andy was tremendously promising as a young attorney. that's why we went after him, that's why we hired him, and that's why we stuck with him, year after year... waiting for the promise to be fulfilled. but it never was.
BELINDA: you kept giving him another chance?
WHEELER: of course we did. when you've groomed someone they way we groomed andy, nurturing him, lavishing all kinds of special treatment on him... you've made quite an investment. we were waiting for his promise to kick in, and deliver. but, ultimately, we could no longer ignore the gap between the promise and the reality... this is one of the saddest times in my life. to sit in this court, testifying to andy's ultimate failure to make the grade. to discover that he is one of those people who wants to benefit by the system, but doesn't want to play by the system's rules. to think you
JUDGE GARNETT: mr. miller? joe rises. adjusts his jacket. wheeler waits.
JOE: explain to me, if you can, mr. wheeler, explain this to me like i'm a ten year-old. this trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying?
WHEELER: andy worked when he wanted to work, telling us what he thought we needed to know about his lifestyle...
RACHEL: i didn't mind covering for andy, but i did wonder... when was he planning to deal with his problem? andrew blinks... what's going on?
WHEELER: sometimes it seems like society is
WHEELER: people who want to bend the rules...
KILLCOYNE: if you want to be a leader in this society, you have to make certain sacrifices.
WHEELER: ... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.

KENTON: you have to make a decision: is this guy partner material? 
JOE: who makes the rules, mr. wheeler?

WHEELER: the everyday, common person with decent values... 
RACHEL: it seems like he wasn't willing to face the
WHEELER: ... but now, we're standing up for ourselves...
SEIDMAN: ... but we shouldn't have fired him...
WHEELER: ... it's time to get this society back on track!
ANDREW: could you call an ambulance, please?

MIGUEL: it's making it worse. take it out. take it out! 
LESBIAN JUROR: if he was "mediocre," why did they gave him this major assignment

SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR: they wanted to give him a final chance. 
POSTAL WORKER JUROR: makes sense.
BUSINESSMAN JUROR: i'd still love to know what happened to that missing file.
HOMEMAKER JUROR: wouldn't we all?
