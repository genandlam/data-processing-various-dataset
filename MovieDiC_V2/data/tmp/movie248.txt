GRUSINSKAYA: now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. i feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
GRUSINSKAYA: the peals are cold -- everything is cold -- finished -- it seems so far away -- so threadbare -- the russians -- st. petersburg -- the imperial court -- the grand duke sergei -- -- sergei -- dead -- grusinskaya -- it's all gone.
SUZETTE: mon dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
GRUSINSKAYA: the pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- i hate them!
SUZETTE: orchids come again, madam -- no card -- i think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. last night for instance --
GRUSINSKAYA: oh, suzette -- suzette -- sshh -- quiet.

GRUSINSKAYA: that theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- i was frantic -- i finished -- the last beat and... ...i waited -- i listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. a man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, pimenov. we are dead -- it's finished.
PIMENOV: meierheim --
MEIERHEIM: what is this that you have cancelled your car? who am i that i should wait like a fool at the door? and here on a whim, you cancel your car. have you forgotten there is a performance? do you know the time? or, are we all mad? am i your manager?... have we a contract? have we obligations? am i blind? ...or is that the time?
GRUSINSKAYA: i'm cancelling the engagement.

PIMENOV: if the house is empty again, i don't know --
MEIERHEIM: when she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. i know these people.
KRINGELEIN: you may laugh. caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. you see, i'm ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life. i don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
FLAEMMCHEN: you are funny. you speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
KRINGELEIN: yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. let's drink.
KRINGELEIN: i'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? velvet upholstery -- 'a-number one'. i'm in the textile trade and i know. and these are real silk drapes.
FLAEMMCHEN: silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
KRINGELEIN: have you seen the bathroom? -- hot and cold running water -- you see, i can get a bath whenever i like.

KRINGELEIN: do i know him -- i know him through and through.
BARON: i must -- i hope to see you again, mr. kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: you will stay, doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
DOCTOR: i have nothing better to do, mr. kringelein.

BARON: perhaps you could present me now, mr. pimenov. 
PIMENOV: please, baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is. grusinskaya sweeps into scene.
GRUSINSKAYA: my coat.
GRUSINSKAYA: suzette -- i told you not to bring the pearls. i will not wear them tonight.
MEIERHEIM: why not?
GRUSINSKAYA: take them back, suzette.
MEIERHEIM: you haven't time.
GRUSINSKAYA: hurry, suzette.
MEIERHEIM: such nonsense.

PREYSING'S ROOM: zinnowitz and preysing are standing by door. 
PREYSING: no news from manchester yet -- do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
ZINNOWITZ: good heavens no. that'd create the very worst impression. you must be optimistic. you must convince them. you know as well as i do that the merger must go through.
PREYSING: yes -- the merger must go through -- but i am used to making my deals on a solid basis. i am not a liar. i am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- i have a sense of honor -- i have nothing to conceal. i couldn't live happily otherwise.
ZINNOWITZ: well, don't get excited about it. we agreed that the merger with the saxonia people must go through.
PREYSING: i want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. i can't speak without notes. i like to have things down before me in black and white.
ZINNOWITZ: i'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. everything'll be all right, preysing... don't worry. goodnight.
PREYSING: good night.

FLAEMMCHEN: moreover...
PREYSING: moreover...
PREYSING: do you work in justice zinnowitz' office?
FLAEMMCHEN: no -- only occasional jobs.
PREYSING: tired?
FLAEMMCHEN: you pay me.
PREYSING: you're a very unusual stenographer --
FLAEMMCHEN: moreover...
PREYSING: moreover...
FLAEMMCHEN: i don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. i don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. personally, i hate offices -- i'd much rather be in the movies.
PREYSING: movies?
FLAEMMCHEN: yes, i photograph very well. look --
PREYSING: what is this?
FLAEMMCHEN: i got ten marks for that.
PREYSING: you...

PREYSING: a man? -- to switzerland? -- that must have been nice -- for him.
FLAEMMCHEN: only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
PREYSING: moreover... he was a lucky man -- that man.
FLAEMMCHEN: perhaps. he paces back and forth again.
PREYSING: don't misunderstand me. i'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. uh --
FLAEMMCHEN: moreover -- do you mind if i smoke? i went to florence once, too.
PREYSING: with the same friend?
FLAEMMCHEN: no.
PREYSING: moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the manchester cotton company...
FLAEMMCHEN: not too quickly.
PREYSING: what?
FLAEMMCHEN: you're a little too fast.
PREYSING: can't you understand me?
FLAEMMCHEN: i understand you perfectly.
PREYSING: have you got it now?
FLAEMMCHEN: cotton company --
PREYSING: should throw a great weight into the balance...
FLAEMMCHEN: ...weight into the balance...
PREYSING: come in.

BARON: no -- no -- no -- no...
CHAUFFEUR: why?
BARON: poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... i know -- i had it in the war. besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
CHAUFFEUR: you're no good for this business. it's just a joke to you...
BARON: i don't like your tone.

GRUSINSKAYA: nerves -- just nerves. you must forgive me. i have had a bad evening. i am very tired. do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
BARON: i'm afraid not -- i usually do just what i feel like doing at the moment.
GRUSINSKAYA: so you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... what now?
BARON: i'd like to smoke a cigarette.
GRUSINSKAYA: certainly.
GRUSINSKAYA: why do you look at me like that?
BARON: i did not know you were so beautiful... and --
GRUSINSKAYA: and then --?
BARON: no irony. you're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. i feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
GRUSINSKAYA: and -- and --
BARON: how tired you are!
GRUSINSKAYA: yes -- tired...
BARON: so alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: alone. all alone. oh, you strange -- strange creature.
BARON: you mustn't talk russian to me.
GRUSINSKAYA: strange man...
BARON: am i quite strange to you?
GRUSINSKAYA: not quite strange now. it is as if i had been expecting you. you know, once when the grand duke was alive, i found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
BARON: and...?
GRUSINSKAYA: he disappeared. later he was found dead.
BARON: i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: go away. who are you --?
BARON: a man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
GRUSINSKAYA: you could love me. it is so long since i have heard that word. nobody has loved me for a long time. it is so icy-cold to be famous. one is so cruelly alone. how is it that you -- let me look at you. your hands. your eyes. why could you love me?
BARON: i saw you just now -- then i saw you cry -- and now i see you in the mirror -- grusinskaya...
GRUSINSKAYA: grusinskaya... oh -- oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya -- for the success of grusinskaya -- for the triumph of grusinskaya... and what is she now? just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- are you listening to me -- do you understand? -- i want you to understand.
BARON: yes -- i do understand.
GRUSINSKAYA: i think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
BARON: i'm not going -- you know i'm not going -- let me stay here?
GRUSINSKAYA: i want to be alone.
BARON: that is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
GRUSINSKAYA: i want to be alone --
BARON: no -- you don't want to be alone at all -- you were in despair before -- if i left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, you must not be alone -- you mustn't cry -- you must forget... tell me that i can stay with you -- tell me.
GRUSINSKAYA: just for a minute then.
BARON: what? say it again -- i didn't hear.
GRUSINSKAYA: you -- man...
GRUSINSKAYA: thank you -- you are gallant. what a sentimental scene. grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing. it is many years since she did such a thing... you frightened me -- badly. you're responsible for this -- painful scene. he watches her.
GRUSINSKAYA: the stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. do you know what i mean? have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
BARON: i? -- oh, no. i do only what i take pleasure in doing.
GRUSINSKAYA: i see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. you take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. you take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... and what is your pleasure now?
BARON: i should like to smoke.
GRUSINSKAYA: why do you smile?
BARON: because i can see something in the mirror that you cannot. my dear --
GRUSINSKAYA: what can you see?
BARON: you are beautiful!
GRUSINSKAYA: no.
BARON: beautiful but so sad. i did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
GRUSINSKAYA: i think you had better go now. the key is on the floor.
BARON: i'm not going... you know that i'm not going... do you think i could leave you alone here? after that --?
GRUSINSKAYA: what?
BARON: the veronal -- you. i'm going to stay here with you.
GRUSINSKAYA: i want to be alone.
BARON: that is not the truth. you do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- i know you're afraid. i know you. you were desperate, just now, if i go away you'll be more desperate than ever. say i am to stay with you... say it. her head falls slowly on his breast.
GRUSINSKAYA: for just a minute then. no -- oh, no!
BARON: just for a minute, grusinskaya --

GERSTENKORN: oh -- now let's talk like adults. you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. when you first approached us...
PREYSING: we did not approach you.
WAITZ: letter on file september fourteenth would show that you approached...
PREYSING: it isn't so -- this was a response to a tentative feeler of your own.
GERSTENKORN: tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
PREYSING: scratched -- we did not take the initiative.
GERSTENKORN: of course you took the initiative.
ZINNOWITZ: good morning, gentlemen -- i see the conference is already underway.
PREYSING: oh, here you are, justice zinnowitz -- i'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?

GERSTENKORN: and i said we didn't.
WAITZ: and i know we didn't.

GRUSINSKAYA: oh -- i was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. we were drilled like little soldiers -- we danced in the school of the imperial ballet, in st. petersburg. i was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- no rest, no stopping. and then -- i became famous and whoever is famous is alone... but why should i be telling you this? last night i did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- i do not even know your name. 
BARON: i am felix benvenuto von gaigern. my mother called me flix.
GRUSINSKAYA: flix. -- and how do you live? what kind of a person are you?
BARON: i'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- i shall die on the gallows.
GRUSINSKAYA: really?
BARON: really, i haven't a bit of character. none at all.
GRUSINSKAYA: no?
BARON: when i was a little boy i was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, i learned to pray and lie -- and ---
GRUSINSKAYA: and?
BARON: and then, in the war, to kill and hide. that's all.
GRUSINSKAYA: and what do you do -- now?
BARON: i'm a gambler -- i'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, i really belong in jail
GRUSINSKAYA: oh! what a picture -- and what else?
BARON: i'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
GRUSINSKAYA: that's a silly joke.

ZINNOWITZ: ...and let me say again for the tenth time... ...you people were quite ready for the merger. you declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up? 
GERSTENKORN: i've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- what reason have we now? the preysing company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
PREYSING: evil days -- i've shown you here -- -- my company exports to the balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
GERSTENKORN: mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
PREYSING: what?
SCHWEIMANN: shall i tell them again?
GERSTENKORN: why waste time -- it's getting late.
SCHWEIMANN: you see -- what we are interested in --
GERSTENKORN: ah, come on -- we're going home.
ZINNOWITZ: mr. preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
GERSTENKORN: you've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.

PREYSING: why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. you've broken off negotiations. you did it. you're calling them off. you had nothing on your mind all day, but manchester, -- manchester -- manchester. you don't suppose for one moment that i'm such a fool as not to have something that i could say definitely about manchester.
GERSTENKORN: what?
PREYSING: oh no -- no -- the session is over. let's go, it's off. thank you, gentlemen.
GERSTENKORN: if you actually have news from manchester then...
PREYSING: gentlemen, i am now free to announce... ...that the deal between my firm and the manchester cotton company has been successfully negotiated.
GERSTENKORN: preysing, you're joking with us.
SCHWEIMANN: you're a deep one.

GERSTENKORN: in that case give us the articles. we'll sign at once. we know all the details... 
PREYSING: i thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
GERSTENKORN: under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
PREYSING: under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
GERSTENKORN: come on -- business is business -- come on -- preysing stands, looking ahead of him.
GERSTENKORN: here's my signature -- here preysing, sign here.

ZINNOWITZ: what's the matter with you?
PREYSING: bluff -- bluff -- all bluff.
ZINNOWITZ: what's bluff?
PREYSING: that.
ZINNOWITZ: 'deal with manchester definitely off! "preysing, oh -- i'd never have thought it of you.
PREYSING: no one would have thought it of me. i've been getting rusty in fredersdorf. well, if bluff is what the world wants i guess i can put up as big a bluff as anyone. from now on...
ZINNOWITZ: you must go to manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
PREYSING: yes -- i must go to england -- i was desperate -- now i don't care -- this sort of thing goes to a man's head.
ZINNOWITZ: what you need is some relaxation.
PREYSING: yes -- that's what i want -- i'd like to tear loose -- i'd like a drink. i'd like to go down to that dancing place. i'd like to start something.

BARMAN: a louisiana flip, sir?
KRINGELEIN: a louisiana flip, that sounds very nice -- sweet, eh? --
DOCTOR: what do you do in the grand hotel? eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do business -- flirt a little -- dance a little. a hundred doors to one hall and nobody knows anything about the person next to him. when you leave another takes your room and lies in your bed -- the end.
FLAEMMCHEN: good evening, mr. kringelein -- where's the baron?

BARON: no thanks -- keeping my head clear.
FLAEMMCHEN: dance then?

BARON: chasing around.
FLAEMMCHEN: chasing what?
BARON: money.
FLAEMMCHEN: you were very different yesterday.
BARON: yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.

DOCTOR: well, mr. kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for? 
KRINGELEIN: what, doctor?
DOCTOR: a masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
KRINGELEIN: i had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- i ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
DOCTOR: you must learn as quickly as your time allows -- believe me mr. kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
KRINGELEIN: haven't you anyone -- haven't you anybody -- you -- i mean -- are you all alone in the world.
DOCTOR: i'm always alone -- i have been everything.
KRINGELEIN: everything?
DOCTOR: i was sent as a military surgeon to south africa. stinking climate. taken prisoner. home on parole not to fight. i was a surgeon in the great war till the end. grenade in the face. carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. isolated two years. i've been everything.

FLAEMMCHEN: that was lovely. 
BARON: will you do me a big favor?
FLAEMMCHEN: i'll do anything for you.
BARON: would you like to make a man happy?
FLAEMMCHEN: yes -- i'd love to.
BARON: then dance the next number with kringelein.
FLAEMMCHEN: why?
BARON: i feel sorry for him.
FLAEMMCHEN: you're not a bit like you were yesterday.
BARON: i fell in love last night -- the real thing.
FLAEMMCHEN: oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
BARON: i thought that, too -- but i found that it does. come along, dance with kringelein.
FLAEMMCHEN: anything for you.
PREYSING: miss flaemm.
FLAEMMCHEN: hello!
PREYSING: i must speak with you, miss flaemm.
FLAEMMCHEN: presently, mr. preysing.
PREYSING: it's urgent.
BARON: pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
PREYSING: insolent -- berlin manners.
KRINGELEIN: i wish you a very good evening, mr. preysing. you are staying here, too, mr. preysing?
PREYSING: i don't know you.

FLAEMMCHEN: tomorrow morning.
PREYSING: no -- now.
FLAEMMCHEN: do you gentlemen know each other, mr. kringelein -- mr. preysing -- baron von gaigern.
PREYSING: mr. kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
KRINGELEIN: i could not think of not accepting.
PREYSING: you say that you are employed by us in fredersdorf, and here you are in berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- quite extraordinary, mr. kringelein, i think we will look into your books.
FLAEMMCHEN: now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. let's have our dance.
PREYSING: i'll remember you, mr. kringelein.
BARON: oh, let the poor devil alone.
PREYSING: i did not ask your advice.
BARON: i think it would be much better if you went away.
PREYSING: we shall see who remains here the longer.
BARON: as you will.

FLAEMMCHEN: you must look at my face and not at the floor. 
KRINGELEIN: yes.
FLAEMMCHEN: you're trembling.
KRINGELEIN: i never danced before -- in public.
FLAEMMCHEN: you dance splendidly.
KRINGELEIN: i'm happy, miss flaemm.
FLAEMMCHEN: really?
KRINGELEIN: for the first time in my life, i'm happy. kringelein shows signs of exhaustion.
FLAEMMCHEN: let's stop -- i'm tired.
KRINGELEIN: thank you, miss flaemm.
PREYSING: well now, miss flaemm, we can talk.
KRINGELEIN: some champagne, miss flaemm?
PREYSING: you may go, mr. kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: does the world belong to you, mr. preysing?
PREYSING: what is this insolence?
KRINGELEIN: do you think you have free license to be insulting? believe me you have not. you think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
PREYSING: go away -- go away.
FLAEMMCHEN: please -- please!
KRINGELEIN: you don't like to see me enjoying myself.
PREYSING: who are you? -- an embezzler most likely.
KRINGELEIN: an embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? you think i'm dirt, if i'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, mr. industrial magnate preysing.
PREYSING: you're discharged.
KRINGELEIN: me?
PREYSING: yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
KRINGELEIN: you can't discharge me -- i'm my own master now -- at last. i'm ill, i'm going to die -- do you understand? i'm going to die very soon. nothing can happen to me now. nobody can do anything any more to me. by the time you can have discharged me i shall have been dead already.
DOCTOR: come, mr. kringelein.
PREYSING: the man's insane -- he acts as if he is glad he is going to die... i shall see you in the lobby in half an hour.

HOUSE DETECTIVE: better let him stay -- i've sent for the baron... how's your wife coming along? 
SENF: i was at the hospital all night walking up and down the corridor. they wouldn't let me in to see her. she has the pains, but the child doesn't come and i have to stay here chained to this desk.
HOUSE DETECTIVE: it will be all right.
SENF: i hope so.
PREYSING: did you send that page?
SENF: the young lady's there, sir.
FLAEMMCHEN: oh, yes, mr. preysing?
PREYSING: sit here. cognac -- for you?
FLAEMMCHEN: nothing.
PREYSING: i'm going to keep an eye on that kringelein fellow. i'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the grand hotel.
FLAEMMCHEN: well -- you want me?
PREYSING: yes.
FLAEMMCHEN: well?
PREYSING: i must go to england -- at once.
FLAEMMCHEN: well?
PREYSING: you see, i'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- i'm nervous -- i need somebody -- i don't know if you quite understand me. you said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and i mean --
FLAEMMCHEN: i understand perfectly.
PREYSING: what do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
FLAEMMCHEN: wait -- i must figure it up. first, i'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in england in march, i'll need a suit... you'd want me to look nice?
PREYSING: of course -- of course.
FLAEMMCHEN: a thousand marks --
PREYSING: it's agreed -- i will get a room here for you.
PREYSING: i can get a room here in the grand hotel for you.
PREYSING: can you pay some attention to me?
FLAEMMCHEN: oh, yes.
PREYSING: insolent young cub!
FLAEMMCHEN: you mean baron von gaigern?
PREYSING: baron!
FLAEMMCHEN: well, he's a gentleman!

THE BARON: he slumps on the arm of the chair. 
KRINGELEIN: the baron is tired?
BARON: no, kringelein, not tired, -- just -- well -- well --
KRINGELEIN: perhaps this evening, baron, we could go to the casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
BARON: i'd like to kringelein, but i can't -- i am broke!
KRINGELEIN: broke -- a baron? but, baron -- the baron looks off, sees the chauffeur --

BARON AND CHAUFFEUR: moving into position. they are talking. 
BARON: i've quit.
CHAUFFEUR: you can't.
BARON: i'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
CHAUFFEUR: what about the money?
BARON: i'll pay you back.
CHAUFFEUR: how?
BARON: i have an idea working in my head...
CHAUFFEUR: you might find a bullet through that head...
BARON: if you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. if you wait -- i'll give you your six thousand back -- at that moment a voice is heard.
VOICE: madam grusinskaya's car -- madam grusinskaya's car.
INSIDE PORTER: madam grusinskaya's car --
MEGAPHONE: madam grusinskaya's car --

GRUSINSKAYA: i'm worried about you.
BARON: don't.
GRUSINSKAYA: on the train?
BARON: yes -- i will be on the train.
GRUSINSKAYA: till then.
BARON: bless you --
KRINGELEIN: was the baron joking, or is it really true that the baron is -- in financial straits.
BARON: absolutely true, kringelein and i have to raise some money immediately.
KRINGELEIN: if the baron -- if you would permit me -- the baron looks at him suddenly.
BARON: what?
KRINGELEIN: i would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. three hundred?
BARON: if i could get into a game i might win some.
KRINGELEIN: gambling! i'd like that. i have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
BARON: if we could scare up some men to play.
KRINGELEIN: we could come to my room.
BARON: good!
BARON: going?
FLAEMMCHEN: yes --
BARON: ready, kringelein?
KRINGELEIN: ready, baron.

BARON'S VOICE: all right, gentlemen. 
VOICES: i play -- i play -- here -- up -- playing --
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE: yes -- me.
KRINGELEIN: is that too much, baron?
BARON: no -- not at all.
KRINGELEIN: all right then.
BARON: all right then.
A MAN: don't show them.
KRINGELEIN: what do i do now?
A MAN: turn 'em up.
KRINGELEIN: oh yes -- that's right -- look! i win, don't i -- the baron rises.
BARON: there you are gentlemen.
A MAN: will you take the bank, sir?
KRINGELEIN: yes -- i'll take everything gentlemen -- please, let us drink -- champagne --- champagne is expensive and good. i'm winning more than i used to earn in a year -- double what i used to earn. they hand him the cards.
KRINGELEIN: where is the baron -- where are you, baron?
KRINGELEIN: excuse me, gentlemen.
DOCTOR: i'll take the bank -- all right, gentlemen.
BARON: that was my last.
KRINGELEIN: you've lost everything?
BARON: i've no luck.
KRINGELEIN: pardon me, baron. permit me again...
BARON: drink to me, kringelein -- it's my last chance.

KRINGELEIN: i'm having luck for the first time in my life.
A MAN: your bank, mr. kringelein.
DOCTOR: out, baron?
BARON: for a while -- i'll recover -- in ten or twenty years. look at that. he has pointed and turned off because we hear kringelein's voice:
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE: i've won again, baron -- i've won again.
KRINGELEIN: baron, i drink and win -- i drink and win -- i win and drink!
A MAN: there are complaints in the hotel about the noise.
VOICES: what time is it? getting late? let's break it up! you've been very lucky... where's my coat? let's go. he's drunk anyway!... goodnight, baron. let's wind up the game, i'm broke and tired; you can't play against him. i put my hat down here, somewhere. i think i'll have a drink before i go. by the way, i've got to see you tomorrow morning. how've you been, doctor?
KRINGELEIN: oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- stay a while. be my guests! by this time the men are pausing by the door.
KRINGELEIN: i oughtn't to presume, but i -- i'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. the first time in my life i have gambled -- i've danced! oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life i've ever tasted life!
A MAN: splendid!
KRINGELEIN: life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. you must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. you gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but i -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
A MAN: it's a short life and a gay one...
KRINGELEIN: every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it. baron, you know -- i've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- business ad lib.
MAN: drunk.
ANOTHER MAN: poor fellow.
VOICES: drunk? no, he's ill. looks ill. he's a doctor -- the doctor's here -- he's just drunk!
DOCTOR: gentlemen, this man is ill -- very ill -- if you will leave.
VOICES: certainly, doctor. goodnight! goodnight, baron! bad luck!
DRUNKEN MAN: he's not used to champagne -- why does he drink it? little comedy on exit. ad lib.
MAN: can i help, doctor?
DOCTOR: no, the baron will stay.
BARON: certainly.
DOCTOR: it will be over in a minute.
KRINGELEIN: over -- over so soon -- it has just begun. oh, the pain.
DOCTOR: try and sleep, kringelein, don't be afraid.
KRINGELEIN: i'd like to live a little longer but -- i'm not afraid to die -- i'm not...
BARON: you'll be all right, kringelein.
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE: my pocketbook... my money in it...
DOCTOR'S VOICE: what do you say -- what?
DOCTOR'S VOICE: you what -- oh, isn't it there?
KRINGELEIN'S VOICE: no -- but no i -- baron, i've lost my pocketbook.
DOCTOR: there is no pocketbook here... on the floor probably.
KRINGELEIN: more than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
DOCTOR: fourteen thousand marks... one can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, baron?
BARON: quite possibly.
KRINGELEIN: oh, i've got to find it.
DOCTOR: stay where you are.
KRINGELEIN: no -- i must find it -- fourteen thousand two hundred marks. the doctor goes to restrain him.
KRINGELEIN: i'm all right, doctor. there's no pain now -- only you don't know what that money means to a man like me.
DOCTOR: he must find his money, baron. mr. kringelein should find his pocketbook, baron, shouldn't he? these are two interjections.
BARON: here -- here it is. here's your pocketbook, kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, baron.
BARON: goodnight, kringelein.

DOCTOR: you've nothing to fear, kringelein

KRINGELEIN: oh, no, stay here, baron -- stay.
DOCTOR'S VOICE: goodnight, baron.
BARON: goodnight.

BARON: flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night. 
FLAEMMCHEN: looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
BARON: you live here?
FLAEMMCHEN: for tonight.
BARON: oh!
FLAEMMCHEN: yes -- oh!
BARON: well -- such is life, flaemmchen.
FLAEMMCHEN: and baron, thanks so much for everything.

PREYSING: flaemmchen! 
PREYSING: you are late. i've been waiting for you -- waiting.
FLAEMMCHEN: i had to arrange about the trip.
PREYSING: you're sweet.
FLAEMMCHEN: you think so?
PREYSING: come here.
FLAEMMCHEN: here, hold up!
FLAEMMCHEN: oh -- careful, mr. preysing.
PREYSING: call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
FLAEMMCHEN: oh, no.
PREYSING: why not?
FLAEMMCHEN: i couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
PREYSING: you're a funny little creature, flaemmchen. i can't make you out.
FLAEMMCHEN: it's not funny at all. one can't get intimate just off hand. i could go to england with you and everything like that -- supposing i met you next year and i said: 'how do you do, mr. preysing! and you said: 'that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester'.
FLAEMMCHEN: that's all quite proper. but supposing i met you when you were with your wife and i called out: "hello you big baby -- remember manchester?' and you with your wife, how would you like that?
PREYSING: please, flaemmchen -- we'll leave my wife out of this.
FLAEMMCHEN: all right. i'll get undressed -- get out.
PREYSING: aha! -- the baron. what do you want here?
BARON: i must have made a mistake.
PREYSING: made a mistake -- remarkable. we shall soon see if you made a mistake. stay here... give me that money.
PREYSING: so that's how we stand, baron.
BARON: look here, sir -- i'm completely at your mercy -- i'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- i had to get some money -- tonight.
PREYSING: indeed you must, baron -- you must. humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, baron, you're a thief.
BARON: be quiet.
PREYSING: i'm going to call the police. i'm going to watch you play the great baron with the police. aristocrat! aristocrat!
PREYSING: the door is locked, baron.
PREYSING: hello! hello! --
BARON: don't do that.
PREYSING: strike me, would you? attack me would you? attack me --
PREYSING: i'll strike you -- i'll strike you -- i'll strike you -- strike me!
PREYSING: i strike you --

PREYSING: where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
KRINGELEIN: her room -- oh -- i see, mr. preysing -- i understand, mr. general director preysing.
PREYSING: i can answer for this, it was self- defense -- i can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
KRINGELEIN: yes, i know them --
PREYSING: the scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. then you can travel -- i'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
KRINGELEIN: we must call the police, your excellency.
PREYSING: how much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.

SENF: no -- no -- not yet. well, i mustn't let it interfere with my duty. any news here?
CLERK: news? yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
SENF: what? -- who? -- whom?
CLERK: the big manufacturer killed baron von gaigern.
SENF: good heavens. what for?
CLERK: i don't know.
SENF: man -- that's terrible. he was a nice fellow -- i am sorry about him.
CLERK: it seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
SENF: i don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. i know people... i'm so tired i can hardly see out of my eyes. no sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. but it's too bad about the baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
CLERK: most imposters are --

KRINGELEIN: you loved the baron, didn't you?
FLAEMMCHEN: yes --
KRINGELEIN: so did i. he was friendly to me as no man ever was.
FLAEMMCHEN: perhaps he really was a burglar -- but they don't kill a man for that.
KRINGELEIN: he was in desperate straits. he'd been trying to raise money all day. he laughed -- poor devil! and then a man like preysing kills him.
FLAEMMCHEN: i didn't like preysing right off.
KRINGELEIN: then why did you have anything to do with him?
FLAEMMCHEN: money!
KRINGELEIN: yes, of course, -- money!
FLAEMMCHEN: you don't understand that do you?
KRINGELEIN: of course i do -- i never knew what money really meant till i started spending it. do you know -- i can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from preysing -- i'll take care of you. will -- will you let me?
