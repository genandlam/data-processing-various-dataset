FEMALE VOICE: careful . . . 
MALE VOICE: i know.
STONEY: not guaranteed, if used after 2198.
ADRIENNE: you thinking what i'm thinking?

ADRIENNE: what about kkinsa? 
STONEY: it's over between us. you're the only one for me!

FAT LOU: let's go! time to load up! 
YLLO: i'm missing two!
FAT LOU: temp's dropping! we should have left this rock an hour ago!
BOEMAN: north three clicks.

BOEMAN: there! 
KICKER: yo, teach, what the
YLLO: we're missing two of the kids!
KICKER: get your back to the shuttle. i'll check it out. kicker moves past the group and into the van.
YLLO: not without me!

YLLO: amazing! but, how . . i've been coming here for ten years. we never picked this up on our . . . kay-em? 
KAY-EM 14: the air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
THORGAN: somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
KAY-EM 14: in twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
KICKER: all right, all right, enough with the history
KKINSA: i have an idea, why don't you go find them and we'll get the out of here! kkinsa turns and finds herself face to face with - -

KAY-EM 14: was that out loud? 
DELONGPREE: thorgan, have you been with . . .
THORGAN: cool! this is an automatic "a".
AZRAEL: i've got my project. what are you losers gonna do?
KICKER: back to the shuttle! all of you!
YLLO: relax, soldier boy, this is amazing. these remains are two hundred years old.
BOEMAN: creepy.
THORGAN: cool.
KKINSA: okay, i'm outta here.
YYLO: kay-em, any thoughts?
KAY-EM 14: girth is better than length and women prefer a shaved during oral sex.
THORGAN: i'm trying to give her some personality.
YLLO: well stop messing with her. i don't want a science droid with a personality. now let's find them and get back. i want to
KKINSA: no way! i'm not staying here any longer . . . i have a life you know. a radio crackles.
FAT LOU: hey teach! this rock's starting to freeze! get your back hre!
BOEMAN: there was a hall of a battle down here.
COMPUTER VOICE: dan-danger. do not enter-er.
KKINSA: i feel compelled to ask why we are ignoring that.

DELONGPREE: damnit! 
YLLO: what the are you two doing?!
KKINSA: you're toast, mister.
YLLO: you're both toast!
ADRIENNE: you gotta see this!
THORGAN: that's a strange design, don't you think?
KICKER: we don't have time for this
CRYOGENICS LAB.: adrienne points to a small window in the door.
DELONGPREE: yeah, so? i had cryo 101 last year.
ADRIENNE: check it out.

KKINSA: so don't open the door. 
ADRIENNE: look beyond it, yesterday's news. yllo pushes his way to the window. shocked faces.
YLLO: is that?
KAY-EM 14: the room's still operational. she's perfectly preserved.
YLLO: fat lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. call grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
KICKER: now wait a minute! i don't think you should open that door.
YLLO: this is a science excursion corporal. just stay out of the way.
YLLO: okay, no around. this is the real thing. do exactly what i say. okay thorgan, open it up.
KKINSA: you're opening the door? what about the . . . ?
DELONGPREE: i'm thinking we should call in some experts.
YLLO: this is your find people. you want to give your credit away?
DELONGPREE: i was just saying . . .
THORGAN: the cryo unit leaked. the computers sealed the room. no airborne viruses no hazardous materials. i've shut down the until. alright, stand back.
KAY-EM 14: hold your breath. initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
DELONGPREE: knock you on your pal.

DELONGPREE: i speak on behalf of the group when i say . . . that's 
KAY-EM 14: female, nineteen years old, eight months . . . 34-26-34 . . . is built like a brick house.
YLLO: thorgan?!!!
THORGAN: sorry. i'll fix her when we get back.
KAY-EM 14: time of hibernation 2049. crystallization at seventeen percent. suggest extensive nanotech. chances of rejuvenation eight-one percent.
KKINSA: what's going on?
DELONGPREE: she's dying.
JANESSA: looks dead to me.
SERGEANT BRODSKI: yllo, sergeant brodski. get your back to the shuttle!!
YLLO: janessa, stretcher. keep your shirt on, sergeant. we have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime.
SERGEANT BRODSKI: kicker! get them the out of there!
KICKER: we're outta here!
YLLO: fine, grab that end.
THORGAN: hey check this out!
THORGAN: this caused the leak and there's an occupant.
KICKER: don't touch that!
KKINSA: this is bad, no?
THORGAN: relax, it's only a glitch in the system.
JANESSA: first field trip and you think you're a scientist. move out of the way geek. janessa moves to look inside the chamber.
DELONGPREE: used to make the suckers big didn't they?
KAY-EM 14: subject was dead prior to incubation.
YLLO: my look at him. why would they freeze a dead body? alright, load him up, and let's get out of here!

BACK INSIDE: one of boeman's gadgets starts to beep. 
BOEMAN: er, guy? i'm picking up some movement.
AZRAEL: cool . . . check out my arm.

YLLO: kicker! 
KICKER: defense droids. i'm on it.
KKINSA: there goes prom night.
KICKER: they're only class two. i can handle this. no problem.
AZRAEL: not a problem?!
AZRAEL: i'm missing a arm heeeerrrr- oh, that's dreamy.
JANESSA: okay rent-a-cop, do your
KICKER: stand back!
YLLO: we have to get these two back in one piece! kay-em turns to the frozen girl.
KAY-EM 14: subject is critical. needs nano stabilization immediately.
YLLO: kicker! do something!
ADRIENNE: oh gawd! i wish it would stop doing that.
AZRAEL: that is soooo cool! kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

KKINSA: have i told you guys how much i hate this class? 
KICKER: we need another exit! i'll hold 'em off! teach, find a way out!
BOEMAN: i'm on it!
KICKER: sorry kid, leave this to the pros.
BOEMAN: left at the end of the hall!
THORGAN: they're not after us. their sensors are locked in on . . . him!
KICKER: leave him behind!
YLLO: no! he's coming with us!
BOEMAN: here. we're one meter from the surface!
KICKER: then duck.
DELONGPREE: it's too high!
KICKER: make it happen!
JANESSA: they're just subclass b droids.
BOEMAN: stoney, you catch.
BOEMAN: we're clear! let's go!
KICKER: they've got me! let go!
BOEMAN: no!

BOEMAN: that wasn't so bad. 
KICKER: this will be! the others dive for the ground as - - kafoom! a fireball rises up out of the hole!
THORGAN: nice touch.
BOEMAN: and you said high school was boring.
FAT LOU: oh my . . . what the is . . .
YLLO: just get us to the ship!
AZRAEL: oh i forgot my arm!
ADRIENNE: here. dumbass.

BRODSKI: what the were you thinking? 
YLLO: get them in the lab!
BRODSKI: not so fast yllo! there's a protocol here. the e-x grunts step in front of kids.
YLLO: back off!
YLLO: get them to the labs . . . now!
YLLO: what the are you doing?
BRODSKI: my this is way over your head, pal. we need to call some experts and . . .
YLLO: i am an expert!
BRODSKI: you're a teacher.
YLLO: brodski i'll talk slow so you can understand me. she's thawing. if we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald head!
BRODSKI: what if they're carrying? did you even check?
KAY-EM 14: subjects scan virus clean . . .
KAY-EM 14: mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy? brodski and yllo look at thorgan.
BRODSKI AND YLLO: thorgan!!
THORGAN: sorry . . . i'll fix her . . . i promise.
BRODSKI: how do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal can't detect?

BRODSKI: damnit, yllo! i don't like it. 
YLLO: i don't give a this one's prime for decryonization. we're brining her back.
BRODSKI: i still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
YLLO: i am a scientist you asshole! this could be the most important discovery in 400 years. do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
BRODSKI: right now, i care only for the safety of this crew. you don't know anything about these two -
BRODSKI: what the is that?
YLLO: that's exactly what we need to find out. check your orders, sergeant. i out rank you where discovery is concerned. now step aside. i have a medical emergency to deal with.
AZRAEL: watch it punk, i'm armed.
DALLAS: punk?
AZRAEL: you'll pay for that.

BERNIE: gravitation nominal. thrusters engaged. 
FAT LOU: grendel to grendel's mother, we are enroute.

YLLO: get her prepped for the soup. take the other one to lab two. 
ADRIENNE: yllo, this is my find. my project.
YLLO: i know, dear, but this is too big a discovery. i need you to prep the second body.
ADRIENNE: but, i want . . .
YLLO: this is a discovery that we will all share. we have to work as a team. now go. stoney go with her.
THORGAN: have i told you guys how much i love this class?
DELONGPREE: she's beautiful . . .
THORGAN: talk about your hard nipples.
ADRIENNE: yllo! thinks he can push me aside. this is my find! she removes chucks of ice from jason's face.
STONEY: you know even though we both found this guy , i'll let you take the credits. you can take it from here.
ADRIENNE: oh thanks . . . fine go. it's just another dissection. you'll only get in my way.
STONEY: cool. besides, you're into this

YLLO: hands on training is rare. you should consider yourself lucky. 
AZRAEL: lucky?!
AZRAEL: another hour and i'd have lost the arm.
JANESSA: oh, was that the hand you beat off with?
AZRAEL: i better get extra credit for this
YLLO: delongpree, status. how you doing?
DELONGPREE: i'm okay.
STONEY: well she's definitely a blond.
JANESSA: oh that's scientific.
DELONGPREE: you think all girls from the past looked this good?
JANESSA: she's not that great.
THORGAN: 400 years . . . i bet she'll be horny.
YLLO: okay, people, we need to learn everything there is to learn about our two guests. and if all goes well, i'll mention each one of you when i make my nobel prize speech.
DELONGPREE: yeah, right.
THORGAN: everything looks good.
YLLO: turn up the heat.
ADRIENNE: done. crystallization remains seventeen percent.

COMPUTER VOICE: crystallization at sixty percent subject classification . . . deformity. 
ADRIENNE: put it on the screen.
ADRIENNE: guys, check out beef-cakes scan.
ADRIENNE: look at the brain.
JANESSA: it's just like thorgan's. what do you think this means?
THORGAN: this is what it means right here.
JANESSA: small brains make your itch?
DELONGPRE: and what's with the headgear?
KAY-EM 14: the mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
BOEMAN: hockey.
KAY-EM 14: a medieval sport where two teams club one another with elongated sticks. very sexy.
YLLO: what do you expect from a culture that sucked its planet dry of resources.
KKINSA: this bores me.
DELONGPRE: she's red. body temp 98.6. this is so cool.
YLLO: prep defib and start the cell reconstruction.
THORGAN: cool!
YLLO: is she stable?
KAY-EM 14: subject is stable and cell reconstruction has begun.
DELONGPRE: now what?
YLLO: we wait. i need about fifteen. call me if there are any changes.
AZRAEL: don't i deserve a sick day or some like that?

KKINSA: adrienne?! of all people! 
STONEY: you're jealous.
KKINSA: adrienne?!
STONEY: it's over between us. you're the one i want.
KKINSA: bed!

ADRIENNE: prepare organ vats. 
ADRIENNE: okay big boy . . .
ADRIENNE: . . . let's see what you're made of.

JANESSA: all this science makes me horny. take off your cloths, we don't have much time. 
JANESSA: you're quicker than usual.
YLLO: later.
JANESSA: you prefer an apple?
YLLO: secure line. perez, joshua, solaras space lab. connect.

PEREZ: you son of a you know what time it is? 
YLLO: we just left old earth. you'll never believe what we found. yllo inserts a disk into the console.
YLLO: i'm sending you the files.
PEREZ: yeah, yeah if this is another ancient farrari . . .
YLLO: trust me. i'm bypassing regular channels. see what kind of payday we're looking at.
PEREZ: alright, i'm . . . no way . . . is this a joke?

YLLO: hypothetically, how much are we talking? 
PEREZ: if you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. doesn't include touring and guest lectures. when can you get them here?
YLLO: i'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
PEREZ: see you then . . . doctor.

ADRIENNE: interesting. record. thawing has caused possible muscle spasms. 
KKINSA: yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

THORGAN: bye, lovebirds . . . stoney, you dog. 
BACK TO JASON: as he - -

YLLO: all right, lets do this. thorgan begin the defib program, delongpre, ready the drainage units. boerman get the others in here. 
BOEMAN: we've got a heartbeat!
KKINSA: no we've got a heart beat!
BOEMAN: stoney, you copy? she's awake.
STONEY: yeah i'm coming!
KKINSA: no . . . not yet!
BOEMAN: yes, right now!

YLLO: it's time. 
DELONGPRE: what about the others? shouldn't we wait?
YLLO: i've waited long enough. kay . . . you know what to do.
YLLO: what the are you doing?
BRODSKI: my job.
YLLO: fine, just stay out of my way. hit it.

RIZZO: hey! 
RIZZO: you son of a

COMPUTER VOICE: cryo-unit leak. lock down in progress. 
RIZZO: nooooooo!
RIZZO: somebody! no!

COMPUTER VOICE: subject in computer unit has reached full incubation. 
RIZZO: no . . .
A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.: -then passes out.

THORGAN: that one did it! 
YLLO: we should expect a moment of disorientation.
DELONGPRE: spunky . . .
YLLO: she broke my nose!
KAY-EM 14: again proving that your ancestors were savages.
BRODSKI: i like her already.

RIZZO: where..? who . . .? i'm alive. you brought me back. 
YLLO: obviously so.
RIZZO: what the is this
RIZZO: how did i get here, how did you bring me back?
YLLO: nanotechnology.
RIZZO: nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
YLLO: we've had nano-tech for the last 30 years.
RIZZO: 30? how long was i out?
YLLO: the year is 2455. you've been frozen for the past four hundred years.

THORGAN: the hockey player? he a friend of yours? 
RIZZO: hockey player? he's not a ...
THORGAN: he's dead! everyone's dead! old earth is dead!
RIZZO: old earth?
YLLO: we need to do some tests...i'd like to ask you a few questions.
RIZZO: but...i...400 years?
YLLO: that's right, now if you could...
DELONGPRE: it can wait. let's get you cleaned up.
YLLO: wait a minute...i need...
BRODSKI: give it a rest yllo. she needs some time.
DELONGPRE: come on.

DELONGPRE: rizzo? 
RIZZO: yeah?
DELONGPRE: i thought that after 400 hundred years,
DELONGPRE: you're on grendel, a class iv catamaran transport.
RIZZO: you're telling me i'm a friggen class project? delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.
DELONGPRE: sort of. i mean, no, not really ...
DELONGPRE: i'll give you a moment alone. do you want me to come get you when we start the dissection?
YLLO: well?
DELONGPRE: she needs a little time.
YLLO: more time...shit, she's had 400 years... yllo laughs at his own joke.
DELONGPRE: that's really funny.
YLLO: i'd want her statements before we reach porch. women.
DELONGPRE: yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
RIZZO: dissection?
RIZZO: jason? he's on this ship?!
YLLO: of course he is. he's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. look if you're worried about pr don't be. you're walking and talking. he's a stiff. you'll get the publicity.
RIZZO: are you finished?
YLLO: damnit! will you stop doing that?!
DELONGPRE: oh i like her a lot.
BRODSKI: i'm with you kid.
RIZZO: where is he?
BRODSKI: lab two, relax. what's the matter?
RIZZO: no, you're dead! you're all dead!

YLLO:  
JANESSA: oh my adrienne?
THORGAN: what have you done?
RIZZO: what have i done?! idiots.
BOEMAN: brodski! get to lab two. we have an emergency!
DELONGPRE: er, guys. where's the hockey player?
RIZZO: i'll tell you where he is. he's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
JANESSA: maybe she tripped.
BRODSKI: 
KICKER: oh man, what the happened?
RIZZO: jason! can't you see? he did this.
YLLO: impossible! he was dead before he entered
RIZZO: i didn't say he was alive.

DALLAS: that's nine to four, geek-boy. 
AZRAEL: you got lucky.
DALLAS: you got lucky. i could have waited until he ate your head.
AZRAEL: speaking of which, duck!
AZRAEL: what the?!

DALLAS: he's good. 
DALLAS: that why won't he go down?
AZRAEL: pause play.
DALLAS: he's not part of the program.
AZRAEL: hey cool. they brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
AZRAEL: hey! we're playing a game here. get off the court!
DALLAS: no, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...
AZRAEL: that does not count as a kill.
DALLAS: yes it does.
AZRAEL: oh, come on!
DALLAS: okay, enough of this
AZRAEL: alright,
AZRAEL: clear off the court,

DALLAS: i don't have all day, kid. 
AZRAEL: yeah yeah i better call the labs, see what the is going on.
AZRAEL: lab...this is az in the game grid.

YLLO: azrael can you repeat that? 
RIZZO: get him out of there!
AZRAEL: i said the guy in the mask is in here ruining our game.
AZRAEL: send someone to the grid to pick him up. he looks lost.
YLLO: that's impossible.
RIZZO: i told you! get them out of there! get out of there! get out of there now!
AZRAEL: all right fine, we'll head back-- suddenly, jason shoves his fist through the glass.
DALLAS: 
BRODSKI: dallas! that you? come back!
BRODSKI: dallas?! dallas?! do you copy?
RIZZO: he's dead. they're both dead. you don't understand what is on this ship. this is a being that kills. that's what he does. that's all he does. and he is very good at it.
BRODSKI: kicker, sven. get into the grid and tell me what the is going on! she gets up and heads for the door.
DELONGPRE: where are you going?
RIZZO: we have to get off this ship.
YLLO: that's ridiculous. you're overreacting.
RIZZO: why don't you get it? he's going to kill us all!
BRODSKI: i doubt that. i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

DELONGPRE: you just need to relax. rizzo ti's the future. 
RIZZO: i hope so.

KICKER: are they playing? 
SVEN: dallas?! azrael!

SVEN: oh 
SVEN: sarge, this is bad. the kid's his guts are ripped out.
BRODSKI: dead?
SVEN: oh yeah.
KICKER: sarge, this is kicker. dallas got it to. real slice and dice. what should we do?

SVEN: sorry! 
KICKER: don't friggen do that!
BRODSKI: yllo, what's your head count?
YLLO: looks like we're missing two.
JANESSA: you know, stoney's done everyone on this trip but me..what's up with that?
BRODSKI: this place should be safe. get them back here. i don't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident. as much as i've dreamed of doing that.
BRODSKI: i need to know what you know about this guy.
RIZZO: don't go out there. you can't win. we need to get off this ship. that's all there is to it.
BRODSKI: not an option. i'm going to hunt this son of a down.
BRODSKI: i've been a grunt for fifteen years. there's not a problem i can't fix with enough ammunition.
YLLO: stoney! stoney if you can hear me, get your down to the lab immediately! i'm going to see if i can find them.
KKINSA: sstoney's dead!

YLLO: all i'm saying is dock with space lab, couple of hours no more. let them take a look at our friends. 
BRODSKI: not a chance.
YLLO: just don't go in there half cocked. you guys have a tendency to blow up and ask questions later.
BRODSKI: you got that right.

BRODSKI: you sumbitch! three dead! on my watch! if that...that thing is out there, it's dead! you got it!!! 
KICKER: a...
BRODSKI: now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!

YLLO: that bastard! boemen turn on the tracking monitors. 
RIZZO: robot huh?
KAY-EM 14: kay-em 14.
RIZZO: barbie from hell...
KAY-EM 14: cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
RIZZO: yeah 3cpo, i saw star wars, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, barbie...
KAY-EM 14: i'm afraid i cannot assist.
RIZZO: i'm surrounded by idiots.
KAY-EM 14: you need to get laid!
THORGON: sorry, i'm working on it.
DELONGPRE: are all twenty-first century girls like you?
RIZZO: he'll kill us all. you know that, don't you?

THORGON: there's been an unauthorized entrance to the cargo bay. 
BRODSKI: got it! let's move out girls. yllo go to lab two and cover out backs.

BRODSKI: alright, the teach requests we take this guy out at the knees. i say shoot to kill. 
BRODSKI: so after you've killed him, put one in his knee so we can say we tried. the men laugh and high five.
BRODSKI: go to infrared, stay in radio contact. teach you there?

BRODSKI: you just keep an eye out. 
YLLO: yeah yeah. got it.

THORGAN: each blip represents a trained killer. it's men like that fought off the pirates on earth ii, battled jauntuns on the solar moons... 
RIZZO: so, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? they could hack him to pieces?
THORGAN: exactly.

KAY-EM 14: e-x grunt condor has flatlined. 
BOEMAN: sergeant, this is boemen...
BRODSKI: briggs, geko, talk to me!
BRIGGS: he was...he was right here!

BRODSKI: to hell! we're coming to you! 
THORGAN: you see that?
BOEMAN: briggs, geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.

BRIGGS: i don't see anything. 
BRIGGS: that's geko. maybe you kids should stay out of this.
BOEMAN: sergeant, you've lost two more men! int. cargo bay - portside

KICKER: sarge, what is this thing? 
BRODSKI: teach! where the are you?!

YLLO: fat lou, we're changing courses for the solaras space lab. 
FAT LOU: i'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
YLLO: we've got a situation here! just do as you're told!
FAT LOU: alright, relax. 20 minutes. soon as we've passed tara's rings we'll make the course correction.

YLLO: thank you. 
YLLO: ok sarge, what's your status?
BRODSKI: what's my status?! i've lost three men and your worthless after i kill this i'm coming your yllo!
YLLO: but i didn't see...

THORGAN: yes! 
RIZZO: listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
BOEMAN: duck fuckers?
RIZZO: he's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. okay, you know , that's it for me. i'm outta here.
DELONGPRE: outta here?
RIZZO: isn't there an escape pod on this ship?
THORGON: there's a shuttle.
RIZZO: alright, been nice knowing you.
KKINSA: i'll go.
BOEMEN: yllo said stay here.
KKINSA: yllo!
BOEMEN: they got him! you're not leaving!
SVEN: big sucker too.

RIZZO: do something!!! 
THORGON: don't look at me! i'm in high school!

YLLO: sergeant! 
BRODSKI: what?
YLLO: nothing.

RIZZO: lesson number one, kiddies. you wanna get home safely then we get off this boat. 
KKINSA: i don't understand...what does he want?
RIZZO: he wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship. rizzo looks at everyone.
RIZZO: any questions?
YLLO: you're not going anywhere.
RIZZO: you wanna die?
YLLO: are we locked down?
BOEMAN: that door's the only way in or out and it won't open without the code.
YLLO: then we wait. we're docking with space lab in less than an hour.
RIZZO: what good will that do?
YLLO: they can deal with this sort of thing.
RIZZO: more soldiers?
YLLO: scientists. very intellegent men.
RIZZO: that's great. i bet they'll kick jason's at a spelling bee!
JANESSA: look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
YLLO: try to calm down. just think, you're going to be famous!
RIZZO: guys, please come with me!
YLLO: 4you're not going anywhere.
DELONGPRE: now hold on! we should hear her out!
THORGAN: she's obviously dealt with this guy before.
YLLO: shut up! she just wants this thing dead!
DELONGPRE: no i got no problem with that.
THORGAN: maybe if we knew a little bit more about what we're delaing with here...
RIZZO: tnighty-night.
CRUTCH: leave her be.
RIZZO: ok, who do i gotta to get off this boat? thorgan timidly raises his hand.
RIZZO: listen to me. please. let's get off thsi ship. come with me.
THORGAN: rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? we'll die oout there.
RIZZO: how do you open the door?
YLLO: you're crazy!
DELONGPRE: rizzo, he's out there.
RIZZO: yeah and he'll be here soon enough. last chance.
RIZZO: fine. bye.
YLLO: pack your we'll disembark in an hour. the guys at space lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it.

YLLO: computer on line. 
JANESSA: what are you doing?
YLLO: can't you knock? diminish power to shutttle beowulf.
COMPUTER VOICE: power to beowulf disengaged.

FAT LOU: disengage auto-pilot. 
BERNIE: disengaged.
FAT LOU: new course, seven-eighty-one.

BERNIE: on course. eta 36 minutes, 34 seconds. 
FAT LOU: engage auto pilot.
BERNIE: en-en-en-en...eta-eta...

RIZZO: which way? 
KKINSA: what?
RIZZO: ssh.
RIZZO: he's in here.
RIZZO: you scream i'll snap your neck. got it?
KKINSA: how do you know?
RIZZO: i just know.

YLLO: we must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey. 
DELONGPRE: i'm thinking rizzo was right.
YLLO: thinking with your again, delongpre?
DELONGPRE: maybe we should go with them. like you said, your space lab connections can deal with this thing. at least we'll be safe.
YLLO: they are not going anywhere. i cut power to the shuttle. the kids and crutch stare at him. cold hearted.
RIZZO: open the doors.
KKINSA: something's wrong.
RIZZO: keep trying!

YLLO: everyone ready? 
YLLO: fat lou, what's the eta?

THORGAN: yuck. 
DELONGPRE: we're screwed.
YLLO: the ship doesn't need pilots to dock. we'll disembark and you'll see.
BOEMAN: uh...that's gonna be a problem. the ship's not on auto-pilot. we're flying blind. thirty minutes till impact.
YLLO: i guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.
THORGAN: but...

RIZZO: damnit, he's got them. 
KKINSA: rizzo, i think yllo must have done something. the door won't open.

YLLO: it's alright. he can't get in here! wham! wham!!! but the door is starting to give. 
KKINSA: the power's back up!
RIZZO: then open the doors!
KKINSA: thirty seconds.

JANESSA: what do we do?!! 
YLLO: crutch?
CRUTCH: help me up.
JANESSA: okay, i'm guessing you should hurry.
THORGAN: tell this i don't play hockey!
CRUTCH: okay!
YLLO: will that take us to the bridge?
CRUTCH: it's a maze up there, but yes.
YLLO: we'll engage auto-pilot! everything'll be fine! with that, the door gives!
KAY-EM 14: heart beat irregular...no blood flow... impossible...this....this... does not make sense.
YLLO: move it people!
BOEMAN: help me!
YLLO: now hold on! have you considered how valuable you are? credit, fame, you can have it all. and ladies. i mean, how long has it been?
YLLO: that's all you wanted?

YLLO: it's okay, he just wanted his machete. 
RIZZO: three...two...one...

KKINSA: rizzo, come on! 
THORGAN: go-go-go-go-go!!!!
DELONGPRE: he's right behind us!
RIZZO: close the door! i'll be right back.
KKINSA: what?!!
RIZZO: i gotta go back.
KKINSA: but?!!

KAY-EM 14: i'm quite sure i wasn't designed for this. crutch comes to a fork in the walkway. 
CRUTCH: okay, we need to ...
BOEMAN: you forgot didn't you, you old fart?
DELONGPRE: move it! he's coming!
DELONGPRE: go!
DELONGPRE: faster!

JANESSA: that was fun. 
KAY-EM 14: i got a brand new pair of roller-skates, you got a brand new key...
JANESSA: thorgan?!
THORGAN: i didn't do it. the fall scattered her programming..wait. where's?
THORGAN: hey, i think the fall killed him.
RIZZO: trust me, it's temporary.
BOEMAN: better let me.
THORGAN: where'd you get the gun? rizzo gestures at what's left of geko's body.
CRUTCH: the bridge is this way!
RIZZO: wait!
KAY-EM 14: there's not enough time.
RIZZO: forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
BOEMAN: what do you mean, not enough time?
KAY-EM 14: you know what you get if you shove two bananas up your ass? two covered bananas.
JANESSA: i think your metal lover's losing it.
KAY-EM 14: impact in ten minutes. it will take fifteen to reach the bridge. mamma's little baby love shortnin, shortnin, mamma's little baby love shotnin bread...

RIZZO: guys!!! the shuttle? 
RIZZO: idiots.
CRUTCH: this way!
THORGAN: i feel better. now how do you fire this thing?
DELONGPRE: just go! i've a feeling he's right behind us!
CRUTCH: just around this bend...
BOEMAN: nooooo!
BOEMAN: you'll hit crutch!
RIZZO: what are you doing? you can't save him!
RIZZO: don't just stand there! shoot him!
DELONGPRE: no you don't!

RIZZO: don't stop! 
RIZZO: you never stop when he's down!
RIZZO: shit!!!!
CRUTCH: forget him. come on.
BOEMAN: uh-oh.
JANESSA: what?!
BOEMAN: kkinsa! open the doors!
BOEMAN: kkinsa! he's coming! open the doors!
DELONGPRE: kkinsa, open the door!
RIZZO: yeah, that's it, scare the out of here, that'll work.
RIZZO: kkinsa, crutch is hurt! we need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

DELONGPRE: med-kit? 
RIZZO: i guessed.

RIZZO: we're going to be okay, kkinsa. 
KAY-EM 14: allow me. i'm trained in all aspects of the human psyche.
KAY-EM 14: kkinsa, dear, it is i, kay-em 14... open the door you silly
KAY-EM 14: i didn't say i was good at it.

SILENCE.: the smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble. 
THORGAN: did we get him?
DELONGPRE: we're screwed!
RIZZO: 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
RIZZO: just make a break for the door. he'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
BOEMAN: we're not leaving crutch!
RIZZO: we don't have time to argue!
JANESSA: okay, tell you what. you die, we'll run.

BOEMAN: everyone okay? 
THORGAN: i think i broke my arm.
KAY-EM 14: i seem to have misplaced mine.
JANESSA: you geeks wanna gimmie a hand?
DELONGPRE: we lost crutch.
BOEMAN: goodbye old friend.
RIZZO: okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
BOEMAN: could you show a little compassion?!
RIZZO: look, i'm sorry. i really am, but aren't you forgetting about ... suddenly a pile of rubble explodes. jason rises, his back to them.
DELONGPRE: back to the labs!

THORGAN: oh they turn as jason looms toward them, then -- 
EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT: cargo and debris. our heroes. jason.
JANESSA: this is just great.
KAY-EM 14: engage magnetics.

THORGAN: grab my hand! 
JANESSA: boeman, can you reach delongpre?

DELONGPRE: push off toward us. 
JANESSA: forget her, she's a pain in the ass. let her hang there.
THORGAN: i'm gonna spew.
JANESSA: that ought'a help the situation.
DELONGPRE: do it rizzo! we'll catch you.

RIZZO: what if you miss? 
DELONGPRE: what if we don't?

DELONGPRE: he's coming right at you! 
BOEMAN: grab my feet!
JANESSA: okay that hurt.
BOEMAN: thorgan, pull us in.
THORGAN: what now?
JANESSA: he's gonna send himself right at us. jason takes aim.

JANESSA: get off of me! 
THORGAN: you think it killed . . . yeah, i guess not.
JANESSA: let's just get out of here.
BOEMAN: the ship's in bad shape. back to the labs. let's check out status.

BOEMAN:  
THORGAN: the hull's imploding!
BOEMAN: rizzo! can you hear me?!

RIZZO: yeah. are you guys okay? 
BOEMAN: there's a red lever on the wall beside you. pull it!
RIZZO: it's locked!
BOEMAN: then break it! if you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
BOEMAN: hurry rizzo! you have to reverse the pressurization.
BOEMAN: what are you doing?!!
RIZZO: if the ship goes, so does jaso.
BOEMAN: rizzo pull the lever!
RIZZO: no.
DELONGPRE: rizzo?!
RIZZO: it's better this way. if we were rescued jason would just get off the ship. you want him on your precious earth ii?

THORGAN: hurry! she's lost it! 
JANESSA: so what else is new?

RIZZO: boeman don't. you know i'm right. 
JANESSA: are you crazy?! pull the lever! boeman yanks the lever.
COMPUTER VOICE: depressurization inconclusive.
KAY-EM 14: we've lost too much pressure. an hour, tops.
JANESSA: what's the point?
DELONGPRE: so that's it then. it seems it is.
RIZZO: what's that?
BOEMAN: that's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
KAY-EM 14: no... that's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
RIZZO: are there any other shuttles?
JANESSA: no.
RIZZO: teleportation? some way to beam us the out of dodge?
THORGAN: you read a lot of science fiction didn't you?
JANESSA: a little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
KAY-EM 14: i'll never experience my fantasy of
THORGAN: am i in there?
KAY-EM 14: sory...
RIZZO: hey.
DELONGPRE: that's a good fantasy, though.
RIZZO: hey!!
RIZZO: what's this?
DELONGPRE: it's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
RIZZO: can we get through these?
THORGAN: sure but what good will that do?
BOEMAN: when the left hull goes, so will the right.
RIZZO: what if we blow the walkways first? leave jason over here to go up with the ship?
JANESSA: you know, yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth millions.
RIZZO: any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
JANESSA: i'm just saying.
DELONGPRE: we'd need charges.
BOEMAN: we could convert fission transistors.
THORGAN: we're not supposed to do that.
BOEMAN: what are you gonna do, tell me?
DELONGPRE: the engine room will have molecular welders. we could seal up the hull.
JANESSA: yeah, great idea! and i'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
THORGAN: would you?
KAY-EM 14: now this is getting exciting.
DELONGPRE: remember to roll his around a bit.
RIZZO: you got a better plan?
BOEMAN: i'll need system four converters.
THORGAN: they're back here.
DELONGPRE: how many?
BOEMAN: bring 'em all. let's move!
THORGAN: hey! i'm not ready.
BOEMAN: then you better hurry. i'll blow alley one, delongpre, you and rizzo take there.
JANESSA: you're so bossy.
THORGAN: you're leaving me here alone?
DELONGPRE: don't blow your foot off.
KAY-EM 14: it's just you and me, then.
THORGAN: come here, might as well fix that arm.

DELONGPRE: see anything? 
DELONGPRE: i think i speak on behalf of the group when i say this is bad news.
BOEMAN: thorgan? you coming?!

THORGAN: almost done. 
KAY-EM 14: ow!
THORGAN: oh, hush. i disengaged your pain programming.
KAY-EM 14: sometimes i just wish i had a kitten.

DELONGPRE: put your finger here. 
DELONGPRE: my father wanted me to be a businessman. silence.
DELONGPRE: that's why i'm here.
RIZZO: so, you thought you'd be cool. go against your father's wishes? yeah, that's grown up. delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

RIZZO: i thought you meant... 
DELONGPRE: you thought i meant...too tough to apologize, huh? you must have been a very lonely girl. silence. neither speaks.

THORGAN: sorry, sorry. 
KAY-EM 14: who are you apologizing to?
THORGAN: good point.

RIZZO: when i was four, the ocean quit producing life. too many pollutants. nuclear testing, the occasional terrorist bombing...the atmosphere was by the time i was eight. we moved underground when i was twelve. 
RIZZO: my father was an army scientist. genetics. the army thought they could develop humans able to survive the earth we had created janessa moves through the debris.
ANOTHER POV: we see janessa come into view.
RIZZO: jason seemed to have the right stuff. physically, anyway. radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. he just kept going.

DELONGPRE: were you close to your father? 
THORGAN: delongpre? what did you do with the chain gun?
DELONGPRE: it's on the table where i left it! what the are you doing?!
THORGAN: i'm on my way.
BOEMAN: thorgan, quit around and come on!
THORGAN: i'm coming, i'm coming.
DELONGPRE: sorry, you were saying?

RIZZO: i got along great with my father, my mother too. dad and the others thought they could learn a great deal from this thing the army had been keeping on ice for over a hundred years. 
RIZZO: they were all wrong. they couldn't control him.

DELONGPRE: and what happend to ...? 
RIZZO: i couldn't save them.
DELONGPRE: well, we'd be dead without you. you know that, don't you?
DELONGPRE: it's true. you caused enough stink that we were at least a little cautious. of course this is the first field trip i went on that had a body count.
DELONGPRE: i'm not much, but i promise, i won't let this guy get you.

BRODSKI: where is everybody? what happened? 
JANESSA: damnit! you scared the out of me!
BRODSKI: give me a break! what happened?
JANESSA: jason. he's what happened. then grendel hit space lab.
BRODSKI: space lab?! wait'll i get my hands on yllo.
JANESSA: yllo's dead. we...we thought you were too.
BRODSKI: takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.

JANESSA: well go on! pass out! 
JANESSA: 
BRODSKI: he-help me...
BOEMAN: i'm blowing walkway one. hold on. ka-foom! the ship bucks!
DELONGPRE: we're blowing three. hang on.
BOEMAN: janessa, we're on our way to you!

BOEMAN: where is...? 
DELONGPRE: you tell me! she's only set one charge. and it's not finished!
BOEMAN: where have you been?!!
JANESSA: he....he...
DELONGPRE: he's coming!!!

BOEMAN: run!! 
RIZZO: we can't lead him into the other hull!
BOEMAN: we don't have a choice!

KAY-EM 14: do i have to? 
THORGAN: yes, i've reprogrammed you.
KAY-EM 14: oh, alright.

KAY-EM 14: come on, boy. let's see if we can open up can'a whoop ass! 
DELONGPRE: holy

BOEMAN: what are we waiting for?!! come on!! 
BOEMAN: where the were you?!!
JANESSA: he came for me, i had to run!
THORGAN: kay-em, you okay?

BOEMAN: toss me a chip. 
BOEMAN: thorgan, you're brilliant. have i told you that lately?
THORGAN: see you around.

BOEMAN: i'd say we have about ten minutes tops. 
DELONGPRE: then stop talking and work faster!

KAY-EM 14: she was a young and charming girl; her age was scarce sixteen. 
KAY-EM 14: she took me in and she kicked out a sailor and marine.
KAY-EM 14: she had no on her chest; that didn't bother me,

KAY-EM 14: for what she had between her legs was big enough for three. 
BOEMAN: okay, janessa, give me your last charge. janessa looks around, then --
JANESSA: i...i don't know what i did...
DELONGPRE: you lost the charge?
JANESSA: he was chasing me!
RIZZO: can we blow it with just two?
BOEMAN: if we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
DELONGPRE: then what do we do?!
BOEMAN: i don't know!

DELONGPRE: well, it was a good plan. 
BRODSKI: you stupid
BRODSKI: to hell, you left me back there to die!
BOEMAN: sergeant? we thought you were...
BRODSKI: yeah, yeah. well, what have you got to say for yourself?
JANESSA: i don't know...sorry?
RIZZO: sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
BRODSKI: bomb?
BOEMAN: explosive. we're blowing the walkway.
BRODSKI: how much you need?

KAY-EM 14: that was very good. you should feel very good about yourself right now. good effort. how could you hit a girl you sumbitch?! 
KAY-EM 14: okay, dip time to finish you off so i can go home and boink your momma with a corndog. the
JASON VOORHEES.: the top portion of jason's mask shatters!

KAY-EM 14: oh...my...god. what have i done? thorgan! 
KAY-EM 14: thorgan i'm a murderer!

BRODSKI: blowing the walkway? you come up with that yourself? 
BOEMAN: rizzo did.
THORGAN: kay-em!
BOEMAN: what are you doing back?!!
KAY-EM 14: sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
RIZZO: you killed him?
KAY-EM 14: blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. and look at me! i'm covered in his filthy blood!
THORGAN: you did good, kay-em. i'm proud of you.
KAY-EM 14: a real mamma's boy that one. dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. little good it did him.
RIZZO: his mother?
BOEMAN: what?
RIZZO: i don't know. nothing.
BOEMAN: hurry up people! we're running out of time.

THORGAN: as long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance. 
BOEMAN: two more charges to go.

THORGAN: done! 
BOEMAN: let's move out!
BRODSKI: kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?
DELONGPRE: i need another minute. come on!

BRODSKI: well me. 
KAY-EM 14: no, me.

THORGAN: kay-em? re-engage killer instinct. 
KAY-EM 14: yeeee-haw!!!!

BOEMAN:  
THORGAN: kay-em!!!
BOEMAN: done!!

THORGAN: kay-em! get away! 
KAY-EM 14: that's the best you can do?
KAY-EM 14: is that it? come back and fight like a man!

DELONGPRE: hurry! 
OUR HEROES: run toward the door. but, thorgan stops.
BOEMAN: what...?
BOEMAN: what are you doing?!!
KAY-EM 14: i think i'm going to throw up...
BUT IT'S TOO LATE.: jason raises his machete from his belt and --
RIZZO: hey,
RIZZO: go!
RIZZO: oh, yeah, you remember me. he sure does.

BOEMAN: hurry! 
DELONGPRE: faster! don't we have another gun?
JANESSA: they're not gonna make it. close the door before he gets us all.
DELONGPRE: they'll make it.
JANESSA: close the door!

DELONGPRE: damnit! 
DELONGPRE: forget it. i had to rewire it.

DELONGPRE: get ready to blow it. 
DELONGPRE: now!

BRODSKI: damage? 
BOEMAN: minimal.
RIZZO: we made it?
DELONGPRE: i think...i think maybe we did.
CHEERS: thorgan looks into kay-em 14's severed head.
THORGAN: kay-em we made it!
KAY-EM 14: oh, goody. i'm so pleased. i'd clap if i could.
BOEMAN: i've changed the course for earth ii.
VOICE: roger, grendel. what's the problem?
BOEMAN: our ship has been damaged, most of the crew dead. we need evac.
VOICE: copy that grendel. rescue enroute. you should hit earth ii orbit in fifteen minutes. rescue eta twenty minutes.

BOEMAN: we're going home people. more cheers. 
DELONGPRE: see? we're not so bad.
RIZZO: not so bad.

JANESSA: pull me in! 
BRODSKI: i'm pulling, damnit!

BRODSKI: we need weapons. 
RIZZO: weapons? all this technology and what good has it done?!
DELONGPRE: it bought us some time.
BOEMAN: and now we're all out of it.
BOEMAN: the ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. when it reaches the core, we're done.
RIZZO: done?
THORGAN: kaboom.
DELONGPRE: again?!
RIZZO: why am i not surprised?
KAY-EM 14: you must shut down the engines.
DELONGPRE: then do it. the rescue ship can find us here right?
BRODSKI: can't shut em' down from here.
BOEMAN: somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
DELONGPRE: you ain't catching my in there again.
BRODSKI: i'll go. the kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.
BOEMAN: you're too weak. i'll go.
RIZZO: you know, this future
DELONGPRE: you?
RIZZO: wait around on your all day. i'll need a distraction.
THORGAN: what kind of a distraction?

RIZZO: come on, keep up. 
RIZZO: you want some of me or not?
RIZZO: take your best shot --

RIZZO: i'm melting! i'm melting! 
RIZZO: see now that was stupid. persistent, yes, but stupid.
RIZZO: not this time, this time i'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

RIZZO: make it fast. he's coming. 
DELONGPRE: almost got it.

BOEMAN: hurry up, guys. we've got the rescue ship on radar. 
RIZZO: delongpre! out of time!
DELONPRE: got it!
DELONGPRE: that was close!

RIZZO: guys, he's right behind us! 
THORGAN: it's okay.
DELONGPRE: okay?!!
THORGAN: just come on, i've got an idea.

HIS POV: there's damage, lots of it. 
BOEMAN: the docking bay was damaged after the explosion. meet us at the airlock.
DELONGPRE: got it. you ever space walked?
RIZZO: oh sure, all the time.
BEHIND THEM: ka-fwam! jason barrels right through the door.
RIZZO: damit, thorgan, whatever you're doing... you'd better hurry! i hate the future!

THORGAN: don't worry. he can't see us. 
RIZZO: is that...?

DELONGPRE: earth ii. 
BOEMAN: suit up.
DELONGPRE: i'll help you in.
THORGAN: kay-em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?

KAY-EM 14: i get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but i get a kick out of you. 
THORGAN: goodbye, my love.
BOEMAN: thorgan, suit up.
THORGAN: this is gonna work. if he sticks to the program. will he? stick to the program?
RIZZO: his mother was killed before his eyes.
DELONGPRE: that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future
RIZZO: eat me.

MRS. VOORHEES: help me, jason, please! help your mother! jason moves closer. 
MRS. VOORHEES: don't let me die again!
JASON: pauses staring at the please for help.

THORGAN: oh, he's going to see us. 
DELONGPRE: well, do something!

THORGAN:  
BOEMAN: just a little more time.

BOEMAN: sergeant! 
BRODSKI: get out of here!
BRODSKI: that all you got?!!
RIZZO: he saved our lives.
DELONGPRE: boeman, the ships not here.
BOEMAN: use the thrusters and you'll be fine. we'll huddle together out there.

DELONGPRE: hey, easy now. 
DELONGPRE: you wanna release your air tanks?
RIZZO: okay, good tip.
DELONGPRE: you'll be fine.
BOEMAN: remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. we'll be fine.
RIZZO: why wouldn't we be. i mean, look around. so far so good.
DELONGPRE: don't worry. he can't get through that door.
BOEMAN: thrusters.
CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.: our group enters deep space.

DELONGPRE: rizzo, you okay? 
RIZZO: no i'm not okay! i don't know what the i'm doing!
DELONGPRE: you're doing fine. i won't let anything happen to you, remember?

THE DOOR PANEL: he preses the button 
KAY-EM 14: ahhhhh!

RIZZO: i think i had some when i was eight. 
DELONGPRE: did you like it?
RIZZO: i think so, why?
THORGAN: he's trying to ask you out on a date.
DELONGPRE: shut up, thorgan!
RIZZO: delongpre, you don't even know me.
DELONGPRE: i know you.
DELONGPRE: nooooooo!!

DELONGPRE: rizzo, pull away! 
RIZZO: i'm stuck!

AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.: rizzo takes a big gasp...coughs. 
DELONGPRE: you okay?!
RIZZO: oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
DELONGPRE: no thank you, you crazy old woman.
RIZZO: old woman?
DELONGPRE: well i mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
RIZZO: i get it.
KAY-EM 14: hello? a little assistance here?

THORGAN: kay-em you okay? 
KAY-EM 14: i am now. i missed you, thorgan.
THORGAN: i missed you too.
KAY-EM 14: i love you.

KID # 1: hey! check that out! 
KID # 2: a falling star!
KID # 3: it's a meteor
KID # 2: it's still cool.

KID # 4: it his the reservoir. 
KID # 1: let's go check it out!
