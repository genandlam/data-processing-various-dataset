speaker1: careful . . . 
speaker2: i know.
speaker3: not guaranteed, if used after 2198.
speaker4: you thinking what i'm thinking?

speaker1: what about kkinsa? 
speaker2: it's over between us. you're the only one for me!

speaker1: let's go! time to load up! 
speaker2: i'm missing two!
speaker1: temp's dropping! we should have left this rock an hour ago!
speaker3: north three clicks.

speaker1: there! 
speaker2: yo, teach, what the
speaker3: we're missing two of the kids!
speaker2: get your back to the shuttle. i'll check it out. kicker moves past the group and into the van.
speaker3: not without me!

speaker1: amazing! but, how . . i've been coming here for ten years. we never picked this up on our . . . kay-em? 
speaker2: the air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
speaker3: somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
speaker2: in twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
speaker4: all right, all right, enough with the history
speaker5: i have an idea, why don't you go find them and we'll get the out of here! kkinsa turns and finds herself face to face with - -

speaker1: was that out loud? 
speaker2: thorgan, have you been with . . .
speaker3: cool! this is an automatic "a".
speaker4: i've got my project. what are you losers gonna do?
speaker5: back to the shuttle! all of you!
speaker6: relax, soldier boy, this is amazing. these remains are two hundred years old.
speaker7: creepy.
speaker3: cool.
speaker8: okay, i'm outta here.
speaker9: kay-em, any thoughts?
speaker1: girth is better than length and women prefer a shaved during oral sex.
speaker3: i'm trying to give her some personality.
speaker6: well stop messing with her. i don't want a science droid with a personality. now let's find them and get back. i want to
speaker8: no way! i'm not staying here any longer . . . i have a life you know. a radio crackles.
speaker10: hey teach! this rock's starting to freeze! get your back hre!
speaker7: there was a hall of a battle down here.
speaker11: dan-danger. do not enter-er.
speaker8: i feel compelled to ask why we are ignoring that.

speaker1: damnit! 
speaker2: what the are you two doing?!
speaker3: you're toast, mister.
speaker2: you're both toast!
speaker4: you gotta see this!
speaker5: that's a strange design, don't you think?
speaker6: we don't have time for this
speaker7: adrienne points to a small window in the door.
speaker1: yeah, so? i had cryo 101 last year.
speaker4: check it out.

speaker1: so don't open the door. 
speaker2: look beyond it, yesterday's news. yllo pushes his way to the window. shocked faces.
speaker3: is that?
speaker4: the room's still operational. she's perfectly preserved.
speaker3: fat lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. call grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
speaker5: now wait a minute! i don't think you should open that door.
speaker3: this is a science excursion corporal. just stay out of the way.
speaker3: okay, no around. this is the real thing. do exactly what i say. okay thorgan, open it up.
speaker1: you're opening the door? what about the . . . ?
speaker6: i'm thinking we should call in some experts.
speaker3: this is your find people. you want to give your credit away?
speaker6: i was just saying . . .
speaker7: the cryo unit leaked. the computers sealed the room. no airborne viruses no hazardous materials. i've shut down the until. alright, stand back.
speaker4: hold your breath. initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
speaker6: knock you on your pal.

speaker1: i speak on behalf of the group when i say . . . that's 
speaker2: female, nineteen years old, eight months . . . 34-26-34 . . . is built like a brick house.
speaker3: thorgan?!!!
speaker4: sorry. i'll fix her when we get back.
speaker2: time of hibernation 2049. crystallization at seventeen percent. suggest extensive nanotech. chances of rejuvenation eight-one percent.
speaker5: what's going on?
speaker1: she's dying.
speaker6: looks dead to me.
speaker7: yllo, sergeant brodski. get your back to the shuttle!!
speaker3: janessa, stretcher. keep your shirt on, sergeant. we have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime.
speaker7: kicker! get them the out of there!
speaker8: we're outta here!
speaker3: fine, grab that end.
speaker4: hey check this out!
speaker4: this caused the leak and there's an occupant.
speaker8: don't touch that!
speaker5: this is bad, no?
speaker4: relax, it's only a glitch in the system.
speaker6: first field trip and you think you're a scientist. move out of the way geek. janessa moves to look inside the chamber.
speaker1: used to make the suckers big didn't they?
speaker2: subject was dead prior to incubation.
speaker3: my look at him. why would they freeze a dead body? alright, load him up, and let's get out of here!

speaker1: one of boeman's gadgets starts to beep. 
speaker2: er, guy? i'm picking up some movement.
speaker3: cool . . . check out my arm.

speaker1: kicker! 
speaker2: defense droids. i'm on it.
speaker3: there goes prom night.
speaker2: they're only class two. i can handle this. no problem.
speaker4: not a problem?!
speaker4: i'm missing a arm heeeerrrr- oh, that's dreamy.
speaker5: okay rent-a-cop, do your
speaker2: stand back!
speaker1: we have to get these two back in one piece! kay-em turns to the frozen girl.
speaker6: subject is critical. needs nano stabilization immediately.
speaker1: kicker! do something!
speaker7: oh gawd! i wish it would stop doing that.
speaker4: that is soooo cool! kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

speaker1: have i told you guys how much i hate this class? 
speaker2: we need another exit! i'll hold 'em off! teach, find a way out!
speaker3: i'm on it!
speaker2: sorry kid, leave this to the pros.
speaker3: left at the end of the hall!
speaker4: they're not after us. their sensors are locked in on . . . him!
speaker2: leave him behind!
speaker5: no! he's coming with us!
speaker3: here. we're one meter from the surface!
speaker2: then duck.
speaker6: it's too high!
speaker2: make it happen!
speaker7: they're just subclass b droids.
speaker3: stoney, you catch.
speaker3: we're clear! let's go!
speaker2: they've got me! let go!
speaker3: no!

speaker1: that wasn't so bad. 
speaker2: this will be! the others dive for the ground as - - kafoom! a fireball rises up out of the hole!
speaker3: nice touch.
speaker1: and you said high school was boring.
speaker4: oh my . . . what the is . . .
speaker5: just get us to the ship!
speaker6: oh i forgot my arm!
speaker7: here. dumbass.

speaker1: what the were you thinking? 
speaker2: get them in the lab!
speaker1: not so fast yllo! there's a protocol here. the e-x grunts step in front of kids.
speaker2: back off!
speaker2: get them to the labs . . . now!
speaker2: what the are you doing?
speaker1: my this is way over your head, pal. we need to call some experts and . . .
speaker2: i am an expert!
speaker1: you're a teacher.
speaker2: brodski i'll talk slow so you can understand me. she's thawing. if we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald head!
speaker1: what if they're carrying? did you even check?
speaker3: subjects scan virus clean . . .
speaker3: mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy? brodski and yllo look at thorgan.
speaker4: thorgan!!
speaker5: sorry . . . i'll fix her . . . i promise.
speaker1: how do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal can't detect?

speaker1: damnit, yllo! i don't like it. 
speaker2: i don't give a this one's prime for decryonization. we're brining her back.
speaker1: i still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
speaker2: i am a scientist you asshole! this could be the most important discovery in 400 years. do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
speaker1: right now, i care only for the safety of this crew. you don't know anything about these two -
speaker1: what the is that?
speaker2: that's exactly what we need to find out. check your orders, sergeant. i out rank you where discovery is concerned. now step aside. i have a medical emergency to deal with.
speaker3: watch it punk, i'm armed.
speaker4: punk?
speaker3: you'll pay for that.

speaker1: gravitation nominal. thrusters engaged. 
speaker2: grendel to grendel's mother, we are enroute.

speaker1: get her prepped for the soup. take the other one to lab two. 
speaker2: yllo, this is my find. my project.
speaker1: i know, dear, but this is too big a discovery. i need you to prep the second body.
speaker2: but, i want . . .
speaker1: this is a discovery that we will all share. we have to work as a team. now go. stoney go with her.
speaker3: have i told you guys how much i love this class?
speaker4: she's beautiful . . .
speaker3: talk about your hard nipples.
speaker2: yllo! thinks he can push me aside. this is my find! she removes chucks of ice from jason's face.
speaker5: you know even though we both found this guy , i'll let you take the credits. you can take it from here.
speaker2: oh thanks . . . fine go. it's just another dissection. you'll only get in my way.
speaker5: cool. besides, you're into this

speaker1: hands on training is rare. you should consider yourself lucky. 
speaker2: lucky?!
speaker2: another hour and i'd have lost the arm.
speaker3: oh, was that the hand you beat off with?
speaker2: i better get extra credit for this
speaker1: delongpree, status. how you doing?
speaker4: i'm okay.
speaker5: well she's definitely a blond.
speaker3: oh that's scientific.
speaker4: you think all girls from the past looked this good?
speaker3: she's not that great.
speaker6: 400 years . . . i bet she'll be horny.
speaker1: okay, people, we need to learn everything there is to learn about our two guests. and if all goes well, i'll mention each one of you when i make my nobel prize speech.
speaker4: yeah, right.
speaker6: everything looks good.
speaker1: turn up the heat.
speaker7: done. crystallization remains seventeen percent.

speaker1: crystallization at sixty percent subject classification . . . deformity. 
speaker2: put it on the screen.
speaker2: guys, check out beef-cakes scan.
speaker2: look at the brain.
speaker3: it's just like thorgan's. what do you think this means?
speaker4: this is what it means right here.
speaker3: small brains make your itch?
speaker5: and what's with the headgear?
speaker6: the mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
speaker7: hockey.
speaker6: a medieval sport where two teams club one another with elongated sticks. very sexy.
speaker8: what do you expect from a culture that sucked its planet dry of resources.
speaker9: this bores me.
speaker5: she's red. body temp 98.6. this is so cool.
speaker8: prep defib and start the cell reconstruction.
speaker4: cool!
speaker8: is she stable?
speaker6: subject is stable and cell reconstruction has begun.
speaker5: now what?
speaker8: we wait. i need about fifteen. call me if there are any changes.
speaker10: don't i deserve a sick day or some like that?

speaker1: adrienne?! of all people! 
speaker2: you're jealous.
speaker1: adrienne?!
speaker2: it's over between us. you're the one i want.
speaker1: bed!

speaker1: prepare organ vats. 
speaker1: okay big boy . . .
speaker1: . . . let's see what you're made of.

speaker1: all this science makes me horny. take off your cloths, we don't have much time. 
speaker1: you're quicker than usual.
speaker2: later.
speaker1: you prefer an apple?
speaker2: secure line. perez, joshua, solaras space lab. connect.

speaker1: you son of a you know what time it is? 
speaker2: we just left old earth. you'll never believe what we found. yllo inserts a disk into the console.
speaker2: i'm sending you the files.
speaker1: yeah, yeah if this is another ancient farrari . . .
speaker2: trust me. i'm bypassing regular channels. see what kind of payday we're looking at.
speaker1: alright, i'm . . . no way . . . is this a joke?

speaker1: hypothetically, how much are we talking? 
speaker2: if you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. doesn't include touring and guest lectures. when can you get them here?
speaker1: i'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
speaker2: see you then . . . doctor.

speaker1: interesting. record. thawing has caused possible muscle spasms. 
speaker2: yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

speaker1: bye, lovebirds . . . stoney, you dog. 
speaker2: as he - -

speaker1: all right, lets do this. thorgan begin the defib program, delongpre, ready the drainage units. boerman get the others in here. 
speaker2: we've got a heartbeat!
speaker3: no we've got a heart beat!
speaker2: stoney, you copy? she's awake.
speaker4: yeah i'm coming!
speaker3: no . . . not yet!
speaker2: yes, right now!

speaker1: it's time. 
speaker2: what about the others? shouldn't we wait?
speaker1: i've waited long enough. kay . . . you know what to do.
speaker1: what the are you doing?
speaker3: my job.
speaker1: fine, just stay out of my way. hit it.

speaker1: hey! 
speaker1: you son of a

speaker1: cryo-unit leak. lock down in progress. 
speaker2: nooooooo!
speaker2: somebody! no!

speaker1: subject in computer unit has reached full incubation. 
speaker2: no . . .
speaker3: -then passes out.

speaker1: that one did it! 
speaker2: we should expect a moment of disorientation.
speaker3: spunky . . .
speaker2: she broke my nose!
speaker4: again proving that your ancestors were savages.
speaker5: i like her already.

speaker1: where..? who . . .? i'm alive. you brought me back. 
speaker2: obviously so.
speaker1: what the is this
speaker1: how did i get here, how did you bring me back?
speaker2: nanotechnology.
speaker1: nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
speaker2: we've had nano-tech for the last 30 years.
speaker1: 30? how long was i out?
speaker2: the year is 2455. you've been frozen for the past four hundred years.

speaker1: the hockey player? he a friend of yours? 
speaker2: hockey player? he's not a ...
speaker1: he's dead! everyone's dead! old earth is dead!
speaker2: old earth?
speaker3: we need to do some tests...i'd like to ask you a few questions.
speaker2: but...i...400 years?
speaker3: that's right, now if you could...
speaker4: it can wait. let's get you cleaned up.
speaker3: wait a minute...i need...
speaker5: give it a rest yllo. she needs some time.
speaker4: come on.

speaker1: rizzo? 
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: i thought that after 400 hundred years,
speaker1: you're on grendel, a class iv catamaran transport.
speaker2: you're telling me i'm a friggen class project? delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.
speaker1: sort of. i mean, no, not really ...
speaker1: i'll give you a moment alone. do you want me to come get you when we start the dissection?
speaker3: well?
speaker1: she needs a little time.
speaker3: more time...shit, she's had 400 years... yllo laughs at his own joke.
speaker1: that's really funny.
speaker3: i'd want her statements before we reach porch. women.
speaker1: yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
speaker2: dissection?
speaker2: jason? he's on this ship?!
speaker3: of course he is. he's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. look if you're worried about pr don't be. you're walking and talking. he's a stiff. you'll get the publicity.
speaker2: are you finished?
speaker3: damnit! will you stop doing that?!
speaker1: oh i like her a lot.
speaker4: i'm with you kid.
speaker2: where is he?
speaker4: lab two, relax. what's the matter?
speaker2: no, you're dead! you're all dead!

speaker1:  
speaker2: oh my adrienne?
speaker3: what have you done?
speaker4: what have i done?! idiots.
speaker5: brodski! get to lab two. we have an emergency!
speaker6: er, guys. where's the hockey player?
speaker4: i'll tell you where he is. he's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
speaker2: maybe she tripped.
speaker7: 
speaker8: oh man, what the happened?
speaker4: jason! can't you see? he did this.
speaker1: impossible! he was dead before he entered
speaker4: i didn't say he was alive.

speaker1: that's nine to four, geek-boy. 
speaker2: you got lucky.
speaker1: you got lucky. i could have waited until he ate your head.
speaker2: speaking of which, duck!
speaker2: what the?!

speaker1: he's good. 
speaker1: that why won't he go down?
speaker2: pause play.
speaker1: he's not part of the program.
speaker2: hey cool. they brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
speaker2: hey! we're playing a game here. get off the court!
speaker1: no, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...
speaker2: that does not count as a kill.
speaker1: yes it does.
speaker2: oh, come on!
speaker1: okay, enough of this
speaker2: alright,
speaker2: clear off the court,

speaker1: i don't have all day, kid. 
speaker2: yeah yeah i better call the labs, see what the is going on.
speaker2: lab...this is az in the game grid.

speaker1: azrael can you repeat that? 
speaker2: get him out of there!
speaker3: i said the guy in the mask is in here ruining our game.
speaker3: send someone to the grid to pick him up. he looks lost.
speaker1: that's impossible.
speaker2: i told you! get them out of there! get out of there! get out of there now!
speaker3: all right fine, we'll head back-- suddenly, jason shoves his fist through the glass.
speaker4: 
speaker5: dallas! that you? come back!
speaker5: dallas?! dallas?! do you copy?
speaker2: he's dead. they're both dead. you don't understand what is on this ship. this is a being that kills. that's what he does. that's all he does. and he is very good at it.
speaker5: kicker, sven. get into the grid and tell me what the is going on! she gets up and heads for the door.
speaker6: where are you going?
speaker2: we have to get off this ship.
speaker1: that's ridiculous. you're overreacting.
speaker2: why don't you get it? he's going to kill us all!
speaker5: i doubt that. i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

speaker1: you just need to relax. rizzo ti's the future. 
speaker2: i hope so.

speaker1: are they playing? 
speaker2: dallas?! azrael!

speaker1: oh 
speaker1: sarge, this is bad. the kid's his guts are ripped out.
speaker2: dead?
speaker1: oh yeah.
speaker3: sarge, this is kicker. dallas got it to. real slice and dice. what should we do?

speaker1: sorry! 
speaker2: don't friggen do that!
speaker3: yllo, what's your head count?
speaker4: looks like we're missing two.
speaker5: you know, stoney's done everyone on this trip but me..what's up with that?
speaker3: this place should be safe. get them back here. i don't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident. as much as i've dreamed of doing that.
speaker3: i need to know what you know about this guy.
speaker6: don't go out there. you can't win. we need to get off this ship. that's all there is to it.
speaker3: not an option. i'm going to hunt this son of a down.
speaker3: i've been a grunt for fifteen years. there's not a problem i can't fix with enough ammunition.
speaker4: stoney! stoney if you can hear me, get your down to the lab immediately! i'm going to see if i can find them.
speaker7: sstoney's dead!

speaker1: all i'm saying is dock with space lab, couple of hours no more. let them take a look at our friends. 
speaker2: not a chance.
speaker1: just don't go in there half cocked. you guys have a tendency to blow up and ask questions later.
speaker2: you got that right.

speaker1: you sumbitch! three dead! on my watch! if that...that thing is out there, it's dead! you got it!!! 
speaker2: a...
speaker1: now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!

speaker1: that bastard! boemen turn on the tracking monitors. 
speaker2: robot huh?
speaker3: kay-em 14.
speaker2: barbie from hell...
speaker3: cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
speaker2: yeah 3cpo, i saw star wars, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, barbie...
speaker3: i'm afraid i cannot assist.
speaker2: i'm surrounded by idiots.
speaker3: you need to get laid!
speaker4: sorry, i'm working on it.
speaker5: are all twenty-first century girls like you?
speaker2: he'll kill us all. you know that, don't you?

speaker1: there's been an unauthorized entrance to the cargo bay. 
speaker2: got it! let's move out girls. yllo go to lab two and cover out backs.

speaker1: alright, the teach requests we take this guy out at the knees. i say shoot to kill. 
speaker1: so after you've killed him, put one in his knee so we can say we tried. the men laugh and high five.
speaker1: go to infrared, stay in radio contact. teach you there?

speaker1: you just keep an eye out. 
speaker2: yeah yeah. got it.

speaker1: each blip represents a trained killer. it's men like that fought off the pirates on earth ii, battled jauntuns on the solar moons... 
speaker2: so, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? they could hack him to pieces?
speaker1: exactly.

speaker1: e-x grunt condor has flatlined. 
speaker2: sergeant, this is boemen...
speaker3: briggs, geko, talk to me!
speaker4: he was...he was right here!

speaker1: to hell! we're coming to you! 
speaker2: you see that?
speaker3: briggs, geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.

speaker1: i don't see anything. 
speaker1: that's geko. maybe you kids should stay out of this.
speaker2: sergeant, you've lost two more men! int. cargo bay - portside

speaker1: sarge, what is this thing? 
speaker2: teach! where the are you?!

speaker1: fat lou, we're changing courses for the solaras space lab. 
speaker2: i'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
speaker1: we've got a situation here! just do as you're told!
speaker2: alright, relax. 20 minutes. soon as we've passed tara's rings we'll make the course correction.

speaker1: thank you. 
speaker1: ok sarge, what's your status?
speaker2: what's my status?! i've lost three men and your worthless after i kill this i'm coming your yllo!
speaker1: but i didn't see...

speaker1: yes! 
speaker2: listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
speaker3: duck fuckers?
speaker2: he's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. okay, you know , that's it for me. i'm outta here.
speaker4: outta here?
speaker2: isn't there an escape pod on this ship?
speaker5: there's a shuttle.
speaker2: alright, been nice knowing you.
speaker6: i'll go.
speaker7: yllo said stay here.
speaker6: yllo!
speaker7: they got him! you're not leaving!
speaker8: big sucker too.

speaker1: do something!!! 
speaker2: don't look at me! i'm in high school!

speaker1: sergeant! 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: nothing.

speaker1: lesson number one, kiddies. you wanna get home safely then we get off this boat. 
speaker2: i don't understand...what does he want?
speaker1: he wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship. rizzo looks at everyone.
speaker1: any questions?
speaker3: you're not going anywhere.
speaker1: you wanna die?
speaker3: are we locked down?
speaker4: that door's the only way in or out and it won't open without the code.
speaker3: then we wait. we're docking with space lab in less than an hour.
speaker1: what good will that do?
speaker3: they can deal with this sort of thing.
speaker1: more soldiers?
speaker3: scientists. very intellegent men.
speaker1: that's great. i bet they'll kick jason's at a spelling bee!
speaker5: look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
speaker3: try to calm down. just think, you're going to be famous!
speaker1: guys, please come with me!
speaker3: 4you're not going anywhere.
speaker6: now hold on! we should hear her out!
speaker7: she's obviously dealt with this guy before.
speaker3: shut up! she just wants this thing dead!
speaker6: no i got no problem with that.
speaker7: maybe if we knew a little bit more about what we're delaing with here...
speaker1: tnighty-night.
speaker8: leave her be.
speaker1: ok, who do i gotta to get off this boat? thorgan timidly raises his hand.
speaker1: listen to me. please. let's get off thsi ship. come with me.
speaker7: rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? we'll die oout there.
speaker1: how do you open the door?
speaker3: you're crazy!
speaker6: rizzo, he's out there.
speaker1: yeah and he'll be here soon enough. last chance.
speaker1: fine. bye.
speaker3: pack your we'll disembark in an hour. the guys at space lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it.

speaker1: computer on line. 
speaker2: what are you doing?
speaker1: can't you knock? diminish power to shutttle beowulf.
speaker3: power to beowulf disengaged.

speaker1: disengage auto-pilot. 
speaker2: disengaged.
speaker1: new course, seven-eighty-one.

speaker1: on course. eta 36 minutes, 34 seconds. 
speaker2: engage auto pilot.
speaker1: en-en-en-en...eta-eta...

speaker1: which way? 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: ssh.
speaker1: he's in here.
speaker1: you scream i'll snap your neck. got it?
speaker2: how do you know?
speaker1: i just know.

speaker1: we must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey. 
speaker2: i'm thinking rizzo was right.
speaker1: thinking with your again, delongpre?
speaker2: maybe we should go with them. like you said, your space lab connections can deal with this thing. at least we'll be safe.
speaker1: they are not going anywhere. i cut power to the shuttle. the kids and crutch stare at him. cold hearted.
speaker3: open the doors.
speaker4: something's wrong.
speaker3: keep trying!

speaker1: everyone ready? 
speaker1: fat lou, what's the eta?

speaker1: yuck. 
speaker2: we're screwed.
speaker3: the ship doesn't need pilots to dock. we'll disembark and you'll see.
speaker4: uh...that's gonna be a problem. the ship's not on auto-pilot. we're flying blind. thirty minutes till impact.
speaker3: i guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.
speaker1: but...

speaker1: damnit, he's got them. 
speaker2: rizzo, i think yllo must have done something. the door won't open.

speaker1: it's alright. he can't get in here! wham! wham!!! but the door is starting to give. 
speaker2: the power's back up!
speaker3: then open the doors!
speaker2: thirty seconds.

speaker1: what do we do?!! 
speaker2: crutch?
speaker3: help me up.
speaker1: okay, i'm guessing you should hurry.
speaker4: tell this i don't play hockey!
speaker3: okay!
speaker2: will that take us to the bridge?
speaker3: it's a maze up there, but yes.
speaker2: we'll engage auto-pilot! everything'll be fine! with that, the door gives!
speaker5: heart beat irregular...no blood flow... impossible...this....this... does not make sense.
speaker2: move it people!
speaker6: help me!
speaker2: now hold on! have you considered how valuable you are? credit, fame, you can have it all. and ladies. i mean, how long has it been?
speaker2: that's all you wanted?

speaker1: it's okay, he just wanted his machete. 
speaker2: three...two...one...

speaker1: rizzo, come on! 
speaker2: go-go-go-go-go!!!!
speaker3: he's right behind us!
speaker4: close the door! i'll be right back.
speaker1: what?!!
speaker4: i gotta go back.
speaker1: but?!!

speaker1: i'm quite sure i wasn't designed for this. crutch comes to a fork in the walkway. 
speaker2: okay, we need to ...
speaker3: you forgot didn't you, you old fart?
speaker4: move it! he's coming!
speaker4: go!
speaker4: faster!

speaker1: that was fun. 
speaker2: i got a brand new pair of roller-skates, you got a brand new key...
speaker1: thorgan?!
speaker3: i didn't do it. the fall scattered her programming..wait. where's?
speaker3: hey, i think the fall killed him.
speaker4: trust me, it's temporary.
speaker5: better let me.
speaker3: where'd you get the gun? rizzo gestures at what's left of geko's body.
speaker6: the bridge is this way!
speaker4: wait!
speaker2: there's not enough time.
speaker4: forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
speaker5: what do you mean, not enough time?
speaker2: you know what you get if you shove two bananas up your ass? two covered bananas.
speaker1: i think your metal lover's losing it.
speaker2: impact in ten minutes. it will take fifteen to reach the bridge. mamma's little baby love shortnin, shortnin, mamma's little baby love shotnin bread...

speaker1: guys!!! the shuttle? 
speaker1: idiots.
speaker2: this way!
speaker3: i feel better. now how do you fire this thing?
speaker4: just go! i've a feeling he's right behind us!
speaker2: just around this bend...
speaker5: nooooo!
speaker5: you'll hit crutch!
speaker1: what are you doing? you can't save him!
speaker1: don't just stand there! shoot him!
speaker4: no you don't!

speaker1: don't stop! 
speaker1: you never stop when he's down!
speaker1: shit!!!!
speaker2: forget him. come on.
speaker3: uh-oh.
speaker4: what?!
speaker3: kkinsa! open the doors!
speaker3: kkinsa! he's coming! open the doors!
speaker5: kkinsa, open the door!
speaker1: yeah, that's it, scare the out of here, that'll work.
speaker1: kkinsa, crutch is hurt! we need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

speaker1: med-kit? 
speaker2: i guessed.

speaker1: we're going to be okay, kkinsa. 
speaker2: allow me. i'm trained in all aspects of the human psyche.
speaker2: kkinsa, dear, it is i, kay-em 14... open the door you silly
speaker2: i didn't say i was good at it.

speaker1: the smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble. 
speaker2: did we get him?
speaker3: we're screwed!
speaker4: 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
speaker4: just make a break for the door. he'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
speaker5: we're not leaving crutch!
speaker4: we don't have time to argue!
speaker6: okay, tell you what. you die, we'll run.

speaker1: everyone okay? 
speaker2: i think i broke my arm.
speaker3: i seem to have misplaced mine.
speaker4: you geeks wanna gimmie a hand?
speaker5: we lost crutch.
speaker1: goodbye old friend.
speaker6: okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
speaker1: could you show a little compassion?!
speaker6: look, i'm sorry. i really am, but aren't you forgetting about ... suddenly a pile of rubble explodes. jason rises, his back to them.
speaker5: back to the labs!

speaker1: oh they turn as jason looms toward them, then -- 
speaker2: cargo and debris. our heroes. jason.
speaker3: this is just great.
speaker4: engage magnetics.

speaker1: grab my hand! 
speaker2: boeman, can you reach delongpre?

speaker1: push off toward us. 
speaker2: forget her, she's a pain in the ass. let her hang there.
speaker3: i'm gonna spew.
speaker2: that ought'a help the situation.
speaker1: do it rizzo! we'll catch you.

speaker1: what if you miss? 
speaker2: what if we don't?

speaker1: he's coming right at you! 
speaker2: grab my feet!
speaker3: okay that hurt.
speaker2: thorgan, pull us in.
speaker4: what now?
speaker3: he's gonna send himself right at us. jason takes aim.

speaker1: get off of me! 
speaker2: you think it killed . . . yeah, i guess not.
speaker1: let's just get out of here.
speaker3: the ship's in bad shape. back to the labs. let's check out status.

speaker1:  
speaker2: the hull's imploding!
speaker1: rizzo! can you hear me?!

speaker1: yeah. are you guys okay? 
speaker2: there's a red lever on the wall beside you. pull it!
speaker1: it's locked!
speaker2: then break it! if you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
speaker2: hurry rizzo! you have to reverse the pressurization.
speaker2: what are you doing?!!
speaker1: if the ship goes, so does jaso.
speaker2: rizzo pull the lever!
speaker1: no.
speaker3: rizzo?!
speaker1: it's better this way. if we were rescued jason would just get off the ship. you want him on your precious earth ii?

speaker1: hurry! she's lost it! 
speaker2: so what else is new?

speaker1: boeman don't. you know i'm right. 
speaker2: are you crazy?! pull the lever! boeman yanks the lever.
speaker3: depressurization inconclusive.
speaker4: we've lost too much pressure. an hour, tops.
speaker2: what's the point?
speaker5: so that's it then. it seems it is.
speaker1: what's that?
speaker6: that's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
speaker4: no... that's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
speaker1: are there any other shuttles?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: teleportation? some way to beam us the out of dodge?
speaker7: you read a lot of science fiction didn't you?
speaker2: a little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
speaker4: i'll never experience my fantasy of
speaker7: am i in there?
speaker4: sory...
speaker1: hey.
speaker5: that's a good fantasy, though.
speaker1: hey!!
speaker1: what's this?
speaker5: it's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
speaker1: can we get through these?
speaker7: sure but what good will that do?
speaker6: when the left hull goes, so will the right.
speaker1: what if we blow the walkways first? leave jason over here to go up with the ship?
speaker2: you know, yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth millions.
speaker1: any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
speaker2: i'm just saying.
speaker5: we'd need charges.
speaker6: we could convert fission transistors.
speaker7: we're not supposed to do that.
speaker6: what are you gonna do, tell me?
speaker5: the engine room will have molecular welders. we could seal up the hull.
speaker2: yeah, great idea! and i'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
speaker7: would you?
speaker4: now this is getting exciting.
speaker5: remember to roll his around a bit.
speaker1: you got a better plan?
speaker6: i'll need system four converters.
speaker7: they're back here.
speaker5: how many?
speaker6: bring 'em all. let's move!
speaker7: hey! i'm not ready.
speaker6: then you better hurry. i'll blow alley one, delongpre, you and rizzo take there.
speaker2: you're so bossy.
speaker7: you're leaving me here alone?
speaker5: don't blow your foot off.
speaker4: it's just you and me, then.
speaker7: come here, might as well fix that arm.

speaker1: see anything? 
speaker1: i think i speak on behalf of the group when i say this is bad news.
speaker2: thorgan? you coming?!

speaker1: almost done. 
speaker2: ow!
speaker1: oh, hush. i disengaged your pain programming.
speaker2: sometimes i just wish i had a kitten.

speaker1: put your finger here. 
speaker1: my father wanted me to be a businessman. silence.
speaker1: that's why i'm here.
speaker2: so, you thought you'd be cool. go against your father's wishes? yeah, that's grown up. delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

speaker1: i thought you meant... 
speaker2: you thought i meant...too tough to apologize, huh? you must have been a very lonely girl. silence. neither speaks.

speaker1: sorry, sorry. 
speaker2: who are you apologizing to?
speaker1: good point.

speaker1: when i was four, the ocean quit producing life. too many pollutants. nuclear testing, the occasional terrorist bombing...the atmosphere was by the time i was eight. we moved underground when i was twelve. 
speaker1: my father was an army scientist. genetics. the army thought they could develop humans able to survive the earth we had created janessa moves through the debris.
speaker2: we see janessa come into view.
speaker1: jason seemed to have the right stuff. physically, anyway. radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. he just kept going.

speaker1: were you close to your father? 
speaker2: delongpre? what did you do with the chain gun?
speaker1: it's on the table where i left it! what the are you doing?!
speaker2: i'm on my way.
speaker3: thorgan, quit around and come on!
speaker2: i'm coming, i'm coming.
speaker1: sorry, you were saying?

speaker1: i got along great with my father, my mother too. dad and the others thought they could learn a great deal from this thing the army had been keeping on ice for over a hundred years. 
speaker1: they were all wrong. they couldn't control him.

speaker1: and what happend to ...? 
speaker2: i couldn't save them.
speaker1: well, we'd be dead without you. you know that, don't you?
speaker1: it's true. you caused enough stink that we were at least a little cautious. of course this is the first field trip i went on that had a body count.
speaker1: i'm not much, but i promise, i won't let this guy get you.

speaker1: where is everybody? what happened? 
speaker2: damnit! you scared the out of me!
speaker1: give me a break! what happened?
speaker2: jason. he's what happened. then grendel hit space lab.
speaker1: space lab?! wait'll i get my hands on yllo.
speaker2: yllo's dead. we...we thought you were too.
speaker1: takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.

speaker1: well go on! pass out! 
speaker1: 
speaker2: he-help me...
speaker3: i'm blowing walkway one. hold on. ka-foom! the ship bucks!
speaker4: we're blowing three. hang on.
speaker3: janessa, we're on our way to you!

speaker1: where is...? 
speaker2: you tell me! she's only set one charge. and it's not finished!
speaker1: where have you been?!!
speaker3: he....he...
speaker2: he's coming!!!

speaker1: run!! 
speaker2: we can't lead him into the other hull!
speaker1: we don't have a choice!

speaker1: do i have to? 
speaker2: yes, i've reprogrammed you.
speaker1: oh, alright.

speaker1: come on, boy. let's see if we can open up can'a whoop ass! 
speaker2: holy

speaker1: what are we waiting for?!! come on!! 
speaker1: where the were you?!!
speaker2: he came for me, i had to run!
speaker3: kay-em, you okay?

speaker1: toss me a chip. 
speaker1: thorgan, you're brilliant. have i told you that lately?
speaker2: see you around.

speaker1: i'd say we have about ten minutes tops. 
speaker2: then stop talking and work faster!

speaker1: she was a young and charming girl; her age was scarce sixteen. 
speaker1: she took me in and she kicked out a sailor and marine.
speaker1: she had no on her chest; that didn't bother me,

speaker1: for what she had between her legs was big enough for three. 
speaker2: okay, janessa, give me your last charge. janessa looks around, then --
speaker3: i...i don't know what i did...
speaker4: you lost the charge?
speaker3: he was chasing me!
speaker5: can we blow it with just two?
speaker2: if we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
speaker4: then what do we do?!
speaker2: i don't know!

speaker1: well, it was a good plan. 
speaker2: you stupid
speaker2: to hell, you left me back there to die!
speaker3: sergeant? we thought you were...
speaker2: yeah, yeah. well, what have you got to say for yourself?
speaker4: i don't know...sorry?
speaker5: sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
speaker2: bomb?
speaker3: explosive. we're blowing the walkway.
speaker2: how much you need?

speaker1: that was very good. you should feel very good about yourself right now. good effort. how could you hit a girl you sumbitch?! 
speaker1: okay, dip time to finish you off so i can go home and boink your momma with a corndog. the
speaker2: the top portion of jason's mask shatters!

speaker1: oh...my...god. what have i done? thorgan! 
speaker1: thorgan i'm a murderer!

speaker1: blowing the walkway? you come up with that yourself? 
speaker2: rizzo did.
speaker3: kay-em!
speaker2: what are you doing back?!!
speaker4: sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
speaker5: you killed him?
speaker4: blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. and look at me! i'm covered in his filthy blood!
speaker3: you did good, kay-em. i'm proud of you.
speaker4: a real mamma's boy that one. dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. little good it did him.
speaker5: his mother?
speaker2: what?
speaker5: i don't know. nothing.
speaker2: hurry up people! we're running out of time.

speaker1: as long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance. 
speaker2: two more charges to go.

speaker1: done! 
speaker2: let's move out!
speaker3: kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?
speaker4: i need another minute. come on!

speaker1: well me. 
speaker2: no, me.

speaker1: kay-em? re-engage killer instinct. 
speaker2: yeeee-haw!!!!

speaker1:  
speaker2: kay-em!!!
speaker1: done!!

speaker1: kay-em! get away! 
speaker2: that's the best you can do?
speaker2: is that it? come back and fight like a man!

speaker1: hurry! 
speaker2: run toward the door. but, thorgan stops.
speaker3: what...?
speaker3: what are you doing?!!
speaker4: i think i'm going to throw up...
speaker5: jason raises his machete from his belt and --
speaker6: hey,
speaker6: go!
speaker6: oh, yeah, you remember me. he sure does.

speaker1: hurry! 
speaker2: faster! don't we have another gun?
speaker3: they're not gonna make it. close the door before he gets us all.
speaker2: they'll make it.
speaker3: close the door!

speaker1: damnit! 
speaker1: forget it. i had to rewire it.

speaker1: get ready to blow it. 
speaker1: now!

speaker1: damage? 
speaker2: minimal.
speaker3: we made it?
speaker4: i think...i think maybe we did.
speaker5: thorgan looks into kay-em 14's severed head.
speaker6: kay-em we made it!
speaker7: oh, goody. i'm so pleased. i'd clap if i could.
speaker2: i've changed the course for earth ii.
speaker8: roger, grendel. what's the problem?
speaker2: our ship has been damaged, most of the crew dead. we need evac.
speaker8: copy that grendel. rescue enroute. you should hit earth ii orbit in fifteen minutes. rescue eta twenty minutes.

speaker1: we're going home people. more cheers. 
speaker2: see? we're not so bad.
speaker3: not so bad.

speaker1: pull me in! 
speaker2: i'm pulling, damnit!

speaker1: we need weapons. 
speaker2: weapons? all this technology and what good has it done?!
speaker3: it bought us some time.
speaker4: and now we're all out of it.
speaker4: the ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. when it reaches the core, we're done.
speaker2: done?
speaker5: kaboom.
speaker3: again?!
speaker2: why am i not surprised?
speaker6: you must shut down the engines.
speaker3: then do it. the rescue ship can find us here right?
speaker1: can't shut em' down from here.
speaker4: somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
speaker3: you ain't catching my in there again.
speaker1: i'll go. the kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.
speaker4: you're too weak. i'll go.
speaker2: you know, this future
speaker3: you?
speaker2: wait around on your all day. i'll need a distraction.
speaker5: what kind of a distraction?

speaker1: come on, keep up. 
speaker1: you want some of me or not?
speaker1: take your best shot --

speaker1: i'm melting! i'm melting! 
speaker1: see now that was stupid. persistent, yes, but stupid.
speaker1: not this time, this time i'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

speaker1: make it fast. he's coming. 
speaker2: almost got it.

speaker1: hurry up, guys. we've got the rescue ship on radar. 
speaker2: delongpre! out of time!
speaker3: got it!
speaker4: that was close!

speaker1: guys, he's right behind us! 
speaker2: it's okay.
speaker3: okay?!!
speaker2: just come on, i've got an idea.

speaker1: there's damage, lots of it. 
speaker2: the docking bay was damaged after the explosion. meet us at the airlock.
speaker3: got it. you ever space walked?
speaker4: oh sure, all the time.
speaker5: ka-fwam! jason barrels right through the door.
speaker4: damit, thorgan, whatever you're doing... you'd better hurry! i hate the future!

speaker1: don't worry. he can't see us. 
speaker2: is that...?

speaker1: earth ii. 
speaker2: suit up.
speaker1: i'll help you in.
speaker3: kay-em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?

speaker1: i get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but i get a kick out of you. 
speaker2: goodbye, my love.
speaker3: thorgan, suit up.
speaker2: this is gonna work. if he sticks to the program. will he? stick to the program?
speaker4: his mother was killed before his eyes.
speaker5: that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future
speaker4: eat me.

speaker1: help me, jason, please! help your mother! jason moves closer. 
speaker1: don't let me die again!
speaker2: pauses staring at the please for help.

speaker1: oh, he's going to see us. 
speaker2: well, do something!

speaker1:  
speaker2: just a little more time.

speaker1: sergeant! 
speaker2: get out of here!
speaker2: that all you got?!!
speaker3: he saved our lives.
speaker4: boeman, the ships not here.
speaker1: use the thrusters and you'll be fine. we'll huddle together out there.

speaker1: hey, easy now. 
speaker1: you wanna release your air tanks?
speaker2: okay, good tip.
speaker1: you'll be fine.
speaker3: remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. we'll be fine.
speaker2: why wouldn't we be. i mean, look around. so far so good.
speaker1: don't worry. he can't get through that door.
speaker3: thrusters.
speaker4: our group enters deep space.

speaker1: rizzo, you okay? 
speaker2: no i'm not okay! i don't know what the i'm doing!
speaker1: you're doing fine. i won't let anything happen to you, remember?

speaker1: he preses the button 
speaker2: ahhhhh!

speaker1: i think i had some when i was eight. 
speaker2: did you like it?
speaker1: i think so, why?
speaker3: he's trying to ask you out on a date.
speaker2: shut up, thorgan!
speaker1: delongpre, you don't even know me.
speaker2: i know you.
speaker2: nooooooo!!

speaker1: rizzo, pull away!
