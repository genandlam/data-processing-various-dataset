MARCO: the cataleya orchid. his symbol. your name. that's good. this way you will always remember him.
MARCO: i know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen.
MARCO: some things are too complicated for a kid to understand. this is one of them. but i am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you. so you understand. now, you know who don luis is?
CLOSE ON HER HAND: touches the handle of the knife taped there.
MARCO: of course you do. he was your father's best friend since they're kids. he's like an uncle to you. you know he has always been good to your family, don't you?
MARCO: this house, the food you eat, the clothes you wear. even your school fees. all this comes from don luis. you know that?

MARCO: but when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back, then bad things happen. things like... 
MARCO: this.
MARCO: i know you are a smart girl. you do well in school. so i know this is not too complicated for you to understand. am i right?
MARCO: good. now, your father had something that belonged to don luis. a little thing. no bigger than...
MARCO: this. maybe it was in this.
MARCO: do you know what i am talking about?
CLOSE ON CAT'S HAND: gripping the knife handle.
MARCO: excellent. do you know where it is?
MARCO: well, if you give it to me, don luis will be very grateful. and very generous. he will make sure that you are clothed, fed, and sent to the very best school. you will have everything you want.

MARCO: but if you don't give it to him, he will be very unhappy. and you see what happens when he is not happy, yes? 
MARCO: so why don't you just give that little thing which belongs to him. will you do that?
MARCO: you are a smart girl.
MARCO: and in this life, smart girls get everything they want. what do you want cat?

MARCO: just tell me sweetheart...what do you want?

AMERICAN 1: and where is your papa?

AMERICAN 1: did he tell you what this is?

EMILIO: when was the last time you slept?
CAT: i don't know. a long time ago.
EMILIO: well good. a growing body needs sleep. when i was your age i would sleep half the day. i don't know if it helped with the growing, but i was well rested for whatever came after.
CAT: whose room is that?
EMILIO: my son. your cousin.
CAT: where is he?

EMILIO: he's dead. 
CAT: killed?
EMILIO: yes.

CAT: i used to want to be like lara. a super agent.
EMILIO: not anymore?
EMILIO: and now?
CAT: i want to be a killer.
CAT: can you help?
EMILIO: sure.

EMILIO: the good news is your father bought you your life with what he gave you. the bad news is don luis was playing both sides, and has disappeared. you tore down everything he spent years building up with that little chip. it is something he will not forget. there is a law in this thing of ours. if someone does you, the revenge goes all the way down the line. women, children, grandmothers, dogs, cats. no exceptions. 
CAT: are you trying to scare me?
EMILIO: i am trying to educate you.

PRINCIPAL: normally we don't accept students in the middle of the academic year, but under the circumstances, losing her parents in that tragic car accident... 
PRINCIPAL: here.
PRINCIPAL: these are the school supplies you'll need.
EMILIO: she's still in a bit of shock.
PRINCIPAL: of course. see you monday cataleya. such a pretty name.

EMILIO: we'll get all this stuff, then go over to this little place i know down on maxwell street for some of these hot dogs the polish people make here. 
EMILIO: you like hot dogs?
EMILIO: hey!
EMILIO: hey!
EMILIO: where you going?
CAT: i've already been to school. i told you what i want to be. you don't want to help me, fine. i'll do it myself.
EMILIO: chica. any can be a killer. look!
EMILIO: you want me to teach you to be a killer? no problema. i'll teach you. but you'll be dead in five years.

EMILIO: if you want to be a killer, and survive, you have to be a smart one. you have to know things besides how to pull a trigger. you have to know how the world works. how people think. you got to learn to be psychological. that i cannot teach you, unless you learn the basics at school. got it? 
EMILIO: now what's it going to be?
CAT: but i still want to be a killer.
EMILIO: cabron!

ROSS: twenty two murders in four years all with the same m.o. the word, the flower. he's sending a message, for sure. and i'm beginning to think it's not to us.
AGENT 1: but we're the only ones with the information.
ROSS: and we're not getting anywhere with it, are we?
ROSS: if the message is not for us, let's make sure the one it's intended for gets it. i want you to put it out to the press. splash it across every newspaper, every magazine. national. i want eyeballs on it coast to coast. monitor it. let's see if anything comes back.

DON LUIS: hello mr. richard.
RICHARD: i brought you the morning paper.

DON LUIS: i've seen it.

DON LUIS: fabio. fabio maria restrepo. but i don't understand? why come here with this?
RICHARD: because when we find the end of a string we like to know where it begins.
DON LUIS: string? now we are talking about string? i'm not a tailor.
RICHARD: don luis. let's cut to the chase here, ok? when the agency extracted your from colombia fifteen years ago, and set you up here, we let you resume your business when what we should have done was lock you up for life. in exchange, you were supposed to keep the information flowing.
DON LUIS: and i have.

RICHARD: not much, and not for a very long time. 
DON LUIS: and this is what you traveled all the way down here to tell me?
RICHARD: no. what i traveled all the way down here to tell you, is there's a limit to our patience. the cia is not an amusement park. there are no free rides. everyone pays their way. and you, my friend, have not.
DON LUIS: ok ok. what would you want?
DON LUIS: i had nothing to do with this. i swear.
RICHARD: then find out who does.
RICHARD: and don luis, don't play the innocent with us. it won't sit well with my bosses if we find out you had anything to do with this. have a good day.

ROSS: ...tried to take over the heroin trade in houston from...
ROSS: the gemini cartel. their crimes are self explanatory, if you can read. now i know some of you are thinking whoever is doing this makes less work for mother. and since there's no collateral damage, why are we wasting valuable manpower and resources on the case? and since until now, there has never been a clue to go on, why go on? but with this last killing... he holds up a stack of folders from his desk.

ROSS: we have one. as we go to the video tape. 
ROSS: we can't see the assassin, but we can see...
ROSS: the time. 2 am. which means our perp was in the station at...i don't have to spell it out for you.
ROSS: these are the names, phone numbers and addresses of everyone with a pulse who entered that police station before two am. cops, criminals, clerks, janitors. everyone. one of them is our target. i want each of you to locate the ten people in the folder you've been given. i want a complete dossier on every one of them for the last ten years of their lives. run down every lead. check out every story. our killer is out there. and we're going to find him. before he kills again.

CAT: talking about covering all your bases. your chair is pressure wired. you move your one inch you don't have one anymore.
CAT: i know what you're thinking. maybe yes a bluff, maybe no. but you have to figure yes, given what you know about me.
CAT: this wasn't what i had in mind for myself when i was a kid. i wanted to be on the other side of things.
ROSS: so what happened?
CAT: he did.
CAT: this is the last time i was happy.

CAT: the next day they were dead. he killed them. 
ROSS: and all this? all these clues...they weren't for us. they were for him.
CAT: i didn't know how else to find him.
ROSS: and you figured sooner or later we would make this public.
CAT: it took you a long time.
ROSS: you're very patient.
CAT: what else do i have to be? i have no one. i did. until this morning. i had them.
ROSS: you sent him a message. he sent you one back.
CAT: and now i want to finish it.
ROSS: i can't help you.
CAT: yes you can. he's protected by your government.
ROSS: by a part of the government i have no way of reaching. it's cia. i don't know why. but there's no getting through it, under it, around it, believe me, i've tried.
CAT: you're going to have to try harder.

CAT: i found this on your table inside. your family, right? 
CAT: brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews. mother, father. nice.

RICHARD: really? where?
ROSS: my apartment. she trapped me. she told me if i did not get her this man.
ROSS: she will kill a member of my family every day until i have none.
RICHARD: you're kidding me?

ROSS: so? what should i do now?
RICHARD: i'd go to the police. now if you'll excuse me, i have a meeting...
ROSS: ross.
ROSS: it's her.

ROSS: she says you either give her what she wants or she is going to redecorate your office.
ROSS: bright red.
RICHARD: what does she think this is? amateur hour? tell her that glass is tempered to resist a direct hit by a fifty seven millimeter ordinance.
ROSS: she says she's using seven point six two steel jacketed armor piercing shells. and you have ten seconds to give her the address.
RICHARD: how can i be sure once she has the address she won't kill me anyway?
ROSS: you can't. but i can assure you that if you don't give her the address you will be number twenty four on her hit parade. trust me on this one.
RICHARD: eight seven six magnolia terrace... new orleans.

MARCO: don luis! you hide here. 
MARCO: wait for my call. either she is dead, or we have her far enough away so you can make it to the garage. take the van. the armor is so thick nothing short of an atomic bomb can penetrate it.
DON LUIS: marco. thank you.

DON LUIS: i don't understand you. you should have been dead a long time ago. you got lucky. you escaped. you were given a second chance at a life. why did you not take it? why did you involve yourself with this insanity?
CAT: for something you can never understand. the love i had for my parents. and you killed that.
DON LUIS: and because of that, you have ruined your whole life to try to kill me? you stupid don't you get it? someone like me?

DON LUIS: i cannot be killed. i do the killing. not the other way around. and now it is your turn to be hunted. you will never find me. but as day follows night, believe me, i will find you. and i will kill you. and you know why? because i will never be where you can kill me. i will never be where you want me to be. 
CAT: actually don luis...you are exactly where i want you to be.
