VINNY: you can't leave him on his own, not to begin with, he gets homesick.
SOL: homesick, for sake.
VINNY: he does. if he gets the chance he runs back to the gypsies' campsite.
SOL: ohh shut up, how can he find it?
VINNY: i don't know sol, i am not a dog. ask him. it' s like he's got a homing beacon. give him the chance and he's off.

DOUG: did you get hands that car? 
ALEX: i got him one like it.
DOUG: what do you mean one like it?
ALEX: i got him the volante.
DOUG: what did i say? what exactly did i say?
ALEX: you said get him the vantage.
DOUG: that's right, i clearly said get him the vantage. so why did you get the volante? ;
ALEX: because they look the same.
DOUG: the septuagint scholars mistranslated the hebrew word for "young woman" in to the greek word for "virgin", because they thought they looked the same, coming up with the prophecy "behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son". but there is a world of difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a volante and a vantage.
ALEX: are you saying that the fact that your cousin hands is driving a valiant instead of a vantage is a profound a mistake as a whole religion?
DOUG: yes i am!

DOUG: how about a hug for your old cousin doug? 
Â· HANDS: off you fat bald - and where's my car?

TYRONE: what's in the case?
SOL: 'ell tyrone you ask a lot of questions. you concentrate on the driving okay?
SOL: was that him?

SOL: what do you need the tape off your eyes for? you talk out of them?
FRANKY THREE FINGERS: i can't remember the combination i can only do it if i see it .
VINNY: you look at us and it's good night.
SOL: come on.
VINNY: and?
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS: and here's the money.

VINNY: i don't believe this. why are you carrying round a case with this little in it? . . 
FRANKY FOUR FINGERS: now be a bunch of good fellas and lie down on the floor.
TYRONE: whoops.
TYRONE: hello what have we got here?

DOUG: tony. bullet tooth tony. he'll find franky for you.
HANDS: who's he?
SUSI: â·what is he?' would be a more appropriate question.
DOUG: he's the best chance you have of finding franky.

SUSI: he has upset every bad boy in town, at some point, or another but nobody's got the nuts to knock him off because they aren't sure whether you can kill the bastard.

MICKY: the fight is twice the size. and my mum still needs a new caravan.
TURKISH: micky you are lucky we aren't worm food after your performance, i think buying a tart's mobile palace is a little rich.
TURKISH: i didn't mean that your mum was a tart. i just meant...

TURKISH: we buy him a caravan tommy.
TOMMY: there is something very wrong with this, it was us that wanted to buy a caravan off him.
TURKISH: why didn't you "bus a cap in his ass" then tommy? mind you, you would do more damage if you threw it at him.
TOMMY: you saying i can't shoot?
TURKISH: oh no tommy i wasn't saying you can't shoot, i know you can't shoot. what i was saying is that six pound piece of stuck in your trousers there would do more damage if you fed it to em.
TOMMY: are you saying it doesn't work?
TURKISH: you tried it?
TURKISH-: .=.. . that russian saves the shooters that "' work for the faces, and i don't want to be the one that breaks it to you tommy but you ain't a face. go on try it.

TURKISH: whoops. 
TOMMY: i want to see that sneaky russian.

BAD BOY LINCOLN: what happened to him? 
SOL: he got shot in the face lincoln, i would have thought that was obvious.
BA D BOY LINCOLN: well what do you want me to do about it?
SOL: sort it out.
BAD BOY LINCOLN: the only way to sort it out is to bring him back to life and i am not a witch doctor am i?
SOL: villains are supposed to know how to get rid of bodies.
BAD BOY LINCOLN: err, yes, but i have never actually got rid of one. who is he?
SOL: he's a man with a hole in his face lincoln. who cares who he is?
BAD BOY LINCOLN: err well, let's wrap him up.
SOL: what do you want to do that for?

TURKISH: i am sorry, but he's a stubborn bastard, he says he's had enough, he says he's got to look after his old mum. 
BRICK TOP: his what? â·.-â· . ..
BRICK TOP: are' you taking the again?
TURKISH: that's what he said, she's a nice old girl his mum.

BRICK TOP: hope it ' s not a bad moment.
BRICK TOP: do you know who i am?
BAD BOY LINCOLN: yeah i know.
BRICK TOP: good. that will save me some time then.
VINNY: well i don't.
BRICK TOP: what you gonna do with your man there? you're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. apparently the best thing to do is cut the corpse up into six pieces and pile it all together.

SOL: would someone mind telling me who you are? 
BRICK TOP: after you got six pieces you gotta get rid of 'em, of course you can't just leave it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, can ya?
VINNY: lincoln, who is this man?
BRICK TOP: and then i hear the best thing to do is feed 'em to pigs. you gotta starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped up body looks like curry to a drunk. you gotta shave the heads of your victims and pull the teeth out, you could do that after of course, but you don't want to go sieving pig do you? ever seen the size of one of their molars? â· he holds up his fist
BRICK TOP: they go through bone like i t ' s butter. you gotta have a few pigs though you need about sixteen they will go through a body that weighs two hundred pounds in about eight minutes that means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute,. . . pause
BRICK TOP: hence the expression greedy as a pig.
VINNY: well thank you, that's a large weight off my mind.

VINNY: but would you mind very much telling me who the' you are? other than a man that feeds people to pigs of course. 
JOHN: would you look at the size of this?
BRICK TOP: golly that is big isn't it errol?
BRICK TOP: do you know what nemesis means?
BRICK TOP: a righteous infliction of retribution â·by. an appropriate agent, personified in this case by a horrible me.

SOL: let go of the gun.
BTT: i am talking for your benefit. now have drive, and clarity of vision.
BTT: but they're not clever, they smell pussy, and they want a piece of the action, and the dimmer the dick, the less he cares about the consequences, and you thought you smelt gooood ol pussy, and have brought your little mincy along for a gooood ol time, but you have got your parties muddled up, there is no here, just a dose to make you wish you were born a woman.. . .
BTT: and just like a prick, you are having second thoughts; you're shrinking, and your little are shrinking with you.

ERROL: do you know why the governor is the governor?
VINNY: err. .
ERROL: i t 's because people are scared of him. you know why they are scared of him?
SOL: err .
ERROL: it's because of stories. i am sure you've heard one or two of those stories. for example, did you hear about the three black fellas that did a very bad thing, however they made some effort to redeem that very bad thing, so the governor saw fit not to kill em. he thought it would be a more advantageous concept to let them kill each other and let the survivor live to tell the tale. that way everybody wins, well, all except the two that died of course.

SOL: what? 
VINNY: the gun you prick.

BTT: well you gotta admire their balls. 
HANDS: _ i don't want to admire that i want to chop off.
