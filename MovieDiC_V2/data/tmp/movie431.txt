WOMAN: i have money to pay it,
PUBLIC RELATIONS MAN: yea, we had abc filming a documentary here last week

ANNOUNCER: springtime in paree. our elegante dinner pajamas. in airy aquamarine chiffon and mediterranean blue peau de soie. delightfully carefree, yet formal enough for an ambassadorial reception at the palace of versailles. 
BARNEY: "screw you, wilma." why didn't you tell me?
ARCHIE: how is she?
BARNEY: you tell me.
ARCHIE: oh, great, terrific, you wouldn't believe it. terrific. and her rib?

ARCHIE: why do we have to eat topless?
BARNEY: the best irish stew in town.
BARNEY: she said you beat her up. kidding, of course.
BARNEY: you must have been a little rough on her, daddy.

ANNOUNCER: opening night at the opera. though the curtain has risen on the first act of aida, all eyes are on the royal box, mi lady in dazzling velvet: cardinal richelieu rouge. the utter simplicity of her full-length gown is subtly accented by the merest suggestion of gay abandon. 
BARNEY: archie ?
ARCHIE: barney ?
BARNEY: you know how long i've known you?

ARCHIE: forever? 
BARNEY: that's how long. and polo and the kids. that's exactly how long.
BARNEY'S VOICE: so i have a right to my opinion; it's breaking wilma's heart; that's all we talk about. you think you're different than anybody else? every time i leave my house it's the last time, i'm never coming back. you're not listening to me, archie.
ARCHIE'S VOICE: barney, for chrissake, i'm listening to you,
BARNEY'S VOICE: you're thinking about that hot cat in your bed, you bastard.

BARNEY'S VOICE: my record is far from spotless, if you don't know that, who does? but baby, it's just not the answer, not at our age. 
ARCHIE'S VOICE: so what's the answer, baby?
BARNEY'S VOICE: ã¢â€â¢ someplace you can belch without saying excuse me!
ARCHIE'S VOICE: i can do that in the steam room at the ymca.
BARNEY'S VOICE: and if a little monkey business comes along, whose gonna throw rocks? you and polo were a marvellous looking couple.

10 BARNEY'S VOICE: is there something wrong with being a groovy looking couple? people turning around to stare? what was it, archie? 
ARCHIE'S VOICE: barney, what would you say if i told you that one day i just got very tired of being married?

ARCHIE: i don't know what i want. to feel something, 
BARNEY: that's no answer; archie, grow up!

POLO: it's such a puzzle. we really got on so marvelously. never fought. never screamed at each other. not once.
POLO: everybody we knew envied us.
ARCHIE: we were a handsome couple.
POLO: i think i've fallen in love. the man is warren smith. he's an engineer and very good with the children, but he wants to go back to school and get his masters in hydraulics. well, say something.

POLO: until he is established with some hydraulics firma i hope it won't be too long, i mean for everybody's sake.

POLO: needless to say there are certain problems.

35: 32b continued 
POLO: he lives in such a depressing, rented room. it gives me claustrophobia.
ARCHIE: poor polo.
POLO: it's such an icky little room.
ARCHIE: tell the kids i'll come for them 0 sunday at eight.
POLO: they'll be ready. i thought the decent thing was to come here and talk in a civilized manner. about the change in my situation.
ARCHIE: i appreciate it, polo.
POLO: good night, archie.
ARCHIE: you've got a run in your stocking.

LARGE GUARD: now you folks keep moving along that bridge. you keep moving along and give other folks a chance. there's lots of pretty things to do. you keep moving right along. you won't want to forget our niponese souvenir pagoda where every item is the real mccoy. that's right. keep moving, that's the ticket. sergeant, you've been standing there some time now. during this, may and archie talk. '.s 32 and pretty. its a nice day but archie is not happy. polo, warren, maybe petulia mostly it's kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor, . and may have been sitting on the grass. gracefully she rises to her feet, doing everything just right, even this. 
ARCHIE: nobody in the world can sit on the grass and not wrinkle.
ARCHIE: no, perfect. not even a blade of grass. why don't i marry you, may?
MAY: why don't you, ar^hie?
ARCHIE: tell me about bobby kennedy.
ARCHIE: picasso? pickles?

ARCHIE: choose a subject. ice cubes. any thing. take either side. talk for thirty seconds against ice cubes. 
MAY: why the hostility, archie?
ARCHIE: that dress shop of yours. "boutique." i've never seen one of those ... your rubber mannequins .. i've never once seen the pipe sticking out of their bottoms. not once, not one time. that bothers me, may.
ARCHIE: i'm not hostile, it's frustration. in all that perfection, how could a clumsy clot like me possibly be fitted in? i mean, without spoiling the whole effect.
MAY: don't worry about it. you'll be going back to polo.
ARCHIE: no, she's found a fellah.
MAY: oh.
MAY: i'd just about given up on you,
ARCHIE: what i should do is marry you.
Ã‚Â€Â¢: thoroughly annoyed.

KAY: archie, if it would please you, i'll submit a list of my faults, some of which might shake you up a bit. 
ARCHIE: it would be a fake list.
MAY: probably, it wouldn't be a fake list. actually, i wear arch supports, my depilatory causes a nasty little rash, and i've lost 10% of my hearing in less than a year .. okay?

ARCHIE: well of all people. 
PETULIA: all that about the humanitarian- ism of the medical profession.

ARCHIE: goodbye, petulia.

ARCHIE: i should explain about petuliaa she is a kook. we are going to be married. 
PETULIA: archie, when you try to sound cool and "with it," you're really pathetic. we're trying to have an intelligent conversation...
ARCHIE: about what?
PETULIA: well, about polo, among other things.
ARCHIE: polo is none of your business.
PETULIA: that's dumb. dumb. she's my business and she's this lady's business. i happen to hate polo.
ARCHIE: needless to say she's never even met polo.
PETULIA: i look at you and i know polo. explain that to him.
PETULIA: how many years were you married., archie? eight? ten? anyhow, the best, wasted. gone down the drain.
ARCHIE: oh, come on ..o
PETULIA: archie, we are from two different worlds. we've got nothing to agree on. except one thing. you're a lonely screwed up mess. 0 archie, i'm trying to save you. you're a very special man.

ARCHIE: oh, 
PETULIA: tell him, may.
PETULIA: you don't think so?
MAY: i won't put archie on a pedestal. he'll do.
PETULIA: you've got yourself another winner, archie.
MAY: it's a joke, you're both putting me on.
ARC HIE: petulia. i mean it. tubas. all this e "i love lucy" jazz. it's only cute for awhile.
PETULIA: it's not meant to be cute. i'm fighting for your life.
ARCHIE: who's trying to kill me?

MR. DANNER: they say lima is a terrific city. if you watch out for flies and take sensible sanitary precautions. i'll tell you a secret but don't you snitch: i'm using propaganda on david so that the four of 0 us can go. mother's a better sailor than i am. even though i served eighteen months on a mine sweeper. which should have prepared me for anything.

MR. DANNER: i want you to remember what this man just said. though it's none of your business, my boy was in baton rouge, louisiana.
PETULIA: we've decided we're quite happy with the one we have.
DAVID: when dad phoned me i was having dinner with a cousin of ours. real mouth- watering creole cooking.
PETULIA: i'm fine archie. except i burp a lot. everybody gets dizzy spells.

PETULIA: where else could i go? a lonely hotel room? i don't have a penny of my own. mr. danner promised me i'd never be left alone. i thought i'd try it for a few days. don't be-angry. it was nobody's fault. actually, if anyone is to blame, it's you, archie. 
ARCHIE: me?i.o

88: 87b continued archie is stunned. 
ARCHIE: i'm looking for the ticket for my raincoat.
