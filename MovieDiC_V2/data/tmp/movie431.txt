speaker2: i've been told that i'll be the one to draw the winning ticket. i'm always picked for things like that. i radiate incorruptibility. money can't buy me.
speaker2: it feels so super. suddenly, all that love.

speaker1: archie, why do you play this game? this crappy pretense at resisting the beautiful lady? you're lucky i'm even talking to you. how many kids do you have besides fat mike? 
speaker2: six.
speaker1: g'night.
speaker2: actually, only one besides mike.

speaker1: it's a problem.

speaker1: only if we make it one. 
speaker2: do you have any slides or swings for children?
speaker3: no, ma'am. you got kids?

speaker3: this isn't that sort of place. no auto.

speaker1: s continued 
speaker2: you've got a very nice t,v, face.
speaker3: thank you, ma' amp,

speaker3: no, just be natural.
speaker3: we've got an elevator but its just for going out for the paper and the like. i mean when you don't want to take the car. you'll have to use the ramp because of the key. it lets you know when you get to your room.

speaker1: it shouldn't be charming. you're missing the whole point. it should be menacing .,, 
speaker1: ,..gray . terribly distraught headlights of passing cars lighting up our room .,.

speaker1: ... a police car careening down the highway, sirens going full blast. and i plunge madly into your arms 
speaker2: my apartment's only four blocks from

speaker1: you have 624 women in this room and i'm still counting. 
speaker1: just wait a minute, okay?
speaker1: my great-grandmother is ninety-one and still has a granite chin.

speaker1: what a lecherous lot 
speaker2: she's ninety-ones eh?
speaker1: but no fun.
speaker2: not at ninety-one,
speaker1: she stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her husband was killed in the first war, in a trench looking just like cary grant with a waxed moustache. she can't remember him but she does remember cary grant because he is from bristol, too, and often in the news. if his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed moustache whether he likes it or not. she turns to face archie. she is afraid and she is angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one

speaker1: stop being so casual. 
speaker1: we're about ã¯â¿â½td become lovers, did you bring an instrument, archie?
speaker2: eh?
speaker1: ring for room service. ask the robot for something splendid and musical,,
speaker2: saxophone? electric organ? tuba?
speaker1: a tuba. absolutely; bless you, ar--hie; a tuba; something large and twirly and pom to pom .pomx archie, this is an event. we 0 are about to become lovers.

speaker2: it can't be said often enough.
speaker1: are we?
speaker2: are we what?
speaker1: about to become lovers?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: ah, you swinging young marrieds.

speaker1: real honest-to-god tears, petulia? 
speaker2: tears, archie.

speaker1: if he gets you there in time, you can still 
speaker1: it's the pepsi generation 0 he walks into the night alone.

speaker1: i'm up, thanks. 
speaker1: yeah... yeah 000 yeah 000

speaker1: 14b continued 
speaker2: aren't i a kook? if you think you're

speaker1: no, i've been up for hours, waiting for the doorbell to ring, 
speaker2: , 0 think how surprised the-man who owns the pawnshop is going to be when he sees all that broken glass.

speaker1: archie, how come the burglar alarm didn't go off? 
speaker2: 0 the scene continues.
speaker3: wherets it all going to end if the burglar alarms won't go off? take me to bed, archie,
speaker4: get the out of here . please.

speaker1: i've got a broken rib, i think, i can feel it broken, archie. 
speaker2: don't you know you can puncture a lunge
speaker1: hopping around with tubas and stuff -- isntt it kooky, though?
speaker1: when are we going to stop trying to undress me?
speaker2: shut up.
speaker1: leave me alone, archie.

speaker1: it's just a rib to me, 
speaker2: that's why. call a proper doctor,
speaker3: what do you think i am?
speaker2: a hairy legged old lecher running around in pajama bottoms,
speaker3: get your clothes off,
speaker2: as a woman, not as a rib.
speaker3: i'm awake! i'm awake; how many times are you gonna call?i he hangs up, then realizes this was the first wake up call.

speaker1: you've got a super build for a man your age. 
speaker1: where are all the family pictures?
speaker1: the family pictures!
speaker1: polo and the boys.

speaker1: 16b continued 
speaker2: i'll bet you named her polo. don't ever start mucking about with "petulia".
speaker3: whatã‚â°s her real name?
speaker4: prudence.
speaker3: and you named her polo. that's kind of sickening, archie.

speaker1: i want him here every day. for therapy. 
speaker2: si, yes, doctor. i do,
speaker1: every day. tell him that.

speaker1: what'd he say? 
speaker2: he say yes.
speaker1: you sure? otherwise we keep you in the hospital. you're not well, just better. say that. the woman tells oliver in spanish as archie continues examining the leg.
speaker1: sorry, pal.
speaker3: where he learn such words shame on you. shame.
speaker1: every day. same time. two o'clock, right on the dot. sorry , ,
speaker2: he terrible.
speaker1: i like the way he heals.

speaker1: cut that out, you little spit, 
speaker2: archie stops to hear what the woman has to say.
speaker3: about the bill, doctor.
speaker4: is she okay?
speaker5: lunch.
speaker6: his leg will be fine. don't worry too much about the bill. just enough to pay it.
speaker3: i have money to pay it,
speaker7: yea, we had abc filming a documentary here last week

speaker1: springtime in paree. our elegante dinner pajamas. in airy aquamarine chiffon and mediterranean blue peau de soie. delightfully carefree, yet formal enough for an ambassadorial reception at the palace of versailles. 
speaker2: "screw you, wilma." why didn't you tell me?
speaker3: how is she?
speaker2: you tell me.
speaker3: oh, great, terrific, you wouldn't believe it. terrific. and her rib?
speaker2: i taped it. gave her some seconal. ã¢â€â¢ should have a vertical just to be safe.
speaker3: why do we have to eat topless?
speaker2: the best irish stew in town.
speaker2: she said you beat her up. kidding, of course.
speaker2: you must have been a little rough on her, daddy.

speaker1: opening night at the opera. though the curtain has risen on the first act of aida, all eyes are on the royal box, mi lady in dazzling velvet: cardinal richelieu rouge. the utter simplicity of her full-length gown is subtly accented by the merest suggestion of gay abandon. 
speaker2: archie ?
speaker3: barney ?
speaker2: you know how long i've known you?

speaker1: forever? 
speaker2: that's how long. and polo and the kids. that's exactly how long.
speaker3: so i have a right to my opinion; it's breaking wilma's heart; that's all we talk about. you think you're different than anybody else? every time i leave my house it's the last time, i'm never coming back. you're not listening to me, archie.
speaker4: barney, for chrissake, i'm listening to you,
speaker3: you're thinking about that hot cat in your bed, you bastard.

speaker1: my record is far from spotless, if you don't know that, who does? but baby, it's just not the answer, not at our age. 
speaker2: so what's the answer, baby?
speaker1: ã¢â€â¢ someplace you can belch without saying excuse me!
speaker2: i can do that in the steam room at the ymca.
speaker1: and if a little monkey business comes along, whose gonna throw rocks? you and polo were a marvellous looking couple.

speaker1: is there something wrong with being a groovy looking couple? people turning around to stare? what was it, archie? 
speaker2: barney, what would you say if i told you that one day i just got very tired of being married?

speaker1: i don't know what i want. to feel something, 
speaker2: that's no answer; archie, grow up!
speaker2: archie, what am i going to do about wilma?

speaker1: hey, you. 
speaker2: i'm drunk.
speaker1: it's the stuff barney gave you.
speaker2: i'm drunk.
speaker1: i'll drive you home.
speaker2: thank you, i'll take the bus.

speaker1: don't be silly. 
speaker2: don't pry, archie.
speaker1: how'm i prying?
speaker2: i'll go home by bus.
speaker1: if i were prying, i would ask you how you broke your rib. right?
speaker3: you fall on a tuba and you break your rib. right.
speaker1: wrong. the rib was broken hours before your fall.

speaker1: anytime you're ready, lady. 
speaker2: i'll keep it for you.
speaker3: it has to be returned. "friends of the evergreen," archie looks blank.
speaker3: it's a lodge. in chinatown. on grant. ask for mr. howard.
speaker2: petulia, take a cab!
speaker4: don't pry, archie:

speaker1: will you remember that? "friends of the evergreen." 
speaker2: petulia, where are you going?
speaker1: mr. howard. tell him i'm sorry i goofed. archie, you know something? the tuba makes you look ten years younger, and . you'know ... thingy

speaker1: petulia? 
speaker2: hi.
speaker1: you okay?
speaker2: uh huh.
speaker1: sure?
speaker2: of course.
speaker1: just before ---

speaker1: i'm fine. 
speaker2: ... for a split second there
speaker1: ism okay.
speaker2: i thought maybe you
speaker1: david.

speaker1: hi, polo. 
speaker2: it's very nice.
speaker2: i've never been here before.
speaker1: thanks.
speaker2: it's strange, coming into your husband's bachelor apartment for the first time. feels slightly illegal. is that a tuba?

speaker1: that's a tuba. 
speaker2: make a marvelous lamp.
speaker1: you just had to say it.
speaker2: predictable polo.
speaker1: "predictable polo." has a certain zing.
speaker2: looking forward to the weekend. lest i forget
speaker2: as usual, i baked enough for an army.
speaker1: okay.

speaker1: this is very strange. i didntt think i'd feel like this. mostly sad. 
speaker2: you need anything, polo?
speaker1: no. well, yes. well, yes and no.
speaker2: i think that covers all the possibilities.
speaker1: it's such a puzzle. we really got on so marvelously. never fought. never screamed at each other. not once.
speaker1: everybody we knew envied us.
speaker2: we were a handsome couple.
speaker1: i think i've fallen in love. the man is warren smith. he's an engineer and very good with the children, but he wants to go back to school and get his masters in hydraulics. well, say something.
speaker2: i think that's fine, polo.

speaker1: tie phone begins ringing. archie crosses to it. 
speaker2: hello? hello?
speaker3: were going to'be married.
speaker2: great. hello?

speaker1: come on, let's eat. morrie finally got a shipment of dungeness crab. 
speaker2: about time.
speaker1: well, poor guy. they had all that trouble.

speaker1: ã¢â€â¢ 32 continued archie sees her. looking at his bed. 
speaker2: so the kids like him, eh?
speaker3: adore him.
speaker2: how about that?
speaker3: don't you have maid service?
speaker2: what the are you doing, bringing me cookies?
speaker4: ã¢â€â¢
speaker2: what's so great about not fighting?
speaker3: i came to tell you about warren,
speaker2: you told me about warren.
speaker2: warren is working for his m'tstah's in hydraulics.

speaker1: , ., at the house. i mean until warren 
speaker2: and i get married, which won't be
speaker3: by now, entirely out of habit, archie's hand has
speaker4: until he is established with some hydraulics firma i hope it won't be too long, i mean for everybody's sake.
speaker5: if he's a bright guy, he'll make out okay.
speaker4: needless to say there are certain problems.

speaker1: 32b continued 
speaker2: he lives in such a depressing, rented room. it gives me claustrophobia.
speaker3: poor polo.
speaker2: it's such an icky little room.
speaker3: tell the kids i'll come for them 0 sunday at eight.
speaker2: they'll be ready. i thought the decent thing was to come here and talk in a civilized manner. about the change in my situation.
speaker3: i appreciate it, polo.
speaker2: good night, archie.
speaker3: you've got a run in your stocking.

speaker1: now you folks keep moving along that bridge. you keep moving along and give other folks a chance. there's lots of pretty things to do. you keep moving right along. you won't want to forget our niponese souvenir pagoda where every item is the real mccoy. that's right. keep moving, that's the ticket. sergeant, you've been standing there some time now. during this, may and archie talk. '.s 32 and pretty. its a nice day but archie is not happy. polo, warren, maybe petulia mostly it's kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor, . and may have been sitting on the grass. gracefully she rises to her feet, doing everything just right, even this. 
speaker2: nobody in the world can sit on the grass and not wrinkle.
speaker2: no, perfect. not even a blade of grass. why don't i marry you, may?
speaker3: why don't you, ar^hie?
speaker2: tell me about bobby kennedy.
speaker2: picasso? pickles?

speaker1: choose a subject. ice cubes. any thing. take either side. talk for thirty seconds against ice cubes. 
speaker2: why the hostility, archie?
speaker1: that dress shop of yours. "boutique." i've never seen one of those ... your rubber mannequins .. i've never once seen the pipe sticking out of their bottoms. not once, not one time. that bothers me, may.
speaker1: i'm not hostile, it's frustration. in all that perfection, how could a clumsy clot like me possibly be fitted in? i mean, without spoiling the whole effect.
speaker2: don't worry about it. you'll be going back to polo.
speaker1: no, she's found a fellah.
speaker2: oh.
speaker2: i'd just about given up on you,
speaker1: what i should do is marry you.
speaker3: thoroughly annoyed.

speaker1: archie, if it would please you, i'll submit a list of my faults, some of which might shake you up a bit. 
speaker2: it would be a fake list.
speaker3: probably, it wouldn't be a fake list. actually, i wear arch supports, my depilatory causes a nasty little rash, and i've lost 10% of my hearing in less than a year .. okay?

speaker1: well of all people. 
speaker2: all that about the humanitarian- ism of the medical profession.
speaker1: don't ask.
speaker2: archie, this is mr. howard.
speaker3: i was looking at the foundation. once in a while you find one from before the earthquake. it's a thrill, believe you me.

speaker1: 0 3l1. continued 
speaker2: mr. howard is the'watchman for the "friends of the evergreen." or was.
speaker3: the tuba.
speaker2: no wonder people are becoming cynical about doctors.
speaker3: i tried to return it. the place was locked.
speaker4: no harm done,
speaker2: ã¢â€â¢ i didn't expect this of you, archie'.
speaker3: i tried to return the tuba friday

speaker1: it's o.k. 
speaker2: accusingly to
speaker3: the "friends of the evergreen" are very proud of their brass band.
speaker1: all's well that ends well.
speaker2: stay out of this, mr. howard.
speaker2: i'm petulia danner. i'm sorry about this.

speaker1: all that broken glass 
speaker2: its okay.
speaker1: goodbye, mr. howard. goodbye, petulia.

speaker1: take a taxi. you can at least say you're sorry, archie. 
speaker2: i'm sorry, mr, howard. goodbye, petulia.
speaker2: what's the next move, petulia?
speaker1: i'd like to discuss your irresponsibility. people are passing in the hallway, peering in.
speaker2: goodbye, petulia.

speaker1: i should explain about petuliaa she is a kook. we are going to be married. 
speaker2: archie, when you try to sound cool and "with it," you're really pathetic. we're trying to have an intelligent conversation...
speaker1: about what?
speaker2: well, about polo, among other things.
speaker1: polo is none of your business.
speaker2: that's dumb. dumb. she's my business and she's this lady's business. i happen to hate polo.
speaker1: needless to say she's never even met polo.
speaker2: i look at you and i know polo. explain that to him.
speaker2: how many years were you married., archie? eight? ten? anyhow, the best, wasted. gone down the drain.
speaker1: oh, come on ..o
speaker2: archie, we are from two different worlds. we've got nothing to agree on. except one thing. you're a lonely screwed up mess. 0 archie, i'm trying to save you. you're a very special man.

speaker1: oh, 
speaker2: tell him, may.
speaker2: you don't think so?
speaker3: i won't put archie on a pedestal. he'll do.
speaker2: you've got yourself another winner, archie.
speaker3: it's a joke, you're both putting me on.
speaker4: petulia. i mean it. tubas. all this e "i love lucy" jazz. it's only cute for awhile.
speaker2: it's not meant to be cute. i'm fighting for your life.
speaker1: who's trying to kill me?
speaker3: the two million, five hundred thousand subscribers to the "ladies home journal" ... right, dear?
speaker1: petulia, go home and save what's his name. i really don't want to see you anymore.

speaker1: i 36 continued 
speaker2: hi.
speaker3: you're kidding.
speaker4: i think i've discovered a cure for cancer.
speaker3: well, if you're on the brink of something. how did they let you in.
speaker5: she joins him.
speaker4: you look exhausted.
speaker3: do you know it's almost three? doesn't
speaker4: look at you.

speaker1: petulia, you've got to stop following me around like this. 
speaker1: where to? i could use a steak sandwich. there's a jazz joint that stays open all night.
speaker1: hey, come on ã‚â®m why this sudden
speaker1: no.
speaker2: yes.
speaker3: not here.

speaker1: ã¢â€â¢ 39 continued 
speaker2: it m not really hungry.
speaker3: i'm starving.
speaker2: am i being punished?
speaker3: loganberry jam ... we'll have a case.
speaker2: i'd rather have a new plastic raincoat.
speaker3: you don't save anything on plastic raincoats.
speaker2: shall i get another cart? polo can fill three or four when she really puts her mind to it.
speaker4: in the long line before the cashier.
speaker5: you know what time it is? it's after fivb.
speaker3: ilia sorry.
speaker5: i want to go to bed.
speaker3: so do we.

speaker1: well, we knocked off another one. another notch in the old stethoscope. 
speaker2: you're a wonderful doctor, archie.
speaker1: i keep a little black bow tie in my desk. in

speaker2: have to pick up the, kids, i'm already late.
speaker1: you're not abandoning me? i mean, i wasn't all that bad, was i?
speaker3: amateur night, he leans over and kisses her mouth.
speaker1: before i've brushed my teeth? are you a communist, archie?
speaker2: i guess so
speaker1: tell mike to watch that weight.

speaker1: will you be here when i get back? 
speaker2: archie. dumb.
speaker2: yes?

speaker1: i'm divorcing david, if that's what you mean, 
speaker2: that's none of my business.

speaker1: hey,, you.
speaker1: don't have any illusions about all those groceries. i can't cook.
speaker2: and you hate loganberry jam.
speaker1: no, as a matter of fact, i rather like it. he smiles, continues out.

speaker1: phone.

speaker1: hi, shut up, you guys, 
speaker2: hi. what's all the noise?
speaker1: mike.
speaker3: fat mike?
speaker1: he's not all that fat.

speaker1: i called you stevie two weeks ago -e we were all calling you stevie two weeks ago -- i was. 
speaker2: before that.

speaker1: never. the brightest. i used to have such terrible anxiety that i would die suddenly. before i could say thank you, archie is very touched. 
speaker2: i have to go to. the latrine.

speaker1: she's not going to die. 
speaker2: what a shame.
speaker1: she has her first visitor. mr. danner.
speaker1: "his mastahs in'hydraul:ics."

speaker1: in the hospital of my dreams people won't be chased out like sheep. people are better than most of the medicines they give you. david has finally'got around to repairing that wharf. he hired a couple of boys. the three of them are really working up a sweat. he's thinking of sailing all the way down the coast to lima. that's in peru. 
speaker1: they say lima is a terrific city. if you watch out for flies and take sensible sanitary precautions. i'll tell you a secret but don't you snitch: i'm using propaganda on david so that the four of 0 us can go. mother's a better sailor than i am. even though i served eighteen months on a mine sweeper. which should have prepared me for anything.

speaker1: 79d continued a nun looks in. 
speaker2: visiting hours are over.
speaker3: i had lunch with your mr. pearl less than two weeks ago; the nun looks blank.
speaker3: mr. pearl happens to be the superintendent of this hospital; two weeks ago at the blue fox restaurants just the six of usl

speaker1: i'm sorry sir, but it's time for the lady's medication. 
speaker2: does anyone ever report how filthy this room is?
speaker3: look at this'. look at this! i personally raised fifty thousand dollars for this hospital during the last campaign. you didn't know that did you; well ask mr, pearl'. i mean if you knew what he looked like'. filthy'.
speaker4: without even looking at him:
speaker5: tell david, it's alright. he can come out of the cupboard.
speaker2: chin up'.

speaker1: i'm not sick! don't waste time on me! 
speaker2: where is she?
speaker3: mrs. danner? they picked her up. dr. worthington said it was alright so long as she had proper nursing.
speaker2: who picked her up.
speaker3: her husband i suppose.

speaker1: they had a long talk with dr. worthington. he seemed entirely satisfied. 
speaker2: they kidnapped hero
speaker3: take care of the sick people! i'm in tip-top shape!

speaker1: hi archie.

speaker2: our young lady is doing nicely. we have a few problems, but nothing serious.
speaker1: ã¢â€â¢ i get hiccups.` i go along merrily hiccupping for hours on end.
speaker3: why did you leave the hospital?
speaker1: i was feeling ever so much better, archie.
speaker4: will you be staying for lunch, sir?
speaker1: you two haven't met. this is dr. bollen.

speaker1: yes, i thought so. hello, there! 
speaker2: i want you to go back to the hospital.
speaker1: dr. worthington says she's doing fine.
speaker3: he's very good about that.
speaker2: petulia _mã‚â® !

speaker1: well, you're finally meeting our whole family. 
speaker2: dr. bollen, i wouldn't exactly call this good taste. not to mention medical ethics.
speaker3: dad, you old fuddy-duddy, things happen.
speaker4: you told the policeman you had a dizzy spell.
speaker1: right. i fell on my bottom.

speaker1: you were beaten up. you were somebody's punching bag. 
speaker2: won't have you cross-examining this girl.
speaker3: your son nearly killed this girl.
speaker4: hey now listen, doe, i'll stand still for only so much.
speaker2: i want you to remember what this man just said. though it's none of your business, my boy was in baton rouge, louisiana.
speaker5: we've decided we're quite happy with the one we have.
speaker4: when dad phoned me i was having dinner with a cousin of ours. real mouth- watering creole cooking.
speaker5: i'm fine archie. except i burp a lot. everybody gets dizzy spells.

speaker1: where else could i go? a lonely hotel room? i don't have a penny of my own. mr. danner promised me i'd never be left alone. i thought i'd try it for a few days. don't be-angry. it was nobody's fault. actually, if anyone is to blame, it's you, archie. 
speaker2: me?i.o

speaker1: 87b continued archie is stunned. 
speaker2: i'm looking for the ticket for my raincoat.

speaker1: 9 why didn't you bring a proper ambulance? as though you really meant it. 
speaker2: i didn't know what to do. i was going from one moment to the next.
speaker1: spectacular entrance, lousy exit. sounds familiar, archie. suddenly all the anger goes out of petulia.

speaker1: 87e continued 
speaker2: look at him. isn't he super. a six foot three coca cola bottle. empty. i did that. i'd ruin you, archie.

speaker1: it's never too soon to think of the boys' education.

speaker3: oh yes, fine.

speaker1: no, you're wrong. its not petulia. two elderly

speaker1: wonderful. i.sn g t - t ? they sell like hot cakes. gives you something alive in all this stone. 
speaker2: there must be some mistake.
speaker1: mac and i get a, big kick out of people's first reaction. its not a toy. it's a working greenhouse. you control heat and humidity with these. you've got a little bit of everything. ornamental plants,, zinnias, asters. even a little vegetable garden. the most important thing to remember is to keep the sun out. these new kind of lights work so much better, there's no comparison.

speaker1: you've got the wrong apartment l 
speaker2: no we have not s dr. bollen3
speaker1: what screwball ...?i then he stops, he knows what screwball.
