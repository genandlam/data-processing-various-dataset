speaker1: how we doing? 
speaker2: we'll see...
speaker3: a voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.
speaker4: strickler's disease crept into manhattan like a thief in the night, claiming its first hundred victims before it was even classified.
speaker4: most were children under ten.

speaker1: only after the numbers had reached into the thousands were officials able to identify the carrier of the deadly infection... 
speaker2: cut to three.
speaker1: blattida germanica. the common cockroach.
speaker2: tell them we're ready for a live feed.

speaker1: ...an insect that has proven virtually immune to chemical control... 
speaker2: ...the announcement by the health department that an end to the nightmare has finally...
speaker3: ...an ex-colleague of doctor susan wyeth...
speaker4: ...susan has always been opposed to biological tampering. a real advocate for ecological causes, it's not...

speaker1: with the aid of genetic labs throughout the country, we recombined cockroach dna with genetic information from termites and mantids. we were able to create a biological counter-agent. a new ally, if you will... 
speaker1: blattida traditor.

speaker1: the "judas roach". 
speaker1: the judas is a non-carrier of stricklers, with a short life-span and heightened pheromone emission.
speaker1: the female is basically a sexual magnet; common males travelled miles and fought for the right to mate with them. the audience is rapt.
speaker1: when they did, they took away something else we added -- a hormone, passed through sexual congress that causes their metabolism to go into overdrive. no matter what their food intake, they starved to death in a matter of hours.
speaker2: we've achieved almost total eradication of the roach population. as of today, the disease has been officially contained.

speaker1: life's a our 15 minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable... 
speaker1: hiding from the hard glare of publicity?
speaker1: a shame. you looked great tonight.
speaker2: please.
speaker1: you did!
speaker2: do you think we did the right thing?
speaker1: taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
speaker2: you know what i mean...
speaker2: we did no impact evaluation. the consequences of...
speaker1: is this a catholic guilt thing...?

speaker1: you hear that? flawless. 
speaker2: we just don't know.
speaker1: we know we saved lives.
speaker1: there're gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you.
speaker1: who know? we get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
speaker2: we're down to a "couple" now, huh?
speaker1: oh, i don't know. people are beginning to talk about us...
speaker2: don't worry, i'll save your honor. maybe i'll even marry you.

speaker1: watches, still fascinated. 
speaker1: funny, funny shoes...

speaker1: ...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly. no spaces in between. let me tell you why. insects have no hands. all they have is this set of mandibles. 
speaker1: see? this little piggy will grab the prey.
speaker1: then this little piggy will tear it in half...
speaker1: ...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth. these are precision tools here. can you remember that?
speaker1: good. then get it right.

speaker1: "baby in a bottle..." he gives it to susan. 
speaker2: don't tease.
speaker1: you know where they get this fertility stuff? they extract it from the urine of menopausal italian nuns.
speaker2: monks bottle their own wine. don't they?
speaker2: trust me. i've never been this late. never.
speaker2: if nun's pee is what it takes...
speaker2: you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
speaker1: don't get here...
speaker1: okay, meet me out front. i gotta go. josh's picking me up in five.
speaker2: i'll be late.
speaker2: siri, sandblast that thing. it looks like trump tower. those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
speaker3: just like trump tower, then.

speaker1: ...so i say "buddy, you have every violation in the book. gimme one good reason not to close you down." you know what the kraut says to me? 
speaker1: the blintzes! "try the blintzes..."
speaker2: selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
speaker1: not just any carbohydrates, mind you. it was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex. we should get a strobe on this thing.
speaker2: yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "epidemic! epidemic! you're all going to die!"

speaker1: health department... 
speaker2: you really love flashing that thing, don't you?
speaker1: hey. i'm a short guy. waddaya want?
speaker2: peter tyler, doh. you gentlemen were the first on the scene?
speaker3: we were both on patrol, saw this paint mess. then i looked through that cellar window. we both did...
speaker2: you gone in?
speaker3: no. we waited.
speaker2: good.
speaker2: get the emt's in there, now.

speaker1:  
speaker2: they look real sick, don't they?

speaker1: ...as long as they're ready for the opening i don't care, just tell them that. 
speaker2: i'm on it. don't worry. look, susan...i don't mean to pry, but... i kinda overheard you and peter.
speaker1: watch your step, siri. your grant could be on the line here.
speaker2: i just...well, i had this cousin in delhi. she was having problems, too.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: she used a baster.
speaker2: not a big one. i mean, it was like a turkey baster.
speaker1: oh,
speaker1: come on, darlin'...
speaker1: what's this?
speaker2: oh, right... they been here since noon. i told them you're real busy.
speaker1: hello.
speaker3: you the bug lady, right?
speaker1: i suppose so.
speaker3: we're here to deal.

speaker1: metaxonycha godmani, trigonopelastes delta. field butterflies. have you been upstate? 
speaker2: avenue b.
speaker1: i guess they got lost in this city.
speaker3: so, you wanna buy em?
speaker2: there's extra wings in the bag.
speaker1: you guys have done a nice job. how bout five dollars?
speaker3: that's it?
speaker2: show her the weirdbug.
speaker3: cost a dollar just to look.
speaker2: it's a great bug. we kinda broke it a little...
speaker1: fellas, i'll tell you what...ten dollars for everything. plus a killing jar, some tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you catch will be in better shape.
speaker2: deal!
speaker3: you crazy! that's the best!!
speaker2: bug's almost dead anyway.
speaker2: thanks, lady.
speaker4: ten dollars?
speaker1: alphabet city kids- there's much worse things they could be selling.
speaker4: i hate this window...

speaker1: internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it. no definite signs of tb, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure. 
speaker2: immigration's gonna love you for that.
speaker1: tell them to send flowers to the usual address.

speaker1: two shifts, people rotating from bed to work. one toilet. we're in wal-mart hell, here. 
speaker2: did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
speaker1: triad, chinese mafia. they bring people from yunan. slave labor... reverend harry wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. no sign of him.
speaker2: tell her she's going to be alright. we'll take care of her.
speaker3: she's delirious. keeps saying the "dark angels" are coming for her. she says they took some of her people away.
speaker2: dark angels?

speaker1: siri? siri?! 
speaker2: ...the
speaker1: can you...?
speaker1: could you...help me...?

speaker1: i'm gonna pull it out and i want you to pin it down, okay? 
speaker2: what is it?
speaker1: i have no idea. are you ready?
speaker2: oh my
speaker2: get it! get it!
speaker1: it bit you.
speaker2: no

speaker1: this wing configuration. i've never... 
speaker2: it broke the skin...
speaker1: and they're not fully developed. this thing's not even an adult.
speaker1: my
speaker2: what?

speaker1: it's breathing. 
speaker2: shakes her head.
speaker2: that's impossible. insects don't...
speaker1: i know. help me get a sample. susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg. the nymph clicks nervously.
speaker1: hold on, big guy, hold on...

speaker1: hold on a second... 
speaker2: what?

speaker1: he lowers himself with silent grace. 
speaker2: susan?
speaker3: call security.

speaker1: not too little, not too much. you rub it in, around and around like this. let the leather take it. 
speaker1: you watching? you should learn to work the shoes. you're good with your hands...
speaker1: chuy...you gonna get all wet.
speaker1: did you look at the story book i got you?
speaker1: our animal friends. can you say that, chico? "friends"?

speaker1: a friend is the one you can trust. when you are with a friend, no matter where in the world, you are at home. 
speaker1: in this city. a friend is a hard thing to find...
speaker2: his face shows a bit of animation.
speaker2: funny shoes...
speaker2: alli. mr. funny shoes.

speaker1: no one is there. is empty. 
speaker1: chuy, listen to me. they have on the cross, but that is not a holy place. you understand?
speaker1: ah, nino. only knows what goes on in your head, eh?
speaker2: mr. funny shoes...

speaker1: josh, what was immigration's countdown? 
speaker2: thirty-three workers.
speaker1: there are thirty five listed in the reverend wong's roster...
speaker2: 
speaker1: remember what that woman said, about people being taken? check with the copsin the area.

speaker1: sus? 
speaker1: susan?

speaker1: this thing was the size of my fist, peter!! that's off the charts! 
speaker2: okay. so you lost a great specimen-
speaker1: don't you get it? it's more than that.
speaker1: you know why insects don't grow larger? because they don't have a complex respiratory system. what i saw did. it had lungs.
speaker1: evolution doesn't work that fast. something pushed that thing to take the leap. we need to find another specimen.
speaker2: we?
speaker1: i did a ph test on its tarsal pads.
speaker1: there's only two species who match the enzymes i found. one's a leaf-cutter ant in the amazon...
speaker1: the other we released here two years ago.

speaker1: avenue b... again! maybe you got wrong letter, uh? 
speaker2: keep going. we'll tell you when to stop...
speaker3: maybe they lied to you.
speaker2: even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
speaker4: no... oh, get away, you turk!
speaker2: pull over!
speaker1: what...?

speaker1: metaxonycha godmani. 
speaker2: so?

speaker1: if you want your money back, forget it! 
speaker2: we already spent it!
speaker3: we're here to deal.

speaker1: here, let me... 
speaker2: you sure you didn't see one of these?
speaker3: gross. what is it?
speaker2: an "ootheca". an eggcase. it probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
speaker3: no way. i see one of those, i'd puke.

speaker1: it was in that corner over there. 
speaker2: sucker was fast, man. had to take it out with one a these.
speaker3: okay, guys. we'll take it from here.
speaker2: make it ten an' we won't tell the cops you're here.
speaker3: let's keep it at five and i won't condemn your clubhouse.

speaker1: let me try. my hands are smaller. 
speaker2: face squinches with the effort.
speaker3: honey, just leave it.
speaker1: no, there's...

speaker1: susan's hand is almost there. 
speaker2: reaches further.
speaker3: now don't tell me.
speaker3: you lost a token, right?

speaker1: look, i showed you my badge... 
speaker2: yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. that's the old maintenance grid, doc. swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
speaker1: the department of public health...
speaker2: ...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
speaker1: fine. you want me to call your supervisor?
speaker2: please do. he's a lonely guy.

speaker1: your shoes. 
speaker2: that's wonderful! what grade are you in?
speaker1: no school. shoes're all chuy knows about. ernest discreetly points to his forehead.
speaker3: he's special.
speaker4: he can imitate anything, you just watch him.
speaker5: excuse me, i'm talking to you.
speaker4: no, you talkin' at me.
speaker1: is there some reward for this?
speaker2: i guess that could be arranged.
speaker5: for chrissakes. you gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
speaker4: you wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude. leonard saunters away with ernest in tow.

speaker1: you give someone a uniform and... did you hear how he talked to us? 
speaker2: i heard how you talked to him.
speaker1: oh, so i'm the bad guy now?
speaker2: he was just doing his job.
speaker1: fine, then i'm the bad guy.
speaker1: he wants a permit, i'll get him a permit.

speaker1: chrissakes... 
speaker1: guys, c'mon.
speaker1: i told you to stick by the maintenance area.
speaker2: nah... it's private property now.
speaker3: he eats down there.
speaker1: who?
speaker4: the stickman.
speaker2: long john.
speaker1: graffiti artist, uh?

speaker1: squinting to see over his flashlight beam. 
speaker2: hey, buddy!
speaker2: get off my track...

speaker1: heya. where's the boss? siri gestures to the far end of the room. susan stands alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ant mound exhibit. 
speaker2: ant mound.
speaker1: you okay?
speaker2: it's just a headache. we were sandblasting trump tower here since four this morning.
speaker1: maybe you should sit...
speaker2: i'm fine. go talk to susan. she could use a good word right now. she nods for him to go ahead. peter leaves.

speaker1: great crowd. 
speaker2: no such thing, baby.
speaker2: i get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
speaker1: 'em. they don't know what they're missing.
speaker2: right.
speaker1: what's wrong?
speaker2: oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. least that's what i thought.
speaker1: oh, no, you were-
speaker2: i was just late.
speaker2: ironic, don't you think? these guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? and here we are...
speaker1: susan, we're not b-
speaker3: susan?
speaker2: siri... siri collapses. the exhibit tips over. peter pulls susan out of the way just as the exhibit

speaker1: ...i think it's some kind of systemic infection, chris. i saw a few cases like it yesterday. a sweatshop in canal. 
speaker2: okay, look. you better come in with me. help me through.

speaker1: all hands on deck, pete. remember the dril? 
speaker2: it'll come back to me.
speaker2: looks like a lyme disease rash.
speaker1: it's not consistent with the internal bleeding. any idea what bit her?
speaker1: i think we're gonna need to have that specimen here.

speaker1: stares without emotion at the plaster figure. movement to his side. he turns again. a dimly-lit figure stands before him. 
speaker1: mr. funny shoes.

speaker1: ...you don't even know what you're looking for. 
speaker2: you said that thing was big as your hand. i don't think i'm going to miss...
speaker1: why take the chance? just let me go down there with you...
speaker2: no.
speaker2: susan, listen to me: you handled that insect almost as much as siri...
speaker1: it didn't bite me.
speaker2: i know. but if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
speaker2: chris is going to run some blood tests on you. i want you to stay here till he's absolutely sure you're clean. okay? then you'll call me... you'll catch up with us...
speaker2: we'll be all right, sus. i promise.

speaker1: my father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get a pitcher. cold water, whoosh, i tell you that's some alarm clock, brrrrr! 
speaker1: ah! there you go! the way you like 'em, chu-chu... we're low on milk, you remind grampa to pick some up tonight, okay?

speaker1: what's the problem? 
speaker2: i think it's a baby!

speaker1: how you feeling? 
speaker2: you tell me.
speaker1: your blood tests were all negative. you checked out.
speaker2: what about siri?
speaker1: she's stable. i don't think there's any immediate danger, but we'll have to keep her under observation...
speaker2: you think it's some form of strickler's, don't you?
speaker1: pathology's still working on the tissue samples. if it is...it must be an errant strain. shorter incubation period. i'm sorry, sue. we just don't know yet.

speaker1: ...how many times i gotta tell you, man: we can't accept this! 
speaker2: well, what the else am i suppose to do with it?

speaker1: take it out back and throw it in the friggin' dumpster! 
speaker2: not unless somebody signs for it.
speaker3: oh, my
speaker1: hey, you can't...
speaker3: what's your name?
speaker1: jeremy...
speaker3: okay, jeremy...go get dr. chris raymond, will you?
speaker1: lady...
speaker3: did you hear me? get dr. raymond!

speaker1: okay. jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall. 
speaker2: where'd you find it?
speaker3: washed up at the filtration plant on bank street. some there thought it was a baby. they called us.
speaker3: it's a lobster, right?

speaker1: better hurry it up, doc. my shift's almost over. 
speaker2: guess someone requested you for overtime...buddy.

speaker1: posterior sternites are gone...half the protonum rotted off. 
speaker2: maggots...
speaker1: near hatching. thing must've died about three weeks ago. susan closes the mandibles and examines them.
speaker1: do you have a polaroid?

speaker1: you all watch your step. we got some burrows goin' down seven stories here. you fall, i don't wanna have to come pick you up. 
speaker2: new york's finest.
speaker2: there's really people living down here?
speaker1: mole people. this section was pretty popular, all the way to fulton street...
speaker1: substance abusers, mental cases... then about a year ago, poof! all gone. rumors got started... someone found a couple of stiffs...
speaker1: down here's the land of talk, see? so the wildest version goes the farthest. they mark that area with a sign or a drawing, and its as good as closed. we had one fella... for years said he was bela lugosi. got him on geraldo.

speaker1: it's me. can you hear me? 
speaker2: yeah, barely. we haven't found anything down here. nothing...
speaker1: i have.
speaker1: i'm on my way. i've got something for you to look at...

speaker1: we'll be back at the platform in... 
speaker2: 20 minutes. if you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
speaker1: 20 minutes. susan?
speaker2: funny. shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
speaker3: what?
speaker2: track bunnies. rats. they're usually around.

speaker1: no, no, please understand... i can't wait that long. 
speaker1: please. i write it down. 2... 8... 7... 3. what does this mean "case number"? okay. so, now what? when can you...?
speaker1: no, i can't wait...no, listen...
speaker1: hijos de puta.

speaker1: smells like acid. 
speaker2: ammonia.

speaker1: peter... 
speaker2: yeah...?
speaker1: there's some weird here.
speaker2: weird shit...?
speaker1: take a look.
speaker1: matter, unknown origin: weird whatever it is, it's not human.
speaker3: and it needs some metamucil.

speaker1: hey, lady, all power will be down in five minutes, okay? 
speaker2: okay....
speaker3: the closed jaws. they look like a human face.

speaker1: peter? 
speaker2: the man's face tips back...
speaker3: its multi-parted mouth clicks open. susan screams!

speaker1: fifteen feet below. 
speaker2: i've never been this deep. this area here is the old armory station. they built it in the 40's. ran out of money half-way through...
speaker2: okay, the fat lady's singing. time to go. everything is gray with dust.

speaker1: don't!! 
speaker2: did you see the size of that thing?!
speaker1: look what you did! you stupid sonofa-

speaker1: rushes forward. 
speaker1: peter!

speaker1: it's okay. i'm all right. 
speaker2: get the away from me!
speaker1: he's all right, too.
speaker2: oh, that's gonna work.
speaker1: you got a better way up?
speaker2: show that to the station manager. tell him leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
speaker3: h-how do i get...?
speaker2: way we came. take the first tunnel to your right...
speaker2: go left. go left again till you hit the fork... then right again. you got that?
speaker3: i think so. one right, two lefts...
speaker2: and a right.
speaker3: right.
speaker1: go josh. now.

speaker1: any luck? 
speaker2: well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks. ain't gonna be much use, though. lines are dead.
speaker1: you said those cables're still live.
speaker2: oh, man, there you go again.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: those things bring juice to the new stations. you just can't rewire that
speaker1: for chrissakes, what's the problem?
speaker2: all right, that's it.
speaker1: shh! shh!
speaker2: manny?!
speaker2: my what the are you...?
speaker3: hurry, the woman needs help!
speaker1: woman?

speaker1: don't. 
speaker2: listen to me: we're getting you out.
speaker2: give me your belts.
speaker3: what are you doing down here?
speaker4: chuy. he was taken. he's down here somewhere... oh, please, hurry. i saw what was after her.
speaker2: what's...?
speaker4: just hurry.
speaker2: i'm coming, sus, i'm coming.

speaker1: no, no. 
speaker2: toss the flare down!
speaker3: i only got...
speaker2: just do it!

speaker1: eyes grow huge. 
speaker2: oh, jesus...
speaker3: just plain loses it.
speaker3: what the is that?! what the is that?!
speaker4: knows all too well what's coming for her.
speaker4: peter...
speaker2: wrap it around your hand!
speaker2: come on!
speaker2: get on my shoulders!

speaker1: get the goddam door! 
speaker2: push it! push it! don't let up!

speaker1: what the was that? 
speaker1: you better tell me what the hell's going on here!
speaker2: hey, hey!! take it easy!!
speaker3: wait a minute-
speaker1: you, wait a minute. i'm going to-

speaker1: its muscles are locked. 
speaker2: oh, jesus!!
speaker3: wait...
speaker2: oh, it's hitting the bone man, get it off!!
speaker1: hey hey hey...
speaker3: is how we make loose the ticks back home.

speaker1: just keep holding it. can you do that for me? susan? 
speaker2: doctor tyler?
speaker1: you feel anything?
speaker3: yeah, i feel like ripping your eyes out...
speaker1: leonard, listen. i need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. look, i'm trying to help you here...
speaker3: oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. you and your goddam memo. you needed to prove your point, uh?
speaker1: i'm sorry. but i don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
speaker2: where the hell'd that thing come from?
speaker1: a mistake.
speaker3: "mistake"? what's that supposed to...?
speaker1: it doesn't matter, all right? it's dead.
speaker3: how you know that? it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a pipe through its heart...
speaker4: it doesn't have a heart.
speaker4: just inner chambers...
speaker2: but it look like a man. it... i saw it.
speaker4: no...
speaker4: that's what it wanted you to see.

speaker1: so, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or... 
speaker2: that's camouflage...
speaker2: this is mimicry. they evolve to mimic their predators. a butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl. a catterpillar can copy a snake...
speaker2: this has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator it's ever had...
speaker2: us.

speaker1: mantids can mimic. we gave the judas that code... 
speaker2: "...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
speaker1: this, is our baby peter. yours and mine. aren't you proud?

speaker1: all these...they're like tunnels of an insect colony. once these things hit a certain population density, they'll have to move out, form new colonies. 
speaker1: we have to get help down here. burn the tunnels before...
speaker2: get the doors!
speaker3: is there a switch?
speaker2: third rail is dead. get me up. there must be a manual override in the booth.
speaker1: the lights! peter turns off the flashlights.

speaker1: where's the crank?! 
speaker2: the mimic is only yards away.

speaker1: they're coming! 
speaker2: the shadows get nearer, their clicking louder...

speaker1: i got it! 
speaker1: hurry! please!
speaker2: the doors begin to swing shut very slowly.
speaker3: sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.

speaker1: come on, you son-of-a... 
speaker2: a soft click as the doors shut in unison. silence.

speaker1: his blood! it's driving them crazy! we have to mask the odor! 
speaker2: how?!
speaker2: it's no use! they know we're in here!
speaker1: they don't know anything peter, they just sense. they're hardwired!
speaker2: right. hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
speaker1: exac...
speaker1: give me your razor.
speaker2: what are you doing?
speaker3: 
speaker1: rub it on the windows!
speaker2: what-
speaker1: just do it!!
speaker4: looks to the roof, listening.

speaker1: what are you putting that on me for? 
speaker2: scent glands. insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.

speaker1: okay. that's us. 
speaker1: this track we're on? goes down into the repair area. the elevator's over here. leads up to the active tunnels.
speaker2: can we get this car there?
speaker1: someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
speaker3: but the power...
speaker1: hell, i might be able to juice the whole area, if i can get to the power box. it's just a couple of cables...
speaker4: oh, how you gonna get there, leonard?
speaker2: just talk me through it. i can go with manny.
speaker1: it would take a minute or so. you won't last that long out there.
speaker3: peter, you couldn't even fix our tv!
speaker2: we'll cover ourselves with this. they can mimic us- we goddam mimic them!
speaker3: peter-
speaker2: it worked before...
speaker3: the scent won't last...
speaker2: that's why we should do it now.

speaker1: it's just a regular old pump switch, okay? right by the track signal board. 
speaker1: the lights come up, you pull the switch.
speaker2: i pull.
speaker1: you don't do that, we're on the wrong track. you...
speaker1: you gonna finally get to around with the wires. think you can handle it?
speaker3: depends. you got a memo?
speaker1: all right then. you gonna find two wires. one's green. the other's blue...

speaker1: he's out there. i heard him. how can he be? this things... 
speaker2: manny...
speaker1: i didn't protect him, lady. he trusted me. and i didn't protect him... his father...i lost his father to the streets and now, chuy...
speaker2: we'll find him. we'll be back and find him.

speaker1: you're going to have to keep it really slow. their eyes react to sudden movements. 
speaker1: don't touch it. and for godsakes, try not to sweat. they can sense chemical changes...
speaker2: try not to sweat?
speaker3: okay, people... leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.
speaker3: ...are we ready for this?
speaker3: whatever you do, don't step on the third rail coming back. six hundred volts'll blow your leg right off.
speaker2: i was just thinking how i could use a pair of pliers... and i remembered where they are...
speaker1: that's it. that's it. breathe easy.
speaker2: in the tool box under the kitchen counter... susan kisses him softly on the lips. manny approaches. show time.
speaker1: open it.
speaker3: begins turning the lever crank slowly.

speaker1: peter gets to the track. he turns and is met face to face with a mimic! its antennae move toward his head, curious. 
speaker2: leonard has now fully opened the doors.

speaker1: susan watches in disgust. 
speaker2: choke on it, motherfuckers.
speaker3: breathes a sigh of relief. he goes to the powerbox, opens it up.

speaker1: nino... 
speaker1: chuy...

speaker1:  
speaker2: beads of sweat begin to form.
speaker3: susan watches the mimics at their feast.
speaker4: the scent's fading...
speaker5: what's manny doing? i can't see him anymore.

speaker1: nino, please... 
speaker1: dios mio...
speaker1: chuy...
speaker2: friends.

speaker1: friends. 
speaker1: plays his spoons in perfect imitation.

speaker1: has closed his eyes. this, he cannot see... 
speaker2: some mimics advance toward peter's direction.

speaker1: hears the sound of spoons playing. 
speaker1: manny...

speaker1: the doors open. 
speaker2: peter!!
speaker3: come on, kid...
speaker3: 
speaker2: run!! peter!!
speaker4: jump and land

speaker1: the kid... 
speaker2: the kid's with them!!
speaker1: what do you-?
speaker2: go!! just go!!

speaker1: jolts into action. 
speaker2: the train lurches forward.
speaker3: changes position and charges towards the car.

speaker1: leonard's eyes go wide as he sees 
speaker2: he didn't do it!
speaker3: what?
speaker2: manny never threw the coupling switch!!

speaker1: leonard pulls 
speaker2: but they don't work at all.

speaker1: you all right? 
speaker2: can't feel it.
speaker3: they move unsteadily outside.
speaker1: which way?
speaker2: across both tracks!!
speaker4: 
speaker5: the mimics and the albino moving closer.

speaker1: lemme go. 
speaker2: we're no leaving you!
speaker1: no way we can outrun 'em together. move it!
speaker1: now!! go!! get the off my beat! leonard turns away from them.
speaker1: come on. come to poppa.
speaker1: takes a stand by the third rail, baton in hand.
speaker2: there.
speaker3: they rush toward it.

speaker1: come here, you mealy-mouthed... 
speaker1: multi-legged...
speaker1: maggot-munchin' motherfu...

speaker1: i can't tell if it's working! 
speaker1: looks up, into the shaft.
speaker2: coming down, but it's taking its own sweet time.
speaker1: oh, come on, come on!
speaker3: jump in.

speaker1: you go first. i'll be right below you. 
speaker2: your arm, you can't...
speaker1: i can. we can do this...

speaker1: don't hold your breath! keep it going, even flow! 
speaker1: c'mon...
speaker2: ah...
speaker1: talk to me.
speaker2: peter...

speaker1: hang onto me.

speaker1: turn back... 
speaker2: no...
speaker3: we can do it!

speaker1: it'll be fine... it... they're still down there. we'll seal the whole system, go in with whatever it takes...
