PETER: how we doing? 
SUSAN: we'll see...
THE SCREEN. DARKNESS.: a voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.
ANCHORMAN: strickler's disease crept into manhattan like a thief in the night, claiming its first hundred victims before it was even classified.
ANCHORMAN: most were children under ten.

ANCHORMAN: only after the numbers had reached into the thousands were officials able to identify the carrier of the deadly infection... 
DIRECTOR: cut to three.
ANCHORMAN: blattida germanica. the common cockroach.
DIRECTOR: tell them we're ready for a live feed.

REPORTER 1: ...an insect that has proven virtually immune to chemical control... 
REPORTER 2: ...the announcement by the health department that an end to the nightmare has finally...
REPORTER 3: ...an ex-colleague of doctor susan wyeth...
PROTESTER: ...susan has always been opposed to biological tampering. a real advocate for ecological causes, it's not...

SUSAN: with the aid of genetic labs throughout the country, we recombined cockroach dna with genetic information from termites and mantids. we were able to create a biological counter-agent. a new ally, if you will... 
SUSAN: blattida traditor.

SUSAN: the "judas roach". 
SUSAN: the judas is a non-carrier of stricklers, with a short life-span and heightened pheromone emission.
SUSAN: the female is basically a sexual magnet; common males travelled miles and fought for the right to mate with them. the audience is rapt.
SUSAN: when they did, they took away something else we added -- a hormone, passed through sexual congress that causes their metabolism to go into overdrive. no matter what their food intake, they starved to death in a matter of hours.
PETER: we've achieved almost total eradication of the roach population. as of today, the disease has been officially contained.

PETER: life's a our 15 minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable... 
PETER: hiding from the hard glare of publicity?
PETER: a shame. you looked great tonight.
SUSAN: please.
PETER: you did!
SUSAN: do you think we did the right thing?
PETER: taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
SUSAN: you know what i mean...
SUSAN: we did no impact evaluation. the consequences of...
PETER: is this a catholic guilt thing...?

PETER: you hear that? flawless. 
SUSAN: we just don't know.
PETER: we know we saved lives.
PETER: there're gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you.
PETER: who know? we get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
SUSAN: we're down to a "couple" now, huh?
PETER: oh, i don't know. people are beginning to talk about us...
SUSAN: don't worry, i'll save your honor. maybe i'll even marry you.

CHUY: watches, still fascinated. 
CHUY: funny, funny shoes...

SUSAN: ...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly. no spaces in between. let me tell you why. insects have no hands. all they have is this set of mandibles. 
SUSAN: see? this little piggy will grab the prey.
SUSAN: then this little piggy will tear it in half...
SUSAN: ...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth. these are precision tools here. can you remember that?
SUSAN: good. then get it right.

PETER: "baby in a bottle..." he gives it to susan. 
SUSAN: don't tease.
PETER: you know where they get this fertility stuff? they extract it from the urine of menopausal italian nuns.
SUSAN: monks bottle their own wine. don't they?
SUSAN: trust me. i've never been this late. never.
SUSAN: if nun's pee is what it takes...
SUSAN: you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
PETER: don't get here...
PETER: okay, meet me out front. i gotta go. josh's picking me up in five.
SUSAN: i'll be late.
SUSAN: siri, sandblast that thing. it looks like trump tower. those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
SIRI: just like trump tower, then.

JOSH: ...so i say "buddy, you have every violation in the book. gimme one good reason not to close you down." you know what the kraut says to me? 
JOSH: the blintzes! "try the blintzes..."
PETER: selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
JOSH: not just any carbohydrates, mind you. it was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex. we should get a strobe on this thing.
PETER: yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "epidemic! epidemic! you're all going to die!"

JOSH: health department... 
PETER: you really love flashing that thing, don't you?
JOSH: hey. i'm a short guy. waddaya want?
PETER: peter tyler, doh. you gentlemen were the first on the scene?
WOYCHEK: we were both on patrol, saw this paint mess. then i looked through that cellar window. we both did...
PETER: you gone in?
WOYCHEK: no. we waited.
PETER: good.
PETER: get the emt's in there, now.

PETER:  
WOYCHEK: they look real sick, don't they?

SUSAN: ...as long as they're ready for the opening i don't care, just tell them that. 
SIRI: i'm on it. don't worry. look, susan...i don't mean to pry, but... i kinda overheard you and peter.
SUSAN: watch your step, siri. your grant could be on the line here.
SIRI: i just...well, i had this cousin in delhi. she was having problems, too.
SUSAN: what?
SIRI: she used a baster.
SIRI: not a big one. i mean, it was like a turkey baster.
SUSAN: oh,
SUSAN: come on, darlin'...
SUSAN: what's this?
SIRI: oh, right... they been here since noon. i told them you're real busy.
SUSAN: hello.
RICKY: you the bug lady, right?
SUSAN: i suppose so.
RICKY: we're here to deal.

SUSAN: metaxonycha godmani, trigonopelastes delta. field butterflies. have you been upstate? 
DAVIS: avenue b.
SUSAN: i guess they got lost in this city.
RICKY: so, you wanna buy em?
DAVIS: there's extra wings in the bag.
SUSAN: you guys have done a nice job. how bout five dollars?
RICKY: that's it?
DAVIS: show her the weirdbug.
RICKY: cost a dollar just to look.
DAVIS: it's a great bug. we kinda broke it a little...
SUSAN: fellas, i'll tell you what...ten dollars for everything. plus a killing jar, some tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you catch will be in better shape.
DAVIS: deal!
RICKY: you crazy! that's the best!!
DAVIS: bug's almost dead anyway.
DAVIS: thanks, lady.
SIRI: ten dollars?
SUSAN: alphabet city kids- there's much worse things they could be selling.
SIRI: i hate this window...

PETER: internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it. no definite signs of tb, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure. 
JOSH: immigration's gonna love you for that.
PETER: tell them to send flowers to the usual address.

JOSH: two shifts, people rotating from bed to work. one toilet. we're in wal-mart hell, here. 
PETER: did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
JOSH: triad, chinese mafia. they bring people from yunan. slave labor... reverend harry wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. no sign of him.
PETER: tell her she's going to be alright. we'll take care of her.
YANG: she's delirious. keeps saying the "dark angels" are coming for her. she says they took some of her people away.
PETER: dark angels?

SUSAN: siri? siri?! 
SIRI: ...the
SUSAN: can you...?
SUSAN: could you...help me...?

SUSAN: i'm gonna pull it out and i want you to pin it down, okay? 
SIRI: what is it?
SUSAN: i have no idea. are you ready?
SIRI: oh my
SIRI: get it! get it!
SUSAN: it bit you.
SIRI: no

SUSAN: this wing configuration. i've never... 
SIRI: it broke the skin...
SUSAN: and they're not fully developed. this thing's not even an adult.
SUSAN: my
SIRI: what?

SUSAN: it's breathing. 
SIRI: shakes her head.
SIRI: that's impossible. insects don't...
SUSAN: i know. help me get a sample. susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg. the nymph clicks nervously.
SUSAN: hold on, big guy, hold on...

SUSAN: hold on a second... 
SIRI: what?

THE OVERCOAT MAN.: he lowers himself with silent grace. 
SIRI: susan?
SUSAN: call security.

MANNY: not too little, not too much. you rub it in, around and around like this. let the leather take it. 
MANNY: you watching? you should learn to work the shoes. you're good with your hands...
MANNY: chuy...you gonna get all wet.
MANNY: did you look at the story book i got you?
MANNY: our animal friends. can you say that, chico? "friends"?

MANNY: a friend is the one you can trust. when you are with a friend, no matter where in the world, you are at home. 
MANNY: in this city. a friend is a hard thing to find...
CHUY: his face shows a bit of animation.
CHUY: funny shoes...
CHUY: alli. mr. funny shoes.

MANNY: no one is there. is empty. 
MANNY: chuy, listen to me. they have on the cross, but that is not a holy place. you understand?
MANNY: ah, nino. only knows what goes on in your head, eh?
CHUY: mr. funny shoes...

PETER: josh, what was immigration's countdown? 
JOSH: thirty-three workers.
PETER: there are thirty five listed in the reverend wong's roster...
JOSH: 
PETER: remember what that woman said, about people being taken? check with the copsin the area.

PETER: sus? 
PETER: susan?

SUSAN: this thing was the size of my fist, peter!! that's off the charts! 
PETER: okay. so you lost a great specimen-
SUSAN: don't you get it? it's more than that.
SUSAN: you know why insects don't grow larger? because they don't have a complex respiratory system. what i saw did. it had lungs.
SUSAN: evolution doesn't work that fast. something pushed that thing to take the leap. we need to find another specimen.
PETER: we?
SUSAN: i did a ph test on its tarsal pads.
SUSAN: there's only two species who match the enzymes i found. one's a leaf-cutter ant in the amazon...
SUSAN: the other we released here two years ago.

ARMENIAN DRIVER: avenue b... again! maybe you got wrong letter, uh? 
SUSAN: keep going. we'll tell you when to stop...
PETER: maybe they lied to you.
SUSAN: even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
ARMENIAN: no... oh, get away, you turk!
SUSAN: pull over!
ARMENIAN DRIVER: what...?

SUSAN: metaxonycha godmani. 
PETER: so?

RICKY: if you want your money back, forget it! 
DAVIS: we already spent it!
SUSAN: we're here to deal.

PETER: here, let me... 
SUSAN: you sure you didn't see one of these?
RICKY: gross. what is it?
SUSAN: an "ootheca". an eggcase. it probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
RICKY: no way. i see one of those, i'd puke.

DAVIS: it was in that corner over there. 
RICKY: sucker was fast, man. had to take it out with one a these.
PETER: okay, guys. we'll take it from here.
RICKY: make it ten an' we won't tell the cops you're here.
PETER: let's keep it at five and i won't condemn your clubhouse.

SUSAN: let me try. my hands are smaller. 
SUSAN'S: face squinches with the effort.
PETER: honey, just leave it.
SUSAN: no, there's...

A CLICKING SOUND.: susan's hand is almost there. 
SUSAN: reaches further.
LEONARD: now don't tell me.
LEONARD: you lost a token, right?

PETER: look, i showed you my badge... 
LEONARD: yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. that's the old maintenance grid, doc. swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
PETER: the department of public health...
LEONARD: ...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
PETER: fine. you want me to call your supervisor?
LEONARD: please do. he's a lonely guy.

ERNEST: your shoes. 
SUSAN: that's wonderful! what grade are you in?
ERNEST: no school. shoes're all chuy knows about. ernest discreetly points to his forehead.
MANNY: he's special.
LEONARD: he can imitate anything, you just watch him.
PETER: excuse me, i'm talking to you.
LEONARD: no, you talkin' at me.
ERNEST: is there some reward for this?
SUSAN: i guess that could be arranged.
PETER: for chrissakes. you gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
LEONARD: you wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude. leonard saunters away with ernest in tow.

PETER: you give someone a uniform and... did you hear how he talked to us? 
SUSAN: i heard how you talked to him.
PETER: oh, so i'm the bad guy now?
SUSAN: he was just doing his job.
PETER: fine, then i'm the bad guy.
PETER: he wants a permit, i'll get him a permit.

ERNEST: chrissakes... 
ERNEST: guys, c'mon.
ERNEST: i told you to stick by the maintenance area.
BAG LADY: nah... it's private property now.
SKELETAL BUM: he eats down there.
ERNEST: who?
HOMELESS MAN: the stickman.
BAG LADY: long john.
ERNEST: graffiti artist, uh?

CU ERNEST: squinting to see over his flashlight beam. 
ERNEST: hey, buddy!
ERNEST: get off my track...

PETER: heya. where's the boss? siri gestures to the far end of the room. susan stands alone, sipping a chardonnay by an ant mound exhibit. 
SIRI: ant mound.
PETER: you okay?
SIRI: it's just a headache. we were sandblasting trump tower here since four this morning.
PETER: maybe you should sit...
SIRI: i'm fine. go talk to susan. she could use a good word right now. she nods for him to go ahead. peter leaves.

PETER: great crowd. 
SUSAN: no such thing, baby.
SUSAN: i get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
PETER: 'em. they don't know what they're missing.
SUSAN: right.
PETER: what's wrong?
SUSAN: oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. least that's what i thought.
PETER: oh, no, you were-
SUSAN: i was just late.
SUSAN: ironic, don't you think? these guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? and here we are...
PETER: susan, we're not b-
SIRI: susan?
SUSAN: siri... siri collapses. the exhibit tips over. peter pulls susan out of the way just as the exhibit

PETER: ...i think it's some kind of systemic infection, chris. i saw a few cases like it yesterday. a sweatshop in canal. 
RAYMOND: okay, look. you better come in with me. help me through.

RAYMOND: all hands on deck, pete. remember the dril? 
PETER: it'll come back to me.
PETER: looks like a lyme disease rash.
RAYMOND: it's not consistent with the internal bleeding. any idea what bit her?
RAYMOND: i think we're gonna need to have that specimen here.

CHUY: stares without emotion at the plaster figure. movement to his side. he turns again. a dimly-lit figure stands before him. 
CHUY: mr. funny shoes.

SUSAN: ...you don't even know what you're looking for. 
PETER: you said that thing was big as your hand. i don't think i'm going to miss...
SUSAN: why take the chance? just let me go down there with you...
PETER: no.
PETER: susan, listen to me: you handled that insect almost as much as siri...
SUSAN: it didn't bite me.
PETER: i know. but if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
PETER: chris is going to run some blood tests on you. i want you to stay here till he's absolutely sure you're clean. okay? then you'll call me... you'll catch up with us...
PETER: we'll be all right, sus. i promise.

MANNY: my father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get a pitcher. cold water, whoosh, i tell you that's some alarm clock, brrrrr! 
MANNY: ah! there you go! the way you like 'em, chu-chu... we're low on milk, you remind grampa to pick some up tonight, okay?

VOICE: what's the problem? 
WORKMAN: i think it's a baby!

RAYMOND: how you feeling? 
SUSAN: you tell me.
RAYMOND: your blood tests were all negative. you checked out.
SUSAN: what about siri?
RAYMOND: she's stable. i don't think there's any immediate danger, but we'll have to keep her under observation...
SUSAN: you think it's some form of strickler's, don't you?
RAYMOND: pathology's still working on the tissue samples. if it is...it must be an errant strain. shorter incubation period. i'm sorry, sue. we just don't know yet.

JEREMY: ...how many times i gotta tell you, man: we can't accept this! 
EMT: well, what the else am i suppose to do with it?

JEREMY: take it out back and throw it in the friggin' dumpster! 
EMT: not unless somebody signs for it.
SUSAN: oh, my
JEREMY: hey, you can't...
SUSAN: what's your name?
JEREMY: jeremy...
SUSAN: okay, jeremy...go get dr. chris raymond, will you?
JEREMY: lady...
SUSAN: did you hear me? get dr. raymond!

JEREMY: okay. jeremy backs away, takes off down the hall. 
SUSAN: where'd you find it?
EMT: washed up at the filtration plant on bank street. some there thought it was a baby. they called us.
EMT: it's a lobster, right?

LEONARD: better hurry it up, doc. my shift's almost over. 
PETER: guess someone requested you for overtime...buddy.

SUSAN: posterior sternites are gone...half the protonum rotted off. 
RAYMOND: maggots...
SUSAN: near hatching. thing must've died about three weeks ago. susan closes the mandibles and examines them.
SUSAN: do you have a polaroid?

LEONARD: you all watch your step. we got some burrows goin' down seven stories here. you fall, i don't wanna have to come pick you up. 
JOSH: new york's finest.
JOSH: there's really people living down here?
LEONARD: mole people. this section was pretty popular, all the way to fulton street...
LEONARD: substance abusers, mental cases... then about a year ago, poof! all gone. rumors got started... someone found a couple of stiffs...
LEONARD: down here's the land of talk, see? so the wildest version goes the farthest. they mark that area with a sign or a drawing, and its as good as closed. we had one fella... for years said he was bela lugosi. got him on geraldo.

SUSAN: it's me. can you hear me? 
PETER: yeah, barely. we haven't found anything down here. nothing...
SUSAN: i have.
SUSAN: i'm on my way. i've got something for you to look at...

PETER: we'll be back at the platform in... 
LEONARD: 20 minutes. if you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
PETER: 20 minutes. susan?
LEONARD: funny. shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
JOSH: what?
LEONARD: track bunnies. rats. they're usually around.

MANNY: no, no, please understand... i can't wait that long. 
MANNY: please. i write it down. 2... 8... 7... 3. what does this mean "case number"? okay. so, now what? when can you...?
MANNY: no, i can't wait...no, listen...
MANNY: hijos de puta.

JOSH: smells like acid. 
PETER: ammonia.

JOSH: peter... 
PETER: yeah...?
JOSH: there's some weird here.
PETER: weird shit...?
JOSH: take a look.
JOSH: matter, unknown origin: weird whatever it is, it's not human.
LEONARD: and it needs some metamucil.

REPAIRMAN: hey, lady, all power will be down in five minutes, okay? 
SUSAN: okay....
THE POLAROID: the closed jaws. they look like a human face.

SUSAN: peter? 
OVERCOAT MAN: the man's face tips back...
ITS MASK-LIKE FRONT JAWS.: its multi-parted mouth clicks open. susan screams!

THE REMAINS OF AN OLD STATION: fifteen feet below. 
LEONARD: i've never been this deep. this area here is the old armory station. they built it in the 40's. ran out of money half-way through...
LEONARD: okay, the fat lady's singing. time to go. everything is gray with dust.

PETER: don't!! 
LEONARD: did you see the size of that thing?!
PETER: look what you did! you stupid sonofa-

JOSH: rushes forward. 
JOSH: peter!

PETER: it's okay. i'm all right. 
LEONARD: get the away from me!
PETER: he's all right, too.
LEONARD: oh, that's gonna work.
PETER: you got a better way up?
LEONARD: show that to the station manager. tell him leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
JOSH: h-how do i get...?
LEONARD: way we came. take the first tunnel to your right...
LEONARD: go left. go left again till you hit the fork... then right again. you got that?
JOSH: i think so. one right, two lefts...
LEONARD: and a right.
JOSH: right.
PETER: go josh. now.

PETER: any luck? 
LEONARD: well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks. ain't gonna be much use, though. lines are dead.
PETER: you said those cables're still live.
LEONARD: oh, man, there you go again.
PETER: what?
LEONARD: those things bring juice to the new stations. you just can't rewire that
PETER: for chrissakes, what's the problem?
LEONARD: all right, that's it.
PETER: shh! shh!
LEONARD: manny?!
LEONARD: my what the are you...?
MANNY: hurry, the woman needs help!
PETER: woman?

SUSAN: don't. 
PETER: listen to me: we're getting you out.
PETER: give me your belts.
LEONARD: what are you doing down here?
MANNY: chuy. he was taken. he's down here somewhere... oh, please, hurry. i saw what was after her.
PETER: what's...?
MANNY: just hurry.
PETER: i'm coming, sus, i'm coming.

SUSAN: no, no. 
PETER: toss the flare down!
LEONARD: i only got...
PETER: just do it!

PETER'S: eyes grow huge. 
PETER: oh, jesus...
LEONARD: just plain loses it.
LEONARD: what the is that?! what the is that?!
SUSAN: knows all too well what's coming for her.
SUSAN: peter...
PETER: wrap it around your hand!
PETER: come on!
PETER: get on my shoulders!

LEONARD: get the goddam door! 
PETER: push it! push it! don't let up!

LEONARD: what the was that? 
LEONARD: you better tell me what the hell's going on here!
MANNY: hey, hey!! take it easy!!
PETER: wait a minute-
LEONARD: you, wait a minute. i'm going to-

PETER: its muscles are locked. 
LEONARD: oh, jesus!!
MANNY: wait...
LEONARD: oh, it's hitting the bone man, get it off!!
PETER: hey hey hey...
MANNY: is how we make loose the ticks back home.

PETER: just keep holding it. can you do that for me? susan? 
MANNY: doctor tyler?
PETER: you feel anything?
LEONARD: yeah, i feel like ripping your eyes out...
PETER: leonard, listen. i need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. look, i'm trying to help you here...
LEONARD: oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. you and your goddam memo. you needed to prove your point, uh?
PETER: i'm sorry. but i don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
MANNY: where the hell'd that thing come from?
PETER: a mistake.
LEONARD: "mistake"? what's that supposed to...?
PETER: it doesn't matter, all right? it's dead.
LEONARD: how you know that? it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a pipe through its heart...
SUSAN: it doesn't have a heart.
SUSAN: just inner chambers...
MANNY: but it look like a man. it... i saw it.
SUSAN: no...
SUSAN: that's what it wanted you to see.

PETER: so, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or... 
SUSAN: that's camouflage...
SUSAN: this is mimicry. they evolve to mimic their predators. a butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl. a catterpillar can copy a snake...
SUSAN: this has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator it's ever had...
SUSAN: us.

SUSAN: mantids can mimic. we gave the judas that code... 
MANNY: "...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
SUSAN: this, is our baby peter. yours and mine. aren't you proud?

SUSAN: all these...they're like tunnels of an insect colony. once these things hit a certain population density, they'll have to move out, form new colonies. 
SUSAN: we have to get help down here. burn the tunnels before...
LEONARD: get the doors!
PETER: is there a switch?
LEONARD: third rail is dead. get me up. there must be a manual override in the booth.
SUSAN: the lights! peter turns off the flashlights.

LEONARD: where's the crank?! 
OUTSIDE: the mimic is only yards away.

PETER: they're coming! 
OUTSIDE: the shadows get nearer, their clicking louder...

SUSAN: i got it! 
SUSAN: hurry! please!
THROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR: the doors begin to swing shut very slowly.
OUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV: sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.

LEONARD: come on, you son-of-a... 
SUBWAY CAR: a soft click as the doors shut in unison. silence.

SUSAN: his blood! it's driving them crazy! we have to mask the odor! 
PETER: how?!
PETER: it's no use! they know we're in here!
SUSAN: they don't know anything peter, they just sense. they're hardwired!
PETER: right. hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
SUSAN: exac...
SUSAN: give me your razor.
PETER: what are you doing?
LEONARD: 
SUSAN: rub it on the windows!
PETER: what-
SUSAN: just do it!!
MANNY: looks to the roof, listening.

LEONARD: what are you putting that on me for? 
SUSAN: scent glands. insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.

LEONARD: okay. that's us. 
LEONARD: this track we're on? goes down into the repair area. the elevator's over here. leads up to the active tunnels.
PETER: can we get this car there?
LEONARD: someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
SUSAN: but the power...
LEONARD: hell, i might be able to juice the whole area, if i can get to the power box. it's just a couple of cables...
MANNY: oh, how you gonna get there, leonard?
PETER: just talk me through it. i can go with manny.
LEONARD: it would take a minute or so. you won't last that long out there.
SUSAN: peter, you couldn't even fix our tv!
PETER: we'll cover ourselves with this. they can mimic us- we goddam mimic them!
SUSAN: peter-
PETER: it worked before...
SUSAN: the scent won't last...
PETER: that's why we should do it now.

LEONARD: it's just a regular old pump switch, okay? right by the track signal board. 
LEONARD: the lights come up, you pull the switch.
MANNY: i pull.
LEONARD: you don't do that, we're on the wrong track. you...
LEONARD: you gonna finally get to around with the wires. think you can handle it?
PETER: depends. you got a memo?
LEONARD: all right then. you gonna find two wires. one's green. the other's blue...

MANNY: he's out there. i heard him. how can he be? this things... 
SUSAN: manny...
MANNY: i didn't protect him, lady. he trusted me. and i didn't protect him... his father...i lost his father to the streets and now, chuy...
SUSAN: we'll find him. we'll be back and find him.

SUSAN: you're going to have to keep it really slow. their eyes react to sudden movements. 
SUSAN: don't touch it. and for godsakes, try not to sweat. they can sense chemical changes...
PETER: try not to sweat?
LEONARD: okay, people... leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.
LEONARD: ...are we ready for this?
LEONARD: whatever you do, don't step on the third rail coming back. six hundred volts'll blow your leg right off.
