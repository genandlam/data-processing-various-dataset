BENDER: young man...have you finished your paper? bender turns back away and goes to the door. he looks around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.
CLAIRE: what are you gonna do?
ANDREW: drop dead, i hope!

BRIAN: bender, that's, that's school property there...you know, it doesn't belong to us. it's something not to be toyed with.

VERNON: damnit! they laugh.
VERNON: andrew clark...get up here. come on, front and center, let's go.

VERNON: okay, now, watch the magazines!
BENDER: it's out of my hands...
BENDER: that's very clever sir, but what if there's a fire? i think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir.
VERNON: alright, what are you doing with this? get this outta here for sake! what's the matter with you?
BRIAN: you know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library.
BENDER: show some respect!
VERNON: let's go...go! get back into your seat.

BENDER: what can i say? i'm thrilled!
VERNON: oh, i'm sure that's exactly what you want these people to believe. you know something, bender? you ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people. you might be better off. alright, that's it! i'm going to be right outside those doors. the next time i hafta come in here...i'm cracking skulls!

ANDREW: big party at stubbies, parents are in europe. should be pretty wild...
CLAIRE: yeah?
ANDREW: yeah, can you go?
CLAIRE: i doubt it...
ANDREW: how come?
CLAIRE: well 'cause if i do what my mother tells me not to do, it's because because my father says it's okay. there's like this whole big monster deal, it's endless and it's a total drag. it's like any minute...
BENDER: who do you like better?
CLAIRE: what?
BENDER: you like your old man better than your mom?
CLAIRE: they're both strict.
BENDER: no, i mean, if you had to choose between them.
CLAIRE: i dunno, i'd probably go live with my brother. i mean, i don't think either one of them gives a about me...it's like they use me just to get back at each other.
ALLISON: ha!!!
CLAIRE: shut up!
ANDREW: you're just feeling sorry for yourself...

BENDER: can you hear this? want me to turn it up?
BRIAN: hey fellas, i mean...
BRIAN: ...i don't like my parents either, i don't...i don't get along with them...their idea of parental compassion is just, you know, wacko!
BENDER: dork...
BRIAN: yeah?
BENDER: you are a parent's wet dream, okay?
BRIAN: well that's a problem!
BENDER: look, i can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kinda clothes. but face it, you're a neo-maxi-zoom-dweebie! what would you be doing if you weren't out making yourself a better citizen?
ANDREW: why do you have to insult everybody?
BENDER: i'm being honest, asshole! i would expect you...to know the difference!
ANDREW: yeah well, he's gotta name!
BENDER: yeah?
ANDREW: yeah, what's your name?
BRIAN: brian...

CLAIRE: i'm not fat!
BENDER: well not at present but i could see you really pushing maximum density! you see, i'm not sure if you know this...but there are two kinds of fat people. there's fat people that were born to be fat, and then there's fat people that were once thin but they became fat...so when you look at them you can sorta see that thin person inside! you see, you're gonna get married, you're gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then, uh... he mimes becoming fat, making noises.
BENDER: oh...obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl!
CLAIRE: i'm not that pristine!
BENDER: are you a virgin? i'll bet you a million dollars that you are! let's end the suspense! is it gonna be... ...a white weddin?
CLAIRE: why don't you just shut up?
BENDER: have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth? have you ever been felt up? over the bra, under the blouse, shoes off...hoping to your parents don't walk in?
CLAIRE: do you want me to puke?
BENDER: over the panties, no bra, blouse unbuttoned, calvin's in a ball on the front seat past eleven on a school night?
ANDREW: leave her alone!
ANDREW: i said leave her alone!

ANDREW: just me, just you and me. two hits. me hitting you, you hitting the floor! anytime you're ready, pal!
BENDER: i don't wanna get into to this with you man...
ANDREW: why not?
BENDER: 'cause i'd kill you...it's real simple. i'd kill you and your parents would sue me and it would be a big mess and i don't care enough about you to bother.
ANDREW: chicken
ANDREW: let's end this right now. you don't talk to her...you don't look at her and you don't even think about her!

CARL: oh, really? you guys think i'm just some untouchable peasant? peon? huh? maybe so, but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the past eight years i've learned a couple of things...i look through your letters, i look through your lockers...i listen to your conversations, you don't know that but i do...i am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends. by the way, that clock's twenty minutes fast!
ANDREW:

VERNON: well, i don't care what you think, andrew!
BENDER: uh, dick? excuse me, rich...will milk be made available to us?
ANDREW: we're extremely thirsty sir...
CLAIRE: i have a very low tolerance for dehydration.
ANDREW: i've seen her dehydrate sir, it's pretty gross.

ALLISON: why are you here?
ANDREW: um, i'm here today...because uh, because my coach and my father don't want me to blow my ride. see i get treated differently because uh, coach thinks i'm a winner. so does my old man. i'm not a winner because i wanna be one... i'm a winner because i got strength and speed. kinda like a race horse. that's about how involved i am in what's happening to me.
ALLISON: yeah? that's very interesting. now why don't you tell me why you're really in here.
ANDREW: forget it!

BENDER: claire...you wanna see a picture of a guy with elephantitus of the nuts? 
CLAIRE: no thank you...
BENDER: how do you think he rides a bike?
BENDER: oh, claire...would you ever consider dating a guy like this?
CLAIRE: can't you just leave me alone?
BENDER: i mean if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car...although you'd probably have to ride in the back seat 'cause his nuts would ride shotgun.
CLAIRE: you know what i wish i was doing?
BENDER: op, watch what you say, brian here is a cherry.
BRIAN: a cherry?
CLAIRE: i wish i was on a plane to france.

BRIAN: you know he's lying, right?
BENDER: were you or were you not motioning to claire?
BRIAN: yeah, but it was only...was only because i didn't want her to know that i was a virgin, okay?
BRIAN: excuse me for being a virgin, i'm sorry...
CLAIRE: why didn't you want me to know you were a virgin?
BRIAN: because it's personal business, it's my personal, private business.

CARL: when i was a kid, i wanted to be john lennon...
VERNON: carl don't be a goof! i'm trying to make a serious point here...i've been teaching, for twenty two years, and each year...these kids get more and more arrogant.
CARL: aw bull man. come on vern, the kids haven't changed, you have! you took a teaching position, 'cause you thought it'd be fun, right? thought you could have summer vacations off...and then you found out it was actually work...and that really bummed you out.
VERNON: these kids turned on me...they think i'm a big joke...
CARL: come on...listen vern, if you were sixteen, what would you think of you, huh?
VERNON: hey...carl, you think i give one rat's what these kids think of me?
CARL: yes i do...
VERNON: you think about this...when you get old, these kids; when i get old, they're gonna be runnin' the country.

CARL: i wouldn't count on it!

30. INT. LIBRARY - DAY: they are sitting on the floor in a circle. 
ANDREW: what would i do for a million bucks? well, i guess i'd do as little as i had to...
CLAIRE: that's boring...
ANDREW: well, how'm i s'posed to answer?
CLAIRE: the idea is to like search your mind for the absolute limit. like, uh, would you drive to school naked?
ANDREW: um, uh...would i have to get out of the car?
CLAIRE: of course...
ANDREW: in the spring, or winter?
CLAIRE: it doesn't matter...spring...
ANDREW: in front of the school or in back of the school?
CLAIRE: either one...
ANDREW: yes...
ALLISON: i'd do that!
ALLISON: i'll do anything sexual, i don't need a million dollars to do it either...
CLAIRE: you're lying...
ALLISON: i already have...i've done just about everything there is except a few things that are illegal...i'm a nymphomaniac!
CLAIRE: lie...
BRIAN: are your parents aware of this?
ALLISON: the only person i told was my shrink...
ANDREW: and what'd he do when you told him?
ALLISON: he nailed me...
CLAIRE: very nice...
ALLISON: i don't think that from a legal standpoint what he did can be construed as since i paid him.
CLAIRE: he's an adult!
ALLISON: yeah...he's married too!
CLAIRE: do you have any idea how completely gross that is?
ALLISON: well, the first few times...
CLAIRE: first few times? you mean he did it more than once?
ALLISON: sure...
CLAIRE: are you crazy?
BRIAN: obviously she's crazy if she's her shrink...
ALLISON: have you ever done it?
CLAIRE: i don't even have a psychiatrist...
ALLISON: have you ever done it with a normal person?
CLAIRE: now, didn't we already cover this?
BENDER: you never answered the question...
CLAIRE: look, i'm not gonna discuss my private life with total strangers.
ALLISON: it's kind of a double-edged sword, isn't it?
CLAIRE: a what?
ALLISON: well, if you say you haven't... you're a prude. if you say you have...you're a slut! it's a trap. you want to but you can't but when you do you wish you didn't, right?
CLAIRE: wrong...
ALLISON: or, are you a tease?
ANDREW: she's a tease...
CLAIRE: oh why don't you just forget it...
ANDREW: you're a tease and you know it, all girls are teases!
BENDER: she's only a tease if what she does gets you hot...
CLAIRE: i don't do anything!
ALLISON: that's why you're a tease...
CLAIRE: okay, lemme ask you a few questions.
ALLISON: i've already told you everything!
CLAIRE: no! doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love. i mean don't you want any respect?
ALLISON: i don't screw to get respect...that's the difference between you and me...
CLAIRE: not the only difference, i hope.
BENDER: face it, you're a tease.
CLAIRE: i'm not a tease!
BENDER: sure you are! you said it yourself is a weapon, you use it to get respect!
CLAIRE: no, i never said that, she twisted my words around.
BENDER: oh then what do you use it for?
CLAIRE: i don't use it period!
BENDER: oh, are you medically frigid or is it psychological?
CLAIRE: i didn't mean it that way! you guys are putting words into my mouth!
BENDER: well if you'd just answer the question...
BRIAN: why don't you just answer the question?
ANDREW: be honest...
BENDER: no big deal...
BRIAN: yeah, answer it!
ANDREW: answer the question, claire!
BENDER: talk to us!
ANDREW and BRIAN: come on, answer the question!
BENDER: it's easy, it's only one question!
CLAIRE: no! i never did it!
ALLISON: i never did it either, i'm not a nymphomaniac...i'm a compulsive liar...
CLAIRE: you are such a you did that on purpose just to me over!
ALLISON: i would do it though...if you love someone it's okay...
CLAIRE: i can't believe you, you're so weird. you don't say anything all day and then when you open your mouth...you unload all these tremendous lies all over me!
ANDREW: you're just off because she got you to admit something you didn't want to admit to...
CLAIRE: okay, fine, but that doesn't make it any less bizarre...
ANDREW: what's bizarre? i mean we're all pretty bizarre! some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all.
CLAIRE: how are you bizarre?
ALLISON: he can't think for himself...
ANDREW: she's right...do you guys know what, uh, what i did to get in here? i taped larry lester's buns together.
BRIAN: that was you?
ANDREW: yeah, you know him?
BRIAN: yeah, i know him...
ANDREW: well then you know how hairy he is, right? well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too...
CLAIRE: oh my
ANDREW: and the bizarre thing is, is that i did it for my old man...i tortured this poor kid, because i wanted him to think that i was cool. he's always going off about, you know, when he was in school...all the wild things he used to do. and i got the feeling that he was disappointed that i never cut loose on anyone, right...so, i'm...i'm sitting in the locker room, and i'm taping up my knee. and larry's a couple lockers down from me. yeah...he's kinda... he's kinda skinny, weak. and i started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. and the next thing i knew, i uh, i jumped on top of him and started wailing on him...and my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. and afterwards, when i was sittin' in vernon's office, all i could think about was larry's father. and larry havin' to go home and...and explain what happened to him. and the humiliation...fucking humiliation he mustuv felt. it mustuv been unreal...i mean, i mean, how do you apologize for something like that? there's no way...it's all because of me and my old man. oh i hate him! he's like this...he's like this mindless machine that i can't even relate to anymore..."andrew, you've got to be number one! i won't tolerate any losers in this family...your intensity is for win. win! win!!!" you son of a you know, sometimes, i wish my knee would give...and i wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore. and he could forget all about me...
BENDER: i think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling.
BRIAN: it's like me, you know, with my grades...like, when i, when i step outside myself kinda, and when i, when i look in at myself you know? and i see me and i don't like what i see, i really don't.
CLAIRE: what's wrong with you? why don't you like yourself?
BRIAN: 'cause i'm stupid...'cause i'm failing shop. see we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um...and we had eight weeks to do it and we're s'posed ta, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk the light was s'posed to go on...my light didn't go on, i got a on it. never got a in my life... when i signed up, you know, for the course i mean. i thought i was playing it real smart, you know. 'cause i thought, i'll take shop, it'll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average...
BENDER: why'd you think it'd be easy?
BRIAN: have you seen some of the dopes that take shop?
BENDER: i take shop...you must be a
BRIAN: i'm a because i can't make a lamp?
BENDER: no, you're a genius because you can't make a lamp...
BRIAN: what do you know about trigonometry?
BENDER: i could care less about trigonometry...
BRIAN: bender, did you know without trigonometry there'd be no engineering?
BENDER: without lamps, there'd be no light!
CLAIRE: okay so neither one of you is any better than the other one...
ALLISON: i can write with my toes! i can also eat, brush my teeth...
CLAIRE: with your feet?
ALLISON: ...play heart and soul on the piano.
BRIAN: i can make spaghetti!
CLAIRE: what can you do?
ANDREW: i can...uh...tape all your buns together...
BENDER: i wanna see what claire can do!
CLAIRE: i can't do anything.
BENDER: now, everybody can do something...
CLAIRE: there's one thing i can do, no forget it, it's way too embarrassing.
BENDER: you ever seen wild kingdom? i mean that guy's been doing that show for thirty years.
CLAIRE: okay, but you have to swear to you won't laugh...i can't believe i'm actually doing this...
ANDREW: all right, great! where'd you learn to do that?
CLAIRE: camp, seventh grade...
BENDER: that was great, claire...my image of you is totally blown...
ALLISON: you're a don't do that to her you swore to you wouldn't laugh!
BENDER: am i laughing?
ANDREW: you prick!
BENDER: what do you care what i think, anyway? i don't even count, right? i could disappear forever and it wouldn't make any difference...i may as well not even exist at this school, remember? and you...don't like me anyway!
CLAIRE: you know, i have just as many feelings as you do and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them!
BENDER: you're so pathetic! don't you ever...ever! compare yourself to me! okay? you got everything, and i got rapunzel, right? school would probably shut down if you didn't show up! "queenie isn't here!" i like those earrings claire.
CLAIRE: shut up...
BENDER: are those real diamonds, claire?
CLAIRE: shut up!
BENDER: or did your daddy buy those?
CLAIRE: shut up!
BENDER: i bet he bought those for you! i bet those are a christmas gift! right? you know what i got for christmas this year? it was a banner year at the old bender family! i got a carton of cigarettes. the old man grabbed me and said "hey! smoke up johnny!" okay, so go home'n cry to your daddy, don't cry here, okay?
ANDREW: my are we gonna be like our parents?
CLAIRE: not me...ever...
ALLISON: it's unavoidable, it just happens.
CLAIRE: what happens?
ALLISON: when you grow up, your heart dies.
BENDER: who cares?
ALLISON: i care...
BRIAN: um, i was just thinking, i mean. i know it's kind of a weird time, but i was just wondering, um, what is gonna happen to us on monday? when we're all together again? i mean i consider you guys my friends, i'm not wrong, am i?
ANDREW: no...
BRIAN: so, so on monday...what happens?
CLAIRE: are we still friends, you mean?
BRIAN: yeah...
CLAIRE: do you want the truth?
BRIAN: yeah, i want the truth...
CLAIRE: i don't think so...
ALLISON: well, do you mean all of us or just john?
CLAIRE: with all of you...
ANDREW: that's a real nice attitude, claire!
CLAIRE: oh, be honest, andy...if brian came walking up to you in the hall on monday, what would you do? i mean picture this, you're there with all the sports. i know exactly what you'd do, you'd say hi to him and when he left you'd cut him all up so your friends wouldn't think you really liked him!
ANDREW: no way!
ALLISON: 'kay, what if i came up to you?
CLAIRE: same exact thing!
BENDER: you are a
CLAIRE: why? 'cause i'm telling the truth, that makes me a
BENDER: no! 'cause you know how that is to do to someone! and you don't got the to stand up to your friends and tell 'em that you're gonna like who you wanna like!
CLAIRE: okay, what about you, you hypocrite! why don't you take allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties? or take brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high? what about andy for that matter, what about me? what would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together. they'd laugh their off and you'd probably tell them you were doing it with me so they'd forgive you for being seen with me.
BENDER: don't you ever talk about my friends! you don't know any of my friends, you don't look at any of my friends and you certainly wouldn't condescend to speak to any of my friends so you just stick to the things you know, shopping, nail polish, your father's bmw and your poor--rich--drunk mother in the carribean!
CLAIRE: shut up!
BENDER: and as far as being concerned about what's gonna happen when you and i walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it! 'cause it's never gonna happen! just bury your head in the sand...and wait for your prom!
CLAIRE: i hate you!
BENDER: yeah? good!
BRIAN: then i assume allison and i are better people than you guys, huh? us weirdos... do you, would you do that to me?
ALLISON: i don't have any friends...
BRIAN: well if you did?
ALLISON: no...i don't think the kind of friends i'd have would mind...
BRIAN: i just wanna tell, each of you, that i wouldn't do that...i wouldn't and i will not! 'cause i think that's real shitty...
CLAIRE: your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us...
BRIAN: you're so conceited, claire. you're so conceited. you're so, like, full of yourself, why are you like that?
CLAIRE: i'm not saying that to be conceited! i hate it! i hate having to go along with everything my friends say!
BRIAN: well then why do you do it?
CLAIRE: i don't know, i don't...you don't understand..you don't. you're not friends with the same kind of people that andy and i are friends with! you know, you just don't understand the pressure that they can put on you!
BRIAN: i don't understand what? you think i don't understand pressure, claire? well you! you!
BRIAN: know why i'm here today? do you? i'm here because mr. ryan found a gun in the locker...
ANDREW: why'd you have a gun in your locker?
BRIAN: i tried. you pull the trunk on it and the light's s'posed to go on...and it didn't go on, i mean,

ANDREW: what's the gun for brian? 
BRIAN: just forget it...
ANDREW: you brought it up, man!
BRIAN: i can't have an f, i can't have it and i know my parents can't have it! even if i aced the rest of the semester, i'm still only a b. and everything's ruined for me!
CLAIRE: oh brian...
BRIAN: so i considered my options, you know?
CLAIRE: no! killing yourself is not an option!
BRIAN: well i didn't do it, did i? no, i don't think so!
ALLISON: it was a hand gun?
BRIAN: no, it was a flare gun, went off in my locker.
ANDREW: really?
BRIAN: it's not funny...
BRIAN: yes it is...fuckin' elephant was destroyed!
ALLISON: you wanna know what i did to get in here? nothing...i didn't have anything better to do.
ALLISON: you're laughing at me...
ANDREW: no!
ALLISON: yeah you are!

CLAIRE: brian? 
BRIAN: yeah?
CLAIRE: are you gonna write your paper?
BRIAN: yeah, why?
CLAIRE: well, it's kinda a waste for all of us to write our paper, don't you think?
BRIAN: oh, but that's what vernon wants us to do...
CLAIRE: true, but i think we'd all kinda say the same thing.
BRIAN: you just don't want to write your paper...right?
CLAIRE: true, but, you're the smartest, right?
BRIAN: oh, well...
CLAIRE: we trust you...
ANDREW: yeah...
BRIAN: all right, i'll do it...
CLAIRE: great...
CLAIRE: come on...
ALLISON: where're we going?
CLAIRE: come on! we see claire putting eye make-up on allison.
CLAIRE: don't be afraid.
ALLISON: don't stick that in my eye!
CLAIRE: i'm not sticking it, just close... just go like that...
CLAIRE: good...
CLAIRE: you know you really do look a lot better without all that black on your eyes...
ALLISON: hey...i like that black
CLAIRE: this looks a lot better...look up.
ALLISON: please, why're you being so nice to me?
CLAIRE: 'cause you're letting me. we see brian begin to write.

35. INT. LIBRARY - DAY: brian is busily preparing the essay. 
BRIAN: cool!
ALLISON: thank you!

36. INT. CLOSET - DAY: claire kisses bender, then she breaks the kiss. 
BENDER: why'd you do that?
CLAIRE: 'cause i knew you wouldn't.
BENDER: you know how you said before, how your parents used you to get back at each other...wouldn't i be outstanding in that capacity?
CLAIRE: were you really disgusted about what i did with my lipstick?
BENDER: truth?
CLAIRE: truth...
BENDER: no...

ANDREW: what happened to you? 
ALLISON: why? claire did it! what's wrong?
ANDREW: nothing's wrong, it's just so different. i can see your face.
ALLISON: is that good or bad?
ANDREW: it's good! allison smiles.
