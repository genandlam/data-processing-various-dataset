WADE: is that what you're going to sing? 
SUELEEN: no -- that's exercises. my coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. that's the place where i sing.
WADE: you think i got any kind of a voice?
SUELEEN: you sure do it loud.
WADE: is that good?
SUELEEN: it's not bad.
WADE: you think i should take lessons?

BARNETT: what do you really want?
TRIPLETTE: not a thing, barnett, really. i need a little information. but, ah, it can wait.
BARNETT: you bet.
TRIPLETTE: okay. thanks.
DOCTOR: well, it's exhaustion, pure and simple, and you're going to have to take a rest or you're going to be in big trouble.
BARNETT: she has to be at the opera tomorrow night and then she can go home.
DOCTOR: she's not going anywhere, barnett. this is precisely what i'm talking about. she is collapsing. she cannot go on without a rest or she will have to stop altogether for a long time.
BARBARA JEAN: well, i have to go: it's too late to be replaced, and, besides, i just can't do that. those people get disappointed. they've come in from all over, you know, and this miss foxy who's been writing to me for years is going to be there from michigan.
DOCTOR: you cannot leave this bed until i say so. the two of you have to understand that. barnett, you've got to stop this dovetailing and give her some rest. you don't need to make that much more money.
BARNETT: it's not the money. the friends and neighbors love her and they want to see her. we got a debt to the public.
DOCTOR: well, they are not going to see her tomorrow night, and i suggest you get on the phone and make the necessary arrangements.

OPAL: she never came. i'm trying to gather some information about the characteristics of music people for english television. i started in san francisco. some friends were making an anti-war film about 'nam, you know, and i just love marine movies. it is really the consummate art form, all those parts of the puzzle to make the whole. all that energy being collective, you know what i mean?
OPAL: i've been all over the united states now except for maine and vermont.
OPAL: what did you say your name was?
STAR: star.
OPAL: star - oh! that's a fantastic name. almost as good as opal. i changed my name in taos. this man that was really into low budget movies said my eyes were opalistic.
OPAL: i'm going to make the consummate documentary as soon as i finish gathering information. you know it's so nice not to feel oppressed in a society that is male oriented.
STAR: are you in music?
OPAL: no, i told you that.

SUELEEN: you like it? listen, where is the pianist? i need to go over this with him.
SUELEEN: you all didn't say what you wanted to hear.
SUELEEN: someday i'm gonna be a star like barbara jean.

TRIPLETTE: sueleen, you're prettier and probably sing better. besides, she is unusually sick. and tonight you have the opportunity to work in front of some grateful gentlemen. 
TRIPLETTE: have you ever done this before?
TRIPLETTE: well, it's not too hard. you'll sing whatever it is you want to sing. they'll applaud like crazy 'cause i can tell them that you're really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or not sing. it really doesn't make much difference, really. but since you've never done this before, singing might help.
TRIPLETTE: now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. the more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
SUELEEN: i see.
TRIPLETTE: i know that you are an artist and i am sure you are very religious.
TRIPLETTE: well, this is for people who have a kind of religious belief in the way they live.

TRIPLETTE: everybody likes to be as good as their word.
BARNETT: whose word?
