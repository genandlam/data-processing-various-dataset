MAYOR: where have you been?

MAYOR: when? 
JACK: immediately!
MAYOR: [in his mayor truck]

JACK: there are objects so peculiar they were not to be believed all around, things to tantalize my brain it's a world unlike anything i've ever seen and as hard as i try i can't seem to describe like a most improbable dream but you must believe when i tell you this it's as real as my skull and it does exist here, let me show you this is a thing called a present the whole thing starts with a box 
DEVIL: a box?
WEREWOLF: are there locks?
HARLEOUIN DEMON: is it filled with a pox?
DEVIL, WEREWOLF, HARLEQUIN DEMON: a pox how delightful, a pox
JACK: if you please just a box with bright-colored paper and the whole thing's topped with a bow
WITCHES: a bow? but why? how ugly what's in it?
JACK: that's the point of the thing, not to know
CLOWN: it's a bat will it bend?
CREATURE UNDER THE STAIRS: it's a rat will it break?
UNDERSEA GAL: perhaps it s the head that i found in the lake
JACK: listen now, you don't understand that's not the point of christmas land now, pay attention we pick up an oversized sock and hang it like this on the wall
MR. HYDE: oh, yes! does it still have a foot?
MEDIUM MR. HYDE: let me see, let me look
SMALL MR. HYDE: is it rotted and covered with gook?
JACK: um, let me explain there's no foot inside, but there's candy or sometimes it's filled with small toys
MUMMY AND WINGED DEMON: small toys
WINGED DEMON: do they bite?
MUMMY: do they snap?
WINGED DEMON: or explode in a sack?
CORPSE KID: or perhaps they just spring out and scare girls and boys
MAYOR: what a splendid idea this christmas sounds fun i fully endorse it let's try it at once
JACK: everyone, please now, not so fast

DR. FINKELSTEIN: oh my head...the door is open. 
JACK: hel-lo
DR. FINKELSTEIN: jack skellington, up here my boy.
JACK: dr. i need to borrow some equipment.
DR. FINKELSTEIN: is that so, whatever for?
JACK: i'm conducting a series of experiments.

CITIZENS OF HALLOWEEN: something's up with jack something's up with jack 
JACK: christmas time is buzzing in my skull will it let me be? i cannot tell there's so many things i cannot grasp when i think i've got it, and then at last through my bony fingers it does slip like a snowflake in a fiery grip something here i'm not quite getting though i try, i keep forgetting like a memory long since past here in an instant, gone in a flash what does it mean? what does it mean? in these little bric-a-brac a secret's waiting to be cracked these dolls and toys confuse me so confound it all, i love it though simple objects, nothing more but something's hidden through a door though i do not have the key something's there i cannot see what does it mean? what does it mean? what does it mean? hmm... i've read these christmas books so many times i know the stories and i know the rhymes i know the christmas carols all by heart my skull's so full, it's tearing me apart as often as i've read them, something's wrong so hard to put my bony finger on or perhaps it's really not as deep as i've been led to think am i trying much too hard? of course! i've been too close to see the answer's right in front of me right in front of me it's simple really, very clear like music drifting in the air invisible, but everywhere just because i cannot see it doesn't mean i can't believe it
JACK: you know, i think this christmas thing it's not as tricky as it seems and why should they have all the fun? it should belong to anyone not anyone, in fact, but me why, i could make a christmas tree and there's no reason i can find i couldn't handle christmas time i bet i could improve it too and that's exactly what i'll do hee,hee,hee
JACK: eureka!! this year, christmas will be ours!

VAMPIRE: what kind of a noise is that for a baby to make? 
JACK: perhaps it can be improved?
VAMPIRES: no problem!

LOCK: i say that we take a cannon aim it at his door and then knock three times and when he answers sandy claws will be no more

LOCK,SHOCK, AND BARREL: kidnap the sandy claws tie him in a bag throw him in the ocean then, see if he is sad

BARREL: he'll be so pleased by our success that he'll reward us too, i'll bet 
LOCK, SHOCK, AND BARREL: perhaps he'll make his special brew of snake and spider stew ummm! we're his little henchmen and we take our job with pride we do our best to please him and stay on his good side
SHOCK: i wish my cohorts weren't so
BARREL: i'm not the one
