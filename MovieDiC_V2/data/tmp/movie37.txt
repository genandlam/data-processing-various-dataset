SHARON: can you hear me? this one's conscious! 
VOICE: paramedics on the way!

SHARON: wait. wait. listen to me. can you feel that? 
SHARON: that's my hand. hold it. go on -- as hard as you can.
SHARON: it's over, and i've got you, and you're safe. you're safe now. you got that? don't let go. don't let me go.

SHARON: that car is older than they are. 
ROBBY: '67 chevy impala.
SHARON: that's what i said.

ROBBY: needs a servicing. 
SHARON: don't we all.
SHARON: get it together, officer.
ROBBY: pogo! almost spilled my coffee again! you didn't like his hair, or what?
SHARON: i love elvis hair. they were going two miles an hour.
ROBBY: let's roll to this -- fight in progress.

CATCH: y'know... since we're both walking the same way, i could take one of those bags for you. that way, i do some upper body work while i'm walking along. helps my back. what d'you say? 
CATCH: right now your mind's making pictures of me robbing your groceires, but, y'know, nine times out of ten, people do the right thing.
OLD MAN: it's the dog food that makes it so heavy.
CATCH: i guess it's worth it... for a good dog.

KID: look at this whoo! benny, look at this! 
KID: you come in with me. hey,
KID: you're going to arrest me, you come into the back seat with me. come on!
KID: come on. we'll have a good time.

SHARON: three adam five -- show us 1019 to the jail with one male prisoner. 
KID: take off your uniform. take off my handcuffs, and come back here. i want one touch.
ROBBY: give it a rest!

KID: that ain't the touch. that ain't the touch i want. 
ROBBY: as i remove your cuffs, i want you to put your hands here. spread your legs. more.
ROBBY: that's it. back off, john, we got it.
SANDERMAN: you trying to be a bad-ass, pogue?
SHARON: i just dealt with the situation.

SANDERMAN: and you don't see a pattern here? i want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it. all right? are you taking notes? 
ROBBY: you broke his nose.
SHARON: he grabbed me. end of story.
ROBBY: and you were waiting for him. you were hoping. you were making long-range plans for his while he was mouthing off in the car -- and you're supposed to be above that
SHARON: if you think i crossed the line, put it in the report.
ROBBY: pogo, stop the what is it? you off at me, too?
SHARON: not you, rob. you're a rare unthreatened male cop with a good marriage, and you like to eat where i eat -- so everything's code four.
ROBBY: come over for dinner tonight. i'll call charlene. she'd like to see you. it's been awhile. we'll talk about it.

SHARON: thanks. but she'll invite friends, try and fix me up. she's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me. 
ROBBY: she doesn't worry about that.
SHARON: they all worry about that.
SHARON: you don't need to fix me, robby, or fix me up. i don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing -- or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who i am inside my head.
ROBBY: got some action, huh? well, that's promising.
SHARON: yeah. hot and heavy.

CATCH: hey! you want to turn that volume down? what's your point? 
DRIVER: what did you say?
CATCH: what's the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code? don't you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments -- old people, sick people?
DRIVER: you better watch your mouth,
CATCH: why? what're you gonna do? kill me?
MAN #2: guy's nuts. let's go.

CANDACE: hi. 
CATCH: hi. your keys are in the...
CANDACE: oh, thank you. thanks a lot. i was trying to carry tommy and all these bags. he was so tired. of course, as soon as i put him down he had all this energy...
CANDACE: y'know, we were just baking nectarine bars because the peaches weren't ripe. ever had a nectarine bar?
CATCH: sorry. gotta be going.

MRS. VANDER: sherry! 
SHARON: hi, mrs. vander. you're looking good.
MRS. VANDER: oh, you just wait. i splurged.
MRS. VANDER: it's for the church and the party.
SHARON: looks great.
MRS. VANDER: y'know, i cried over the invitation -- just imagine me in church. it'll be so good to spend time with you.

MRS.   VANDER: you know dan and i renewed our vows last year. i bet that's where your mom got the idea. 
SHARON: their vows?
MRS. VANDER: your mom and dad -- the ceremony...
MRS. VANDER: oh, well... y'know, i just got that invitation a few... just now, so i'm sure you'll...
SHARON: oh, yeah. we've had... there's been some problems with the mail in our building, so... i'll probably get it today.
SHARON: so, i guess i'll see you.
MRS. VANDER: sure, honey. i'll see you there.

SHARON: i didn't see his truck, so... 
LARRY: he's not here.
SHARON: how you doing?
LARRY: i'm okay.
SHARON: kathy and the boy? bet he's big now.
LARRY: growin' fast.
SHARON: is he looking more like you now -- or did he get lucky?
LARRY: he's got kathy's looks and brains and my strong back. you should feel his grip. you just passing by?
SHARON: place is coming along nice. the octagon window. dad's signature.
SHARON: look, larry, i shouldn't have to hear it from mrs. vander -- about what's happening. he turns back to his work now as they speak, uncomfortable.

LARRY: what's happening? 
SHARON: so you really weren't going to tell me? nobody was going to tell me? mom and dad renewing their vows, the church, the party. mrs. vander is all excited. she bought a new dress. it's blue.
LARRY: we're workin' on dad. we think you should be there. we told him.
SHARON: mom told him?
LARRY: we mentioned it.
SHARON: he's holding out, hah?
LARRY: you want to come?
SHARON: it's my family. lar. it's over ten years, and he won't let go of it.
LARRY: you two were always head to head.
SHARON: for good reason. remember?
LARRY: let's just leave it.
SHARON: you're still scared of him.

LARRY: i don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. people see it, they think we're in trouble here. 
SHARON: nice seeing you, too.
SHARON: two more minutes.

KATHY: hi! look -- it's your auntie sharon. 
SHARON: hey, champ, my look how big.
LARRY JR.: hi.
SHARON: ow! you hurt my hand with that grip. whew.

KATHY: we're bringing larry his lunch. hey, it's good to see you. it's been awhile. what? 
KATHY: oh, i went boom into a low shelf -- chasing after him of course. how're you doing?
SHARON: i'm semi-okay. i heard about the... ceremony and the party.
KATHY: oh. i hope you'll be there. really.
SHARON: take it easy. you too, champ.
SHARON: oh, no. you're not breaking my fingers again.

ROBBY: freeze! 
SHARON: three-a-5, foot pursuit. suspect fleeing south on pico place, young man, green jacket. no visible weapon... robby!
ROBBY: right behind you! stop and lie down with your arms...
ROBBY: careful!
SHARON: i see him!

ROBBY: gun! 
SHARON: freeze! right there!
ROBBY: hey! wait!
RAY: you got him?
ROBBY: he was armed.
RAY: 
ROBBY: citizen took him down.
RAY: no shit!?

RAY: what happened here? 
CATCH: i... just saw it and... i saw the gun, so...

ROBBY: you all right, pogo? 
SHARON: i was dead. y'know.
SHARON: he had me. i was dead.

CATCH: i was just walking by. i live near here. 
SANCHEZ: sergeant's going to want to talk to you, mr. lambert. we'll need a statement.
RAY: don't worry about it. that's just procedure. look -- we appreciate what you did. no let us buy you a drink tonight, all right? you know where the rib house is?

CATCH: i got you nectarines because the peaches are hard as rocks. 
ELANORA: your jacket's all dirty.
CATCH: i tackled a guy.
ELANORA: why would you 'tackle' a guy?!
CATCH: why do you think?

CATCH: he had the ball. he was going for a touchdown. 
ELANORA: can you be serious?

CATCH: what day is today? 
ELANORA: wednesday.
CATCH: no.
CATCH: met somebody today.
ELANORA: oh? that's good. ahh -- they had the broccolini today. thank you.
CATCH: a woman.
ELANORA: you didn't tackle her, too, did you?
CATCH: no.
ELANORA: good, catch.
CATCH: she's a police officer.
ELANORA: are you in trouble?
CATCH: no. no trouble.

ELANORA: well... that's a good thing. 
CATCH: i saw her once a long time ago.
ELANORA: where?
CATCH: she looks the same.

COP: beautiful. 
SANCHEZ: yeah. my wife's got him in agility class.
RAY: no

RAY: 'rex.' rex is good. i wonder who the first person was to name a dog 'fido,' and what the does it mean? 
SHARON: i like how you're always asking the big questions, ray.
RAY: i got a big question for you, pogo -- but i can only ask it when we're alone.
SHARON: here -- use this -- call your wife and ask her instead.
SANCHEZ: i happen to know ray's wife is busy tonight.
RAY: why doesn't your partner ever come out with us?
SHARON: robby's a family man.
RAY: i'm a family man.
SHARON: yeah, but his family actually likes him.
RAY: that lambert -- i guess he's not showing either.

RAY: where are you going? 
SHARON: the head. do you mind?
SANCHEZ: she's just gonna freshen up her makeup.
RAY: you're wearing makeup?
SHARON: that reminds me, ray. you still have that eye-liner you borrowed from me?

FLASHBACK - MAN: pointing the gun at her face today. 
BACK TO SHARON: in the mirror and see how shaken she still is.

SHARON: we thought you wouldn't show. why you sitting here? 
CATCH: i don't talk to a lot of people. would you...?
SHARON: i didn't have a chance to thank you. i'm sharon pogue.
SHARON: you look familiar.
CATCH: i guess i live on the beat you patrol.
SHARON: why would you do that -- jump a man with a gun?
CATCH: he was going to shoot you.
SHARON: he could've shot you. you have a death wish? you a bungee jumper?
CATCH: no. i didn't have time to think about it.

SHARON: what d'you think about it now? 
CATCH: i figure... it was worth the risk.
SHARON: for someone you don't even know?
CATCH: yeah -- and for what you do. i think cops are great. out there, trying to keep it safe. you know? tough job. firemen are everybody's heroes. kids wave at firemen. people should wave at cops. did you ever think about how many people are walking around this town because you saved them?
SHARON: i never thought about it.
CATCH: ... because you helped them or because you arrested somebody who would've hurt them or because you just... did your job?
SHARON: now i'm walking around this town because of you. ever think about that? maybe you should be a cop.
CATCH: i don't know... i look pretty in a hat...
CATCH: ... and i don't drive and, like i said, i don't talk to many people. am i talking too much? i am. you go ahead.
SHARON: okay. what d'you do? you employed around here? oh, sorry. every time i try to talk to somebody, it comes out like an interrogation.

CATCH: where do you want to be ten years from now? 
SHARON: what?
CATCH: somebody taught that to me. kind of a shortcut. you ask somebody, what are your plans for tomorrow -- what're your dreams for ten years from now. it's supposed to get things started.
SHARON: does it work?
CATCH: i never tried it.
SHARON: 
CATCH: no. really. i just remembered it -- is my witness.
SHARON: not in here. it's mostly cops.
SHARON: you have a nice smile.
SHARON: so... what were we talking about? oh, yeah, you were giving me some line about starting a conversation.

CATCH: the shortcut. 
SHARON: okay. i'll play.
SHARON: tomorrow i've got a night watch shift. if the weather clears, in the morning i'll go hiking. if it rains, i'll go to the gym -- and the laundromat. ten years from now... i want to be living in some mountainous place.
CATCH: tibet?
SHARON: could be tibet. could be colorado. your turn.
RAY: hey, pogo -- don't keep him all to yourself. come on over, lambert, join the group. we'll buy you dinner, give you a medal for saving pogo's ass.
SHARON: actually, i'm kind of tired, ray.
CATCH: oh. i'll... walk you to your car.
CATCH: thanks for the drink.
RAY: least we could do. we don't like her very much -- but we don't want to lose her.

SHARON: it's not a great neighborhood. maybe i should walk you to your car. 
CATCH: i don't have a car.
SHARON: want a ride home?
CATCH: oh, thanks, but... i like to walk.
SHARON: it's starting to rain. don't be a hero.
CATCH: yeah. if it's no trouble. thanks.
SHARON: okay... ten years from now, what d'you want to be doing?
CATCH: i don't know. this is pretty good.

CATCH: can you drive okay? 
SHARON: i'm not drunk. you think i'm drunk? i'm not. you'll know i'm drunk when i'm throwing up, and i never throw up, so don't worry about it.
CATCH: the only time i worry is when people tell me not to worry.
SHARON: get in the car, will you?
CATCH: i'm on lundy street, just off pico.
SHARON: i'm good at this.
CATCH: streets are wet.
SHARON: are you one of those people who drive ten miles an hour in the rain? i hate that.
CATCH: i never drive.
CATCH: i'll be alright.

CATCH: y'know, i can picture you in colorado. 
SHARON: oh yeah? what am i doing there?
CATCH: driving around... off.
SHARON: i'm not off at you.
CATCH: give me some time.
SHARON: those guys in the bar are my friends -- sort of. we work together, we tell jokes and we bullshit, but i can't say to them...
CATCH: what?
SHARON: every time i close my eyes, i see that gun pointing at me and i don't know why i'm telling you unless it's because you were there and because i had three drinks, but i'm not ready to go inside and close my eyes and i don't want to go to your place and i don't want to keep driving around, so what the do we do?

CATCH: whew. i feel like we're boxing, and you've got me on the ropes. we'll do whatever you want. 
SHARON: what i want is to know how you happened to be walking by that parking lot at that minute. what if you hadn' t been there?
CATCH: i guess we were supposed to meet.
SHARON: if you want -- you can come in for a minute.
SHARON: want a drink?
CATCH: no thanks.
SHARON: sit down or something.
CATCH: i'm circling awhile.
SHARON: you're not supposed to look around. i didn't have time to straighten up.

CATCH: so... it's more real this way. 
SHARON: it's rude.
CATCH: now that i'm in here, you seem mad about it.
SHARON: i'm not mad. you'll know when i'm mad. i don't usually let somebody in here, but here you are. that's all. let's talk about something stupid.
CATCH: you first.
SHARON: okay -- one thing i don't believe is that 'supposed to' business. we were 'supposed to' meet. that sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access tv. you believe that?
CATCH: some people say we each give off a particular odor -- that can only be detected by one other person's brain.
SHARON: so, we... smell each other? who says that?
CATCH: i have no idea. i'm more in the destiny school, we-met-in-another-life school. do you believe that? do you think when we die -- we come back in another form?

SHARON: you mean like a duck? no. i think dead is dead. i've been thinking about it all day -- and i don't want to think about it anymore. 
SHARON: why'd you do that?
CATCH: see? now you're thinking about me.
CATCH: let me guess. colorado.
SHARON: it's austria, but i can't picture myself in austria. i'm not good with languages, so i couldn't qualify for the departments over there.
SHARON: thanks for... coming up here.
CATCH: does that mean i'm going?
SHARON: no. you don't have to. i...
CATCH: you okay now?

SHARON: oh. you're here as a medic. 
CATCH: is this the mad part?
SHARON: maybe going is a good idea.
CATCH: can i come back some time?
SHARON: why?
CATCH: i better go.
SHARON: oh,

DRIVER: what the do you think you're doing?! 
DRIVER: are you crazy?!

MAN: that's my car! what the were you doing? 
CATCH: nothing. i just...
MAN: i saw you! what did you take out of there?!
CATCH: no, i rolled up the window. it's rain...
MAN: you take my phone?! hah?!
CATCH: hey! hey! wake up! wake up!
CATCH: i helped you. i helped you.
CATCH: i'm sorry.

CATCH: oh. sorry.

MOTHER: are you well?
SHARON: i guess i'm well. is this always here?
MOTHER: yes. it's always there.
SHARON: did larry tell you i came by where he's working? is that why you called me?

SHARON: who's 'we.' you said 'we' want to invite you.
MOTHER: the family.

SHARON: how come you're renewing your vows? 
MOTHER: it's sort of... a fresh start.
SHARON: your idea?
MOTHER: no. both of us. it's a way of...
SHARON: wasn't it blessed before?
MOTHER: sherry... of course it was blessed. you just...
SHARON: i just what, mom?
MOTHER: you just think about the bad, and you never remember the good. i wish you remembered the good.
SHARON: sorry. i wish i did, too. does he? remember any good about me?
MOTHER: of course. he doesn't hate you.
SHARON: hurt? i hurt him?
MOTHER: being arrested like that.
SHARON: oh? how come you forgot what he did?

MOTHER: it wasn't as bad -- you always make it sound worse. and it hasn't been that way for years. 
SHARON: i'm glad it hasn't been that way. that means it worked, mom. that was the point. that's why i did it. christ. why do i get punished for it?
MOTHER: honey, nobody's punishing you. we're inviting you. will you come?
SHARON: of course i'll come.
MOTHER: we didn't think you'd want to.
SHARON: why not?
MOTHER: we don't want any trouble... on that day. please.
SHARON: mom, i'm your daughter. i don't want any trouble -- ever. i'll come to the ceremony. i won't come to argue, and i won't come in uniform.
MOTHER: it's on the 23rd. saint monica's.
SHARON: i'd like you to send me an invitation. mrs. vander said it's a beautiful invitation.
MOTHER: i'll show you.

SHARON: mom. i'd like to get one... in the mail... from my family. okay? 
MOTHER: yes.
SHARON: tell dad... thanks.

SHARON: check your messages.
SHARON: i need more sleep. come back in a month.
CATCH: come back? what makes you think i'd come back here?
SHARON: then why are you here?

CATCH: i'm here to tell you that when you tell someone you're going to be somewhere then that someone rearranges his life and you should be more aware of that and a lot more considerate instead of just... 
SHARON: what's in the bag?
CATCH: what? none of your business.
SHARON: did you bring some coffee?
CATCH: you think you deserve coffee?
SHARON: what else did you bring? food?
CATCH: you definitely don't deserve food. i've got coffee, sugar, sweetener, non-dairy...
SHARON: just black. black. thanks.
SHARON: so what kind of life did you rearrange in order to get to denny's? you never said one word about yourself last night. what d'you do?
CATCH: what's the difference?
SHARON: what's the difference?! you're standing in my bedroom. that's the difference. who are you?

CATCH: i'm not.
SHARON: then tell me straight out. who are you?
CATCH: what is it you're looking for?

SHARON: your life. i don't want any surprises. 
CATCH: this is it. i sleep here. i walk around town. that's all of it.
SHARON: that's all of it?
CATCH: yeah. except for you -- the way i feel about you.
SHARON: which is?
CATCH: surprising. i thought it was impossible. i thought i was...
SHARON: you thought you were what? gay?
CATCH: dead. in a way.
SHARON: i'm supposed to understand that?
CATCH: no. did you ever wonder what 'scratch' meant, when people say, 'we'll start from scratch'? this is scratch. we can start from here.

LARRY JR.: i know.
LARRY: why'd you come by?
SHARON: to see kathy.

KATHY: don't make it worse. 
SHARON: it gets worse?
KATHY: he's okay now. he's torn up about it. don't make him mad.
SHARON: when larry and i were growing up, our mother said that all the time. 'don't make your father mad.' has he hit larry jr. yet?
KATHY: he never would.
SHARON: oh. just you, huh?
LARRY: what d'you think you're doing in my house, shar? in my home. she walks out of the room and he follows her.
SHARON: you see a pattern here, bro?

LARRY: i lost my temper. things got out of hand. it won't... 
SHARON: people always say that: 'i've got a temper.' like it's an excuse.
LARRY: i don't need a lecture.
SHARON: you want to hit someone? next time your 'temper' flares up, lar, and you just have to hit somebody, you go home and hit your father.
LARRY: you blame everything on him.
SHARON: i'm blaming you, you coward.
LARRY: you don't come in here...
LARRY: you don't come in here and call me names.
SHARON: what do you call a man who uses his wife as a punching bag? coward.
KATHY: don't hurt her, lar...!

SHARON: it's you, right? 
SHARON: can you just shut up? just shut up and listen.
CATCH: i didn't say anything.
SHARON: i don't want to talk. i don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a... 'angel of mercy' or... whatever. i don't care, but i don't want to hear about it. all right? i don't want to hear anything.
SHARON: it's a bad night.
SHARON: this is good... but i'm too tired to stand up anymore.

CATCH: all my days are the same.
SHARON: yesterday. okay. yesterday we rolled on a 415. juliette and sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they were h.d.b. and definitely unco-op. it got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and robby got a sprained wrist, so i did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a d.b. in sunset park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and i usually do all right but the smell got to me, and i can still smell her. then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and i carried her little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real tight and making my shoulder wet and i wanted to punch her rock-head mother, and then shift ended and i had a nice visit with my brother larry.
CATCH: i'm sorry. that would make anybody sad.
SHARON: sorry you asked?

CATCH: no. no, you can always tell me. 
SHARON: well... i feel better now. you feel better?
CATCH: i feel fine. great.

PINDELLA: oh... is there a problem? 
SHARON: i'm not sure. who am i speaking to?
PINDELLA: i'm dr. pindella.
SHARON: what kind of doctor?
PINDELLA: what is this?
SHARON: do you know a catch lambert?
PINDELLA: oh. yes! is he in trouble?
SHARON: i... need to talk to you.
PINDELLA: well, i have a patient in five minutes. but i can...
SHARON: are you a...?
PINDELLA: i'm a psychiatrist.
SHARON: and mr. lambert...
PINDELLA: my relationship with mr. lambert is confidential.

SHARON: he's your patient. he's your patient we... know all this. this is police business. i'm officer sharon pogue -- l.a.p.d. 
PINDELLA: look... i want to help mr. lambert but i can't tell you anything that isn't public record.
SHARON: in general. in general. he's your patient, and he...
PINDELLA: he's not my patient. he walked away from treatment. that was...
SHARON: why did he walk away?
PINDELLA: i can't discuss that, but if you know how to reach him, i would appreciate being able to talk to him.
SHARON: you can help by just telling me what's in the public record. it'll take me half a day to do a search. can you tell me? just... she is unable to play this out as a "cop," her emotions coming through. pindella sees this. she sits on the edge of a chair and takes a breath, speaks more softly.
SHARON: can you please tell me what's in the record?
PINDELLA: you were with him -- in the car. your uniform threw me. are you his friend?

SHARON: more. 
PINDELLA: i can tell you he was in an accident, hospitalized, referred to me as an outpatient...
SHARON: what accident?
PINDELLA: a bus... a city bus hit his vehicle. that was a couple of years ago. it was... an awful thing. his family was in the van. his wife and child. his wife's parents...
SHARON: a bus... and a van. where? on... the freeway?

PINDELLA: i think so. yes. near santa monica. on the freeway. he was severely injured but... thrown clear. the others were trapped in the van. 
BACK TO SHARON: still in shock, looks at pindella again.
SHARON: survivors? only him? i... don't remember.
PINDELLA: remember?

SHARON: yes. i was there. i was there. 
PINDELLA: his wife's mother survived, but... she was paralyzed.
PINDELLA: elanora chu. she's still in town, i believe.
SHARON: does he... still see her?
PINDELLA: he used to. i don't know. i'm glad to see... he has someone else who cares about him. i know he's running from this. he left all his friends, his home, his whole life.
SHARON: he says... he doesn't remember the accident.
PINDELLA: he lost a lot of memory. i tried to help him with that. he resisted. walked away.
SHARON: i think he remembers me.
SHARON: how does he live?
PINDELLA: he received a large settlement from the city, but he...barely touches it. he was a professional musician.

SHARON: catch, it's me. can you pick up? 
SHARON: why don't we... meet tomorrow? i'll be in westwood. can you meet me there? westwood and cole.

SHARON: that's okay. 
CATCH: it's hard to explain, but it's...
SHARON: you don't have to explain.
CATCH: so... why'd we meet here?
SHARON: so you're the trumpet player who was waking people up -- on my beat.
CATCH: i used to practice late...
SHARON: on your roof? that's why we couldn't find you.

CATCH: i didn't know it bothered anybody until you mentioned it. you arresting me? 
CATCH: you going to tell me where we're going? that's okay. i mean... i'll go anywhere with you, shar. jaws of death. the mall on a saturday. just about any...

SHARON: you can trust me, you know. 
SHARON: i've got you now. i'm holding on -- like before.
CATCH: what d'you mean?
SHARON: like i held you before. like i did -- at the accident.

SHARON: what makes it so... unspeakable, catch? what makes it like that? 
SHARON: is it because you were driving?
SHARON: i read the reports, and it wasn't your fault. it wasn't. is it because you survived and they didn't?
SHARON: catch. please. hold on, and we'll go in there together...
SHARON: you can talk to them. you can say goodbye or i love you or whatever...
CATCH: this is wrong! it's wrong! why are you doing this?!
SHARON: to help you.
CATCH: i don't need your help! i don't need this. we don't need this -- we're fine...
SHARON: we're not. we're not fine, catch. nothing is fine -- no matter how much you pretend.

SHARON: you pretend that nothing happened. you walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside. 
CATCH: i'm not dying! i'm not pretending! i don't remember! i don't remember any of it. so leave me alone! what good does it do? it's gone! and i'm all right this way! why do you have to change it? i'm all right. she points at the building across the street.
SHARON: then walk in there.
SHARON: walk in there, and i'll walk in with you. walk in there and say it's real -- what happened is real. your family died.
CATCH: don't talk about that! don't!
SHARON: all right -- you talk about it! you tell me your family died and i say yes, i know, i'm sorry, and you say, i loved them... and i say, what an awful thing to lose a family...
CATCH: you, shar. you -- why won't you stop?!
SHARON: so you can have a life!
CATCH: i have a life! we could have a life. we could get up and go to work and come home to each other and never, never talk about before. we don't need to do that!

SHARON: because it happened! because it's the truth! i'm sorry. i'm so sorry it happened, but... 
CATCH: nothing happened! if we say it, then that's the truth, that can be the truth. say it. nothing happened. say it, shar.
SHARON: catch -- take my hand. please.
CATCH: say it! i'm asking you to say it.
SHARON: i can't.
CATCH: why not?
SHARON: because i want it too much. i want everything with you. i want all of you -- not just the part that isn't hiding and running away...
CATCH: why are you pushing so hard? why does it have to be your way? why does it have to be your truth? this is who i am! this is the way i am!
SHARON: not anymore. it doesn't have to be this way anymore because you're not alone -- because we're the family now. we can be the family...
CATCH: you like to push people, don't you? you just have to push and shove and make it right for you -- for you. you push everybody, shar. you even pushed your family away, didn't you?

SHARON: i just... want to say... 
CATCH: you already said it. you said it all.
SHARON: when you're ready, i'll be there for you. i just want to say that.

RAY: pogo? bring your friend. 
SHARON: no, i think i'll turn vegetarian.
RAY: gotta have that meat to keep your strength up.
SHARON: how come it's not working for you?

ROBBY: pogo...? 
SHARON: which store is it?
ROBBY: the little market there. they came through a back window last night. mostly vandalism...
SHARON: whoa...
SKATER: sorry!
WORRIED MOTHER: oh, thank you. billy!
ROBBY: pogo?

SHARON: there's something i have to do. i need an address and phone. 
ROBBY: what's the name?
SHARON: elanora chu.
ROBBY: let's do it.

ELANORA: pogo? 
SHARON: i'm sharon pogue. i know all about the...
ELANORA: elanora.
SHARON: i'm sorry for... what happened. i know about the accident.
ELANORA: he told you?!

SHARON: no. i found out, and... i remembered. i was there. 
ELANORA: oh. yes.
SHARON: i guess he comes here a lot -- to talk to you.
ELANORA: he shops for me. twice a week.
SHARON: oh. and when he comes here -- he never mentions the past, never talks about the accident?
ELANORA: no.
SHARON: and you... let him do that? all this time? why?
ELANORA: it's what he needs.
SHARON: walking all over the city like...
ELANORA: like an angel. yes. sweet man.
SHARON: but... you let him get so lost.
ELANORA: i let him find his own way through it. why did you come here, sharon?
SHARON: because... i want to know how to help him.
ELANORA: you are helping him.

SHARON: i don't think so. 
ELANORA: why not?
SHARON: he... he was paying me back, i guess, for the accident, for helping him. that's why he felt... so close to me. but...
ELANORA: is that what you think?
SHARON: but now he probably hates me.

ELANORA: what happened? 
SHARON: i took him to the cemetery, and...
ELANORA: the cemetery!
SHARON: i thought it might help him... come back, you know? but he wouldn't even go in. he screamed at me.
ELANORA: what made you take him there?
SHARON: for the truth...
ELANORA: he knows the truth.
SHARON: but he won't even say it, or...

ELANORA: that's his way. that's his way through all this. he made a wall -- around that whole day, that night -- other things, too. he keeps them behind the wall -- his little boy, my daughter. he can't help it. the cemetery?! do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery? can you imagine? 
ELANORA: that's where it stares you in the face -- the loss. and it's too much sometimes.
ELANORA: see? i'm still finding my way through it. and catch -- it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or...
SHARON: i was trying to help him... come back to some kind of life. i...
ELANORA: but he was coming back. do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks? his apartment, his life, his music is coming back. he fell in love! he even got a job, sharon -- for you. for the two of you. isn't that coming back? why do you have to rush? everybody has to rush these days.
SHARON: i was scared. i push so hard...
ELANORA: scared of what?

SHARON: losing him. so i did. i lost him. he won't talk to me. i... i didn't know what i was doing. 
ELANORA: you were finding your way. what else can we do? you think i'm always sure what to say to him, what not to say? i do what i think is right and hope he sees the love in it.
ELANORA: look at you -- so worried now, so miserable. that's the love in it.
SHARON: did i... make it worse for him?
ELANORA: i don't know. i really don't. but i think he'll see the love in what you did.

KATHY: she came. 
KATHY: don't say anything. think of your parents.

CATCH: annie. chet. i don't... want you to think i forgot about you. it's just that i... i couldn't find you. i woke up, and you were gone. everything was gone. it all just... disappeared. in one minute. i couldn't remember that minute. i lost it. it took me so long to find it. i think i found it all now. i used a calculator. i did. i figured it out. you know... we get about 1400 minutes a day and so i figured it out. i was 33 years old and three months and eight days, so it was... i've got it here... 
CATCH: it was minute number 17 million eight hundred ten thousand, two hundred... or so.
CATCH: that's the one i lost. and... when i lost that minute, i guess i tried to lose it all, all the memories -- because they hurt. i tried, but... i couldn't do it.

CATCH: at the grave, struggling through this. 
CATCH: chet... you weren't feeling so good, remember? it was your birthday, and you ate too much.
CATCH: and, annie, you said... you said...
ANNIE: slow down in the rain, all right?
CATCH: and i don't know if i slowed down. i don't know. i hope i did, but... i didn't always listen. i'm sorry. i'm really sorry.
CATCH: ... you put him on your lap, and he looked at me, and i made a face. remember? i made you smile, chet.

CATCH: sorry, shar. for what i said. 
SHARON: me, too.
CATCH: was it bad?
SHARON: they don't like me in there.
CATCH: then they don't deserve you in there.
SHARON: that's a nice thing to say.
CATCH: it's not a thing to say. it's the truth.
CATCH: why do you try so hard not to cry?
SHARON: it's not fair.
SHARON: it's not fair. things got better for them because of what i did. things got better, and i'd still do it. i'd do it all over again. and it's not fair they shut me out. it's not.

SHARON: it's not fair. i was 19, and i didn't know what else to do. i didn't know how else to stop it. it's not fair i don't have a family anymore.
CATCH: no. it's not, shar. it's not.
CATCH: we're the family, pogo.
