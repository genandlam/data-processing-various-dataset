speaker2: he

speaker1: divorce? an alcoholic relative? tell me, did chip torture animals when he was young?
speaker2: no, he did not! we are a loving supportive family, mr. stubbins.
speaker1: well, you're doing something wrong, mrs. sutphin. i'd recommend therapy for your son. thank you for taking the time to come to pta.

speaker2: man, i just ate. turn it off.
speaker3: rewind it! let's see it again!
speaker2: no! that is sickening!
speaker1: look, dick-head!

speaker1: the "citizen kane" of gore movies. scotty looks at gore on video, jumps up to run to bathroom, yanks open bedroom door and screams when he sees mom standing there with a plate of chocolate chip cookies.

speaker3: excuse me, mrs. sutphin.
speaker1: hi, mom.
speaker4: hi, mrs. sutphin.

speaker3: nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
speaker1: misty, i made your favorite sesame broccoli...

speaker2: it's on all of them!
speaker3: hello.

speaker3: what happened?
speaker4: this is
speaker5: ..police claim the driver of the hit and run vehicle ran down the teacher in cold blood and then backed up over his body to finish off the job. mr. paul stubbins was thirty-eight years old...
speaker1: whoever did it should get the death penalty!
speaker5: ...so far only one eyewitness has surfaced.
speaker6: it was a blue car...i know that much!
speaker3: that's lu-ann hodges!
speaker7: she's a pothead!
speaker6: ...a blue station wagon...
speaker2: that's like your car, beverly,
speaker8: i'm not that bad a driver. look at her
speaker7: you

speaker1: i can't stop thinking about that poor teacher. goodnight, honey. don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow. 
speaker2: i've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the eastern shore.
speaker1: goodnight, honey.

speaker1: oohhhhh! yeah! yeah!

speaker1: there's dede! he's my favorite chickadee! he's here every morning for breakfast. 
speaker2: well, honey, chickadees breed in alaska, you know. no wonder dede's hungry. it's a long trip all the way to baltimore. mom continues tracking the bird in her binoculars until she freezes in horror at the sight of mrs. ackerman running her mouth next door to detectives moore and bradford and pointing to mom's car. suddenly the phone rings with jangling intensity.
speaker2: hello...
speaker3: eugene, it's ralph sterner. got a dental emergency here! i mean this tooth is killing me!
speaker2: well, mr. sterner, if you call my office, i'm sure we can see you monday.

speaker1: mrs. sterner, his wife, grabs the phone. 
speaker2: eugene, this is betty sterner, he'll die by monday! the roots are infected! he might have a heart attack!
speaker3: all right, mrs. sterner... nine o'clock. mom's face changes to purple rage as she turns to hide her anger from dad.
speaker3: i'm sorry, honey. but the birds will still be there next week.
speaker4: it's ok, eugene. i understand.. i'll go fix breakfast.

speaker1: mom! what's the matter? 
speaker2: time to get up, that's all.
speaker1: you scared me.

speaker1: honey, what's the matter? 
speaker2: i'm stoodup! i'll kill that bastard!
speaker1: don't say words unless you mean them, misty. cops bang loudly on door. mom jumps.
speaker2: it's him!
speaker1: no, honey, it's the police. hello, officers. subtitle appears "7:10am" and then fades out.
speaker3: good morning, mrs. sutphin.
speaker2: hi, detective moore.
speaker4: morning, misty. mrs. sutphin, i presume you heard of the death of mr. stubbins.
speaker1: a fine man. a good teacher...
speaker3: contrusions...fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
speaker1: what a mess.
speaker1: no, honey, it's just scotty. scotty, who doesn't wear his seatbelts!
speaker5: good morning, detectives.
speaker6: nightmare on calverton court!
speaker7: the maryland teacher massacre!
speaker4: that's not funny, son.
speaker3: did you drive your car to the pta meeting yesterday, mrs.
speaker1: yes, i did.
speaker5: detectives, what is this about?
speaker4: i know this sounds weird, mr. sutphin, but the department of motor vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of mr. stubbins' pupils.
speaker5: surely you don't think beverly was involved!
speaker7: she did it! aimed the car right at mr. stubbins and mowed him down!
speaker1: from what i understand, the eye-witness is a drug user.
speaker2: i got somebody you could run over, mother!
speaker5: misty, that's a terrible thing to say! detectives, it's time for you to leave. my wife knows nothing about this terrible ...accident.
speaker1: murder, honey.
speaker7: now, here's a babe!
speaker4: let's see that, young man.
speaker2: nice buns!
speaker3: "p" as in...
speaker1: ...people who don't mind their own business. dad looks at mom suddenly, for the first time showing slight suspicion.
speaker1: it's mrs. ackerman's magazine, honey. look at the subscription label if you don't believe me.

speaker1: don't forget me, boys! all rinsed and ready to recycle! 
speaker2: morning, mrs. sutphin.
speaker1: morning, gus. hello, sloppy. here you go. you work hard for the environment. a little drink never hurt anybody.
speaker3: thanks, ma'am. good stuff. do you believe that litterbugger?
speaker1: i've told her! it takes ninety to one hundred years for a tin can to decompose but she still won't recycle.
speaker2: cost taxpayers millions of dollars last year but she don't care about the national budget!
speaker1: i hate mrs. ackerman.
speaker2: i hate her too.
speaker2: yeah, hack her up and recycle her!
speaker1: for the sake of this planet,

speaker1: ...but your boyfriend was convicted of killing twelve people 
speaker2: i don't judge him.
speaker1: how can you love a mass-murderer?
speaker2: easy! he's handsome. he's famous. and we get conjugal

speaker1: serial hags! woman who love men who mutilate! we'll be right back after this! 
speaker2: turn it off.
speaker3: violence is everywhere these days

speaker1: oh, it's just beverly. 
speaker2: she scared me.
speaker1: come in, beverly. have some coffee
speaker3: just a half-a-cup. hello, dottie. i'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
speaker2: it's not fair!!
speaker3: are those pussy-willows?
speaker1: dried ones. aren't they pretty? dottie freezes in horror when she recognizes the p-word in mom's voice.
speaker2: what did you just say?
speaker3: pussy-willows, dottie!
speaker3: dottie! watch what you're doing!
speaker2: i didn't do it!
speaker4: my franklin mint faberge egg!
speaker3: dottie didn't mean to be a clumsy ox. she's sorry, aren't you, dottie?
speaker2: rosemary, i didn't break your egg - she did!
speaker1: you could at least apologize, dottie. i
speaker5: but...but...she...rosemary, i heard her voice! it's

speaker1: mr. sterner, you've lost a tiny filling. i have to drill deeply enough to remove all the decay. 
speaker2: alright...go ahead...but be careful, it really hurts! dad begins to drill again.
speaker2: owwwww'! you! you're hurting me on purpose!

speaker1: are you ok, ralph? 
speaker2: mrs. sterner, please stay in the waiting room!
speaker3: help me, betty! he's worse than the dentist in "the marathon man"!
speaker4: sorry to interrupt, dr. sutphin, but there's two police detectives here to see you...

speaker1: what is it, officers? 
speaker2: dr. sutphing is your wife a big reader?
speaker1: bird books mostly...
speaker3: like these we found in her garbage? "urge to kill". "mass murder in houston"?
speaker1: i'm sure those are my son, chip's books.
speaker2: no, they're your wife's. we checked, she bought them down at "the browse and learn bookshop" along with a few other titles...
speaker3: "helter skelter", "hunting humans", master card reference number 7876.

speaker1: these yellow-jackets! 
speaker2: always something isn't it? can i help you?
speaker3: just looking.
speaker2: thanks for not buying anything!
speaker1: misty, lighten up. it's not the customer's fault carl stood you up!
speaker4: young man, this faberge egg is chipped.
speaker5: yes, ma'am, it is.
speaker4: i'll give you fifty cents.
speaker5: that's a franklin mint piece.
speaker4: eight dollars?! franklin mint or not, it's damaged goods!
speaker4: i'll take this instead.
speaker5: nice one, huh? winter's coming. three dollars?...i guess that's what i marked it... mrs. ackerman smirks and pays him.
speaker1: did you find your franklin mint egg, rosemary darling?
speaker4: i saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
speaker1: you want me to keep that under the table for you?
speaker4: if you wouldn't mind... it was on sale.
speaker6: honey, pleeease? for my little knick-knack shelf?

speaker1: i can't believe it! don knotts! 
speaker2: it's
speaker3: misty, honey, look! i made a killing!

speaker1: i went back to get my faberge egg and some bought it! 
speaker2: it's just not your day, is it rosemary?
speaker3: watch the booth! i'll be back!
speaker1: beverly, honey, you've got some... ...do-do on your shoe.
speaker2: ewwww! thank you, rosemary.

speaker1: there was a lady in the men's room! i swear! a pretty little lady in the stall right next to me! 
speaker2: mrs. ackerman is looking in revulsion at what appears to be dried blood on the end of her
speaker3: that's one-hundred fifty-eight dollars.
speaker4: will you take a new york check?
speaker3: certainly.
speaker5: mother! it's carl! he's dead!
speaker3: 0h, that's horrible, honey. i sold the pee-wee herman doll!!
speaker5: mother! did you hear me?! someone murdered carl in the mensroom! i saw his dead body!
speaker3: you got your wish.
speaker5: but... i didn't

speaker1: chip! our mother is charles manson! 
speaker1: i'm not kidding. carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....

speaker1: yes murdered! you said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. i don't know...maybe mom's nuts! 
speaker2: it's a cool idea, misty! let's make a gore movie about mom! better yet, a tv series!
speaker3: can i borrow your mother? my aunt is coming over to dinner tonight and she's
speaker4: i believe you, misty. your mother could kill - i've seen that look in her eyes! is there a reward or anything?

speaker1: dinner's served! 
speaker2: let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
speaker1: amen to that. it's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!

speaker1: nice as pie she was to me and then i hear her say it! 
speaker2: say what, ma'am?
speaker1: "are those..." i can't say the word out loud.
speaker2: could you tell a police

speaker1: maybe... 
speaker2: it's ok...nobody's gonna hurt you. come on, let it out...
speaker1: "pussy" she says to me!

speaker1: she's gone! 
speaker1: she's gonna kill scotty!

speaker1: turn right on timonioum road. 
speaker2: if mom's a psycho, scotty will still be ok, won't he?
speaker3: we hope so, son. and no matter

speaker1: suspect's family is entering house. send backup to 2l14 sycamore street. i've got a feeling old mom's inside. i'm goin' in! 
speaker2: what was that?
speaker3: i didn't hear anything.
speaker2: dr. sutphin said no sweets for you.
speaker3: what's he know?
speaker2: how to send a bill!!

speaker1: mr. sterner runs across lawn screaming. 
speaker2: help! police!!

speaker1: scotty stares in complete mortification as the 
speaker2: home sweet home! everything's fine, kids!
speaker3: i can't believe i thought my own mother was a murderess!
speaker4: i'm disappointed she isn't! for a while there, it was like being in a movie!

speaker1: dad, i thought it was ok. make them go away. this is embarrassing. 
speaker2: just ignore the police. it's all a terrible mistake.
speaker3: think we'll get on "a

speaker1: she's headed for church. 
speaker2: i say we nail her!
speaker3: negative. d.a. says no bust until lab report is back matching suspect's fingerprints on true-crime book with those on scissors and fire poker.
speaker2: she may be beaver cleaver's mother...but jim jones and the entire people's temple just her!

speaker1: ...the senseless killing last night of towson couple, ralph and betty sterner, brings to a total of four murders police feel may have been committed by baltimore's first serial killer... 
speaker2: beverly! not the sterners!
speaker3: it's a shame. but they should brush their teeth, honey.
speaker1: this just came in. police lieutenant ronald habbler has publicly named a suspect in the serial killer case and it's a shocker!
speaker3: oh, honey!
speaker4: tell me the truth, mom! it's ok with me, really! are you a serial killer?
speaker3: chip, the only cereal i know about is rice krispies.
speaker2: don't worry, beverly. we're going to get you good psychiatric help.

speaker1: so, mrs. sutphin! tell me! 
speaker2: who?

speaker4: "serial mom"?

speaker1: blessed be father, son and holy spirit... 
speaker2: and blessed be his kingdom, now and forever. amen...

speaker1: ...jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross, did he?! mrs. ackerman and mrs. hinkle nod in pious agreement. 
speaker1: ...if ever there was a time to go on record against the death penalty, wasn't it that night?!...
speaker1: capital punishment is already the law in the state of maryland!...

speaker1: now, let us pray and humbly confess our sins unto almighty 
speaker2: ...most merciful we confess that we have sinned against thee... chip and misty ...by what we have done...
speaker3: ...and by what we have left undone...
speaker4: ...we are truly sorry and we humbly repent...
speaker5: ...so that we may delight in thy will...
speaker5: ...and walk in the ways to the glory... ...of thy name...
speaker6: amen!

speaker1: we'll show 'em, mom, we'll go on "60 minutes"! 
speaker2: alright you're bigger than jason or freddie now! only you're a real person!
