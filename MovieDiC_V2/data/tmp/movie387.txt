COOL WOMAN: this, this image of the, the man eating woman. it isn't our increasing demands. i think it's the shrinking american male...
SAD WOMAN: no, i never had, well, whatever it is you call it. but the hours he works, i can't blame him...

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE: ... but it's a problem. a big problem. with so many women i know... 
JOB: just keep your pants on, ladies...

LADY COMMENTATOR: before world war one -- american men outnumbered women by over six percent. today american women not only outnumber men, but live five years longer -- leaving them in control of vast corporate wealth and seventy-five percent of america's purchasing power... 
JOE: y'all,line up and take your turn...
MODERATOR: my question is this -- will american know-how come up with a marketable male to replace all the men who are worrying themselves into an early grave over women's increasing sexual demands?

RATSO: my friend o'daniel. that's who you need. operates the biggest stable in town. in the whole goddam metropolitan area. a stud like you - paying! -- not that i blame you -- a dame starts crying, i cut my heart for her...
JACKIE'S VOICE: i'd call that a very minor operation...
JACKIE: ... in fact, you just sit comfy and i'll cut it out with my fingernail file. you won't even need blue cross, ratso.
RATSO: the name is rizzo.
JACKIE: that's what i said, ratso.
JOE: hey now, you heard him.
TV DATE GIRL: i pick number two! he's cool!

RATSO: look, with these chicks that want to buy it, most of 'em are older, dignified, right? social register types. they can't be trotting down to times square to pick out the merchandise. they need a middleman, right? that's o'daniel. 
RATSO: it is a crime, a stud like you passing out double sawbucks to a chick like that. with proper management you should be taking home fifty, a hundred bucks a day.

JOE: hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this mister o'diddle bird right now? 
RATSO: well, joe, you're a nice guy, and i'd be doing you both a favor, but why? what'm i dragging my leg all over town for? it's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?

JOE: well, i hope you know what you're in for. i'm a very dangerous person. someone does me bad like you. if i caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead ratso long about now. hear?
RATSO: i'm impressed. you're a killer.
JOE: so if you want me to hang around for a few days, i thought you should know.
JOE: property of the ymca. you make me wanna puke sometimes, ratso.
RATSO: joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am i wrong? you know, in my own place my name ain't ratso. i mean it so happens my name is enrico salvatore rizzo.
JOE: shee-it, man, i can't say all that.
RATSO: rico then, at least call me rico in my own goddam place.
JOE: rico! rico! rico! is that enough? and keep your meat hooks off my radio.

GREENGROCER: you! out! out! i told you, i calla cops! 
JOE: hey, looka here, that ain't nice, picking on a cripple...

RATSO: the two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. that's a known fact. if i can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out. 
JOE: this is an okay setup you got here, but i'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
RATSO: i been sick. hold this, will ya?
RATSO: in florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin.
JOE: i think finding you's the smartest thing i ever did, for both of us. you just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder i need to get me hustling in this town. hey!
RATSO: miami beach is the only place for a real hustler. florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. they lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
JOE: what's all this sweet talk about florida? your friend o'daniel got a stable down there now?
RATSO: cowboy killers! break my finger, christ! i got news for you, baby, no chick with any class buys that big cowboy crap...
RATSO: ... the cowboy bit's out, except among of a certain type, which take a certain, type hustler to exploit. like i could handle it -- being a stealing operation basically -- but take your average fag, very few of them want a cripple.
JOE: well, i am that's for sure. i don't talk right. i can't think too good. just only one thing i ever been good for's loving. women go crazy for me. fact. crazy annie. had to send her away. so i don't cash in on that, what am i? i'm shee-it. may's well flush me down that hole with the dishwater.
JOE: that's why you gonna stop crapping about florida and get your skinny moving to earn twenty bucks worth of management you owe me...

RATSO: look at yourself, joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. for a stud in this town that's a handicap. 
JOE: you talk like a man with a tin twat.
RATSO: you ain't got a chance in hell. you need threads and glitter, baby. a front, hey?
JOE: well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.

RATSO: a woman in your condition shouldn't do that. let me help... 
JOE'S VOICE: it ain't right, stealing from a pregnant lady.
RATSO: what did it cost her? the laundromat syndicate lost a couple coins. i'm crying.
RATSO: where's mine? the black homburg? i brought it in the same time.

JOE: hey, you're good! i bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried. 
RATSO: and end up a hunchback like my old man? you think i'm crippled? you shoulda caught him the end of a day.
RATSO'S VOICE: you think it's funny?

RATSO: stupid coughed his lungs out breathing that resin all day. they buried him with gloves on. even the undertaker couldn't get his nails clean. 
JOE: kee-rist, you pretty clever for a skimpy little gimp.
RATSO: you like it? take a look.
JOE: don't rush me. how i do it, see, i get myself primed, like i was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around! -- and there you are, you handsome devil.
RATSO: not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
JOE: what i'm gonna do, i'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. how about that? build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, rat-stuff.
JOE: okay, you got yourself one handsome, sweet-smelling cowboy, strut your stuff...

RATSO: mr. mcneill, i'm calling for miss beecham at the barbizon hotel for women. she won't need you tonight... 
RATSO'S VOICE: would you believe a whole goddam hotel with nothing but lonely chicks?
RATSO: score once in that setup, the way chicks talk,
RATSO: get the money! remember cass trehune? cash! these rich write a check at night, call the bank and stop payment in the morning. get the cash!

JOE: shee-it. cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. you make me puke. where'd you steal it? 
RATSO: the coat? a guy i did a favor once gave it to me. christ.
JOE: who'd you ever do a favor for? you just let some poor freeze to death, wouldn't you?
RATSO: where'd that come from?
JOE: forty-second street. where'n you think it come from?
RATSO: you wanna know the truth? you bastard, i got it for you. look at it. goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
JOE: wear it yourself. i wouldn't put it on my back.
RATSO: if i'll wear it!
JOE: go get your medicine. before you die on my goddam, hands...

JOE'S VOICE: shee-it. i hate boneyards. 
RATSO'S VOICE: so split. he ain't your goddam, father.

JOE: kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, ratso. 
RATSO: the name's rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
JOE: respect shee-it! you even steal flowers for his grave.
RATSO: can he smell the difference, eh?
JOE: well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved aunt winifred'.
RATSO: he can't read. even dumber than you. couldn't write his own name. x -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. one big lousy x like our flat. condemned. by order of city hall.
JOE: my grammaw sally buck, she died without letting me know.

JOE: just ain't right, cheating someone dead and can't cheat back. 
RATSO: you and my old man. same kinda mind. putting me down till the day he died... ... why can't you be like your brothers? sons a father could be proud of. yeah, sure. my brothers. too goddam busy making something of themselves to show up when the old man's dying!
RATSO: what was that all about?
JOE: you wanna read something, read this. i been invited somewhere.

JOE: they picked me. the only one in the whole goddam place. you see how they looked me over, up and down before they give me that? 
RATSO: so?
JOE: well, this thought just struck me. it wasn't too long ago i was washing dishes way the somewhere in texas.
RATSO: yeah, well, so?
JOE: now i'm here. i'm in new york city. getting picked for things. don't you see what i'm driving at?
RATSO: what you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
JOE: did i say that? did i? it don't say nothing about you...
RATSO: don't say nothing about you either.
JOE: but they picked me, right? so what i'll do, i'll just say, now look, you want me? well, i don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
RATSO: well, what the hell, i got nothing better to do.

JOE: better dry your hair some. you sweating all over the goddam place. 
JOE: you got a comb?
RATSO: don't need a comb.
JOE: few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
RATSO: okay? i look okay?

JOE: better get a hold of someone and tell them i'm here. 
JOE: well, i made it. this here is ratso rizzo and i...
RATSO: rico. rico rizzo.

RATSO: if you want the word on that brother and sister act, i'll give you the word. that hansel's a and gretel's got the hots for herself. so who cares, right? load up on the salami...
JOE: shee-it, this is one helluva party!

SHIRLEY: i can tell, can't you? 
JOE: yeah, oh yeah.
SHIRLEY: what'll we do? leave now or what? your place or mine? oh the second i looked at you i knew. did you?
RATSO'S VOICE: she's hooked...

RATSO: ... i'd say she was good for ten bucks, but i'll ask for twenty... 
SHIRLEY'S VOICE: did you know? we were going to make it?
RATSO: you really want to do business?
SHIRLEY: who's he? oh don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
HANSEL'S VOICE: why are you laughing, joe?
HANSEL: are you for real, joe?
JOE: well, i ain't a f'real cowboy, but i'm one of a stud!
RATSO: a very expensive stud. and i happen to be his manager.
SHIRLEY: it's too much -- to come face to face with a walking talking fantasy -- to buy a man's --
SHIRLEY'S VOICE: i can't wait to tell my man monday. i should be taking notes. look at my arm!
RATSO'S VOICE: i gotta sit down. i feel crummy.
SHIRLEY'S VOICE: eat it -- a man in your line of work has to keep his strength up...
SHIRLEY: it's fantastic, now i know, everything you do has sexual implications. if i you know, bought it -- could i take pictures of you naked? that's part of it, isn't it, kinda things?
HANSEL'S VOICE: we want you, joe. you've been chosen.
SHIRLEY'S VOICE: i had a thing for him. before i knew. why should knowing make it more of a thing?
SHIRLEY: naturally i'll have to ask myself why a cowboy? and why a cowboy whore? but not tonight.

SHIRLEY: incidentally, how much is this going to cost me anyway? 
JOE: tell her, ratso.
RATSO: twenty bucks...
SHIRLEY: sold. let's go.
RATSO: ... and taxi fare for me.
SHIRLEY: get lost.
RATSO: i agree. and for that service i charge one dollar taxi fare.

JOE: well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. can you walk or not?
RATSO: walk? naturally i can walk.
SHIRLEY: he's got taxi fare.
JOE: sure you're all right?
RATSO: i said yeah! yeah, yeah, yeah!

SHIRLEY'S VOICE: that happens. don't worry about it... 
JOE: well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
SHIRLEY: top drawer. maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
JOE: first goddam, time it ever quit on me. fact.
JOE: you think i'm lying!
SHIRLEY: no. of course not. just something struck me funny...
SHIRLEY'S VOICE: i just put myself in your shoes. i had this image of a bugler without a horn, a policeman without a stick, etcetera, etcetera and i... i think i'd better shut up, i'm making it worse.
SHIRLEY: maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
JOE: i ain't sleepy.
SHIRLEY: i know. scribbage!
JOE: shee-it...
SHIRLEY: that's pretty freudian, joe.
JOE: what? it's a perfectly good word, ain't it. how much time i got? goddam sand thing drive you crazy. kee-rist. spelling never was a very strong point with me. even in school.
SHIRLEY: if you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
JOE: talking helps. don't talk, you get muddled in your head. hey! now you just look at this here!
SHIRLEY: there's an e in money. if that's your word.
JOE: m-o-n-y -- i'm right! that's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. m-o-n-y.
SHIRLEY: okay. never argue with a man.
JOE: y -- what in starts with y?
SHIRLEY: it can end in y day, pay, lay -- hey, pay lay!
JOE: cut it out. that's cheating, teasing me so i can't think. just one bitsy y word and i gonna beat you!
SHIRLEY: you gonna beat me, joe?
JOE: beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
SHIRLEY: gay ends in y. fey. you like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
JOE: i show you what problem --
JOE'S VOICE: whoopee ti yi yo...

SHIRLEY: why don't you just come here? i'll be working every night this week. 
JOE'S VOICE: well, ma'am -- shirley -- i sure hate to trouble you, but...

JOE: see what you think of that crap. i'll pour your soup. got some of that junk you like to swill, too. mentholatum. aspirin. all that shee it... 
JOE: they wrong?
RATSO: no. but while you was buying the underwear, i could have lifted the socks.
JOE: you couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. can you hold this?
RATSO: but thanks. hey, joe, don't get sore about this or anything. you promise?
JOE: yeah.
RATSO: well, i don't think i can walk. i mean, i been falling down a lot and, uh...
JOE: and what?
RATSO: i'm scared.
JOE: what of?
RATSO: what'll happen. i mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, christ!
JOE: who?
RATSO: i don't know. cops. or the -- how should i know?
JOE: okay. here it is. you gonna go see the doctor. i got nine bucks and twenty more thursday and i gonna be riding high before you know it. so you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
RATSO: no doctors. no, sir. not me. doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. fix one-thing, unplug another. operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. my old man, for sake, wasn't any sicker'n i am when he went to the doctor.
JOE: well, just exactly what the you think you're gonna do? die on me?
RATSO: i'm going to florida, that's my only chance.
JOE: you know what's wrong with you? you got fevers. you as a bedbug.
RATSO: i'll find the money. if you just get me on the bus, that's all i ask.
JOE: just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
RATSO: i don't even want you to go. whaddya think of that? i got other plans for my life than dragging around some cowboy that thinks he's gift to women. one twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in new york city. it's laughable.
JOE: when i put you on that bus down to florida tonight, that'll be the happiest day of my life!

TOWNY'S VOICE: bravo... 
TOWNY: how are you? townsend p. locke, from chicago. call me towny. i'm here to attend a paper manufacturers' convention and, frankly, to have a little fun, dammit...
TOWNY: this is my first night in town and i'll consider it a ghastly omen clouding my entire ten days, if you don't consent to have dinner with me. anywhere you like...
TOWNY: ... never mind how you're dressed. they know me. i'll say you're with the rodeo. there's always a rodeo in new york, dammit. besides, you look very elegant...

TOWNY: but, dammit all, i just remembered, we'll have to eat in my room because i have this phone call coming at nine-thirty... 
TOWNY: what i like about you, you're such a wonderful conversationalist. so won't that be nice to have dinner sent up?
TOWNY: fifty years ago this was the only hotel in manhattan. my mother always calls me at her bedtime, so i've got to be there.

TOWNY: a drink? i've got some nice gin. if you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up... 
JOE: gin's okay.
TOWNY: it's so exciting. new york. the mad forward thrust of everything. my sense of time here is completely altered.

TOWNY: sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. there was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. but he didn't. isn't that amusing? 
JOE: what?
TOWNY: enough about me. i'm through talking for the evening. now i want to hear about conditions in the west. the romance of the west holds a tremendous power over me. mother was actually a pioneer woman, can you believe it? when she calls, i'll introduce you and she'll be so thrilled.

TOWNY: i was so childish with her. 
JOE: what d'you want?
TOWNY: what?
JOE: what you got me up here for?
TOWNY: oh, difficult, it's so difficult. you're a nice person, joe -- i should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. oh, how i loathe life. i loathe it. please go.
JOE: you want me to leave?
TOWNY: no, yes. no, i mean yes please go. help me to be good. come back tomorrow. promise.
JOE: i'm going to florida.
TOWNY: this is terrible. i meet someone who -- then -- wait, i want to give you a present. for your trip.

JOE: listen, i gotta have money. 
TOWNY: oh. yes. of course. i should have thought. you shouldn't have to ask. that was thoughtless of me. yes. wait here...
TOWNY: here. don't even thank me.
JOE: i gotta have more'n ten. i gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
TOWNY: i simply don't have it, joe.
JOE: get outta my way.
TOWNY: you're wasting your time. there's nothing in there.
JOE: let go. let go of the table.
TOWNY: i deserved that, i know i did.
TOWNY: i brought this on myself. i'm bleeding, my nose is bleeding, isn't it?
JOE: you wanna gimme fifty-seven dollars or you wanna busted skull?
JOE: please let go of that table.
TOWNY: thank you, joe.

RATSO: thirty-one hours. 
RATSO: the trip is. nine-thirty in the morning we get there. not this morning but the next one at nine thirty.
JOE: these guys're good drivers.
RATSO: they gotta be.
JOE: yeah.

RATSO: you get your first palm tree in south carolina. 
JOE: how'n a bronx kid like you know that?
RATSO: i read it.
JOE: shee-it. you believe all you read?

JOE: if you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more? 
RATSO: i been thinking. i hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
JOE: keep the goddam blanket on.
RATSO: i mean new york's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'hey, ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
JOE: sounds like they knew you.
RATSO: sounds like crap, admit it. and i'm not gonna have it. i'm rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? that's agreed, okay? we're gonna tell all these new people my name's rico?

JOE: hey -- whatsa matter? 
RATSO: i'm wet.
JOE: you're what?
RATSO: i wet my pants! my seat's all wet.
JOE: hell, don't cry about it!
RATSO: here i am going to florida and my leg hurts, my hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, i gotta pee all over myself.
RATSO: i'm falling apart, that's funny?
JOE: hey, what size pants you wear?

JOE: couple crullers'n coffee to go. 
WAITRESS: where you from?
JOE: new york.

RATSO: hey, what the you doing? 
JOE: i'm zipping your fly, what the you think i'm doing?

RATSO: thanks, joe. 
JOE: shee-it, you know, i got this thing all figured out, ratso. i mean rico. when we get to miami, what i'll do, i'll go to work. i gotta do that, 'cause see, i ain't no kind of a hustler. i ain't even any goddam good as a bum. i'm a nothing, that's what i am. so reckon i'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. okay? joe glances at ratso, but there is no response.
JOE: yeah, guess that's what i'm gonna do.
DRIVER: yes, sir?
JOE,: my friend's dead in the back seat.
DRIVER: your friend's what in the back seat?
JOE: dead. dead as a doornail.
DRIVER: is this some kind of...
DRIVER: okay, folks, everything's fine. nothing to worry about.
DRIVER: is he kin to you?
DRIVER: don't you want to close his eyes?
JOE: close them?
DRIVER: just reach over and close them. that's all.
DRIVER: i guess we'll just drive on, right?
JOE: no, sir. not till miami. i'll see to burying then.
DRIVER: just a little sickness, folks, nothing serious. we'll be in miami... ... in forty minutes.
