SIMONE: in the kitchen. i think. can i make you some coffee?
RICHARD: sorry, i gotta go. i'm late.
SIMONE: in here.
RICHARD: baby, i just can't do this anymore.

RICHARD: you're just too much for me. and i'm just another guy too wrapped up in his job. 
SIMONE: fine. whatever. just go.
RICHARD: let's not end it like that. it's been an amazing three and a half weeks. thank you. and you should know that you have the nicest i've ever been with.
SIMONE: you mean it?
RICHARD: i do. it's magnificent.
SIMONE: i work really hard on it.
RICHARD: i know you do.

JILLIAN: you're running late today. 
RICHARD: jillian, you are the best.
JILLIAN: if you think i'm good at this, you should use that coffee cup sometime.
RICHARD: see ya tomorrow.

CO-WORKER #1: how long is she gonna make us come in by seven? 
RICHARD: she doesn't exactly consult with me on these things.
CO-WORKER #1: well this ass.
RICHARD: welcome to my nightmare.

RICHARD: you've got a conference call in thirty, a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign. 
MARGARET: cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,

6.: margaret i got frank to do publicity. 
RICHARD: nice job.
MARGARET: when i want your praise, i'll ask for it. is bob here?
RICHARD: i'm sure. you want him on the phone?
MARGARET: we're going to his office. grab your pad. richard calmly backs out of the office...

MARGARET: that's cute. you gonna call her today? 
RICHARD: what?
MARGARET: are you bored here? do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day?
RICHARD: uh...
MARGARET: you have another late night out?

MARGARET: i'm firing on all cylinders and you've got hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday. 
RICHARD: oh. well, it won't be wrinkled for long.
MARGARET: you'll magically unwrinkle?
RICHARD: yes.
MARGARET: you have magic pants?
RICHARD: no. i've sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles.
MARGARET: does this work on more than just your pants?
RICHARD: anything that's wrinkled.
MARGARET: buy me some.
RICHARD: will do.
MARGARET: i don't care what or who you do on your own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and i will not have your personal life affect you at work. if you want me to think of promoting you to editor, i need you sharp, focused and professional. got it?
RICHARD: got it.
MARGARET: great. now you're just a prop in here, so don't say a word.

MARGARET: hey, bob. 
BOB: ah. our fearless leader and her liege.
MARGARET: i'm lettin' you go, bob.
BOB: pardon?
MARGARET: you're fired.
BOB: what? what are you talking about?
MARGARET: this isn't working out.
BOB: you can't...
MARGARET: i asked you repeatedly to get frank to do publicity. you said it was impossible.
BOB: it is. he doesn't do publicity.
MARGARET: i just talked to him. he's in.
BOB: but...
MARGARET: no more buts, bob. i've been chief for a month and a half, and this is the third time you've dropped the ball. you didn't even call to ask him.

MARGARET: what's he doing? 
RICHARD: he's up and about to pop.
MARGARET: oh bob, don't do it...

MARGARET: what are you doing? i gave you a civilized way out of this. 
BOB: this is because i'm your competition.
MARGARET: oh, bob. you could never threaten me. i'm firing you because you're lazy, entitled and incompetent. i'm firing you because you don't work hard. so if you know what's good for you, you'll shut up, take off that ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get drunk. because if you say one more word, richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass. are we perfectly clear? bob nods. margaret good. now i've got work to do, so if you'll

RICHARD: no problem. i'll just cancel my trip this weekend. 
MARGARET: i gave you the weekend off?
RICHARD: it was my grandma's ninetieth birthday. but no big deal. you were right before, i need to stay focused. professional.

RICHARD: well tell gammy that i'm sorry. mom, she's making me work this weekend. it's not like i volunteered. i'm sure dad is pissed. 
MARGARET: she tell you to quit?
RICHARD: no. no. um. yes? but as i've explained to them, after three years together, you're the only person on the planet who can make me editor, so that's the way it is.

11.: richard your 10:55 is here. mr. gilbertson? 
MARGARET: who is this guy?
RICHARD: he said you knew each other. you weren't sure so you told me to set a meeting. we rescheduled on him four times.
MARGARET: go get him. but he's out of here in five minutes, we've got work to do. margaret leaves and goes into her office.
RICHARD: i'll charge up the cattle prod.

MR. GILBERTSON: margaret. good to see you. i know how busy you are. congrats on the promotion. read about it in p-w. 
MARGARET: yeah. well, those announcements are silly, aren't they? like everyone who needs to know doesn't know already.
MR. GILBERTSON: three years ago? we worked together.
MARGARET: don't have it...
MR. GILBERTSON: remember "dandelion's desire?" margaret gets excited.

MARGARET: oh my you read that manuscript with me? that book is legend. without a doubt the worst ever written. 
MR. GILBERTSON: you think?
MARGARET: it was a fever dream! 900 offensive and pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird disability. the paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist? oh! and there was the asthmatic alien chapter -- written entirely in his alien language.
MR. GILBERTSON: i believe there was a glossary...
MARGARET: did you see the pass letter i wrote him?

MARGARET: you wrote the book. 
MR. GILBERTSON: i did.
MARGARET: you're dante dickens?
MR. GILBERTSON: one of my nom de plumes.
MARGARET: i'm sorry if i hurt your feelings. you obviously were spending a lot of time writing, i just thought you should channel all that passion into something else.

MR. GILBERTSON: ms. mills, i'm with u.s. citizenship and immigration services, and i'm deporting you to canada. 
MARGARET: excuse me? what? this is a mistake. i've lived here since 1981. i'm applying for citizenship.
MR. GILBERTSON: you need citizenship now? after the big promotion?
MARGARET: yes. and all the papers are in.
MR. GILBERTSON: well, my office is going to reject your paperwork on monday, while we investigate whether your behavior is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the united states. we must protect our sovereignty.
MARGARET: i'm a threat to the sovereignty of the united states?
MR. GILBERTSON: yes, and unfortunately my investigation will take awhile, so you'll be deported while your case winds through the system. will it affect you at work if you aren't allowed to enter the u.s. for the next two to three years?
MARGARET: "affect me at work?" i'll lose my job!
MARGARET: oh, no. no, no, no. i won't do it.
MR. GILBERTSON: do what, ms. mills?

14.: gilbertson smiles. she's quick. 
MR. GILBERTSON: i've edited it down. it's better.
MARGARET: well then, get it published at another house.
MR. GILBERTSON: they all just don't get me.
MARGARET: all?
MR. GILBERTSON: well not all. two hundred fifty, two hundred sixty-one. ish.
MARGARET: i'll be fired and laughed out of the industry if i publish that book.
MR. GILBERTSON: i'm at the end of my rope, ms. mills. i'm an author. not some bureaucrat who brings a lunchable to work everyday and lives in his brother's garage. you're the last stop, and i'm desperate.
MARGARET: i will never publish your book. ever.
MR. GILBERTSON: there's no need to make this difficult. i don't turn in your file until monday...
MARGARET: this is blackmail. i'll go to your boss.
MR. GILBERTSON: i've spent two years preparing for this day. don't you think i've thought of that?
RICHARD: excuse me, ms. mills, risk management needs you right away.

MARGARET: know what, dante? i'm not going anywhere! we're getting married! 
RICHARD: who's getting married?
MARGARET: we are!
RICHARD: you and him?
MARGARET: stop playing around, honey.
MR. GILBERTSON: you are marrying your male secretary?
RICHARD: assistant.
MR. GILBERTSON: you are marrying your male assistant?
MARGARET: we're in love. we tried to fight it. when it's right, it's right.
MR. GILBERTSON: and this has nothing to do with my visit here today?
MARGARET: nope. true love. got it bad.
MR. GILBERTSON: you. is this true? are you marrying this... woman?
MARGARET: of course we are.

RICHARD: uh-huh. 
MR. GILBERTSON: five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine.
MARGARET: what?
MR. GILBERTSON: if i prove you're lying, you go to federal prison for five years. gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes. mr. gilbertson you. do you know what you're getting yourself into? we're going to put you in a room and ask you every detail that a real couple would know about each other. do you even know her favorite color?
MARGARET: c'mon. answer. you don't have a choice.
RICHARD: plum.
MR. GILBERTSON: you mean purple?
RICHARD: no. plum is "smokier" than purple.

MR. GILBERTSON: favorite flower? 
RICHARD: tulips. but only when they're in season.
MR. GILBERTSON: childhood pet name?
RICHARD: miss mittens.
MARGARET: are we done here?
MR. GILBERTSON: who knows you're getting married?
MARGARET: no one. with us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew.
MR. GILBERTSON: have you at least told your family?
MARGARET: my parents are dead!
MR. GILBERTSON: how convenient. so you're not telling anyone that you are getting married?
RICHARD: nope.
MR. GILBERTSON: pathetic. four questions and i've got enough to send you to prison...
MARGARET: we're telling his family this weekend.
RICHARD: we are?
MARGARET: yes. we are. we're surprising them... ...at his grandma's 90th birthday party.

MR. GILBERTSON: and where's that going to be? 
MARGARET: at richard's parent's house.
MR. GILBERTSON: and where's that located?
MARGARET: in his hometown.
RICHARD: sitka.
MR. GILBERTSON: is that on long island?
MARGARET: why don't you tell him?
RICHARD: alaska.
MR. GILBERTSON: you're going to alaska this weekend?
MARGARET: yes. of course we're going to alaska. that's where richard is from.
MR. GILBERTSON: you think you can beat me with this b-s story? forcing your secretary...
RICHARD: assistant.
MR. GILBERTSON: ...assistant to marry you and then conveniently telling his family for the first time this weekend?
MARGARET: i'm sorry, dante. did you not prepare for that?

MR. GILBERTSON: the ins will see you both in ten days for your official interview. your stories better match up on every account. 
MARGARET: there are no "t's" or "i's" in "love" mr. gilbertson.
RICHARD: i quit.

MARGARET: richard, come back here. margaret tries not to make a scene. margaret richard. richard. 
RICHARD: you shut up. you just lost your "i get to tell richard what to do" privileges.
MARGARET: well, we need to talk.
RICHARD: you want to talk with me? fine. grab your broom and let's go.

RICHARD: your plan is psychotic. 
MARGARET: well i'd rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend, but this is the big time. sometimes you need to sack up.
RICHARD: aren't canadians supposed to be nice?
MARGARET: you wanna be an editor? you need to make

RICHARD: ok. fine. then if we "make this happen"? you're promoting me to editor. 
MARGARET: i'm doing what?
RICHARD: we go to alaska and lie to my family? i risk going to jail? well, you're making me editor for that. i mean, did you think i'd do this out of the kindness of my heart?
MARGARET: you work for me!
RICHARD: you know, during my employee orientation, the hr rep didn't mention anything about me marrying you.
MARGARET: look, i came to this town alone and with nothing. i've worked my off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time? no way.
RICHARD: nice story little orphan annie, but that sounds like your problem. not mine.
MARGARET: fine. you take me to alaska this weekend, and i'll make you editor. deal?
RICHARD: no. but they have huts. teepees really. and you have to in a bucket. but otherwise, just like the four seasons. but with bears.

RICHARD: um. shouldn't we talk about what we're going to say to my parents? 
MARGARET: are you done with the press release?
RICHARD: almost.

MARGARET: so what do i need to know up there? bullet points. 
RICHARD: i told ã¢â€â˜em we've been dating for six months. we've kept it a secret from everyone... ...and that you're a naughty minx in the sack.
MARGARET: don't make me hate you.
RICHARD: bringing her home to meet my folks. she's

GATE ATTENDANT: i don't care, sir. 
RICHARD: ok then. you're a sweet lady. thanks.

MARGARET: i'm sorry, i hate it when people stare at what i'm reading. it's just... i worked on that book. 
HANDSOME MAN: you wrote it?
MARGARET: edited it. it was one of my favorites.
HANDSOME MAN: well you did a good job. it's great.
MARGARET: you don't see many guys with that book. you, uh, read a lot of love stories about roman concubines?
HANDSOME MAN: my ex-girlfriend gave it to me. i travel a lot for work. i'll read anything...
MARGARET: ex-girlfriend, huh?

MARGARET: there you are. give me my lap top. 
RICHARD: hey, he's reading...
MARGARET: i know, richard.
HANDSOME MAN: did you two want to sit together?
MARGARET: sit together with who?
HANDSOME MAN: your boyfriend?
MARGARET: you mean him?
HANDSOME MAN: you're bringing your assistant all the way to alaska?
RICHARD: oh, you can tell him the truth.
MARGARET: well, he's... indispensable.

25.: the handsome man isn't buying it. margaret and gay. takes care of me everywhere i go. call him my queen mother. aren't you my indispensable gay queen mother? 
RICHARD: that's me.
HANDSOME MAN: you're awfully nice to fly him first class.

HANDSOME MAN: that's sweet. 
RICHARD: what are you guys doing here? what's with the sign?
DEBBIE: so you're "just dating," huh? i can't believe you didn't tell us!
RICHARD: didn't tell you what?
ANNIE: we're not saying anything until you let us meet margaret. now, where's our girl?
RICHARD: uh. margaret? you need to come over here. like now. honey.
MARGARET: i have to go now.
HANDSOME MAN: what kind of sick is this?
MARGARET: have a great life.
RICHARD: everyone, this is margaret.
GRANDMA ANNIE: it's nice to meet you. now, do you prefer being called margaret, or the dragon lady? we've heard it both ways. everyone laughs.

DEBBIE: annnie! 
GRANDMA ANNIE: it's not like he hasn't told her that he used to call her the dragon lady. they're getting married.
RICHARD: now, ah, where did you hear that? the whole "getting married" thing?
DEBBIE: oh, that man from the government. gilber- something. said he was checking up on you two. said it was technicality, because margaret was from canada.
RICHARD: what, ah, did you tell him?
DEBBIE: well for one thing, that you were in a lot of trouble for not telling us that you two were getting married!
RICHARD: no. really. what did you say?
DEBBIE: just that you were coming up here this weekend. that we hadn't seen you in a while, and that we'd heard about margaret for years, but that we'd never met her.
MARGARET: me neither.

DEBBIE: so why all the silly secrecy? 
RICHARD: it wasn't a secret. we didn't tell anyone.

DEBBIE: well, is your family just anyone? 
RICHARD: no, i didn't mean...
DEBBIE: i should be mad at you two. but, but... i'm just so excited!
MARGARET: uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?
GRANDMA ANNIE: oh, we cancelled your reservation. you're part of the family now. family doesn't stay at a hotel. also, we've got another little surprise for you two.
MARGARET: surprise? another surprise?
RICHARD: she's not good with surprises.
MARGARET: i'm really not good with surprises.

DEBBIE: well you two... 
GRANDMA ANNIE: ...you're getting married this weekend!
DEBBIE: when gilber-something told us you were getting married...

DEBBIE: ...god rest their souls... 
GRANDMA ANNIE: ...or friends...
DEBBIE: ...we decided to give you a wedding.
GRANDMA ANNIE: engagement party tonight...
DEBBIE: ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.
MARGARET: are you witches?
GRANDMA ANNIE: just quaint. during the solstice it's good luck. it's an alaskan thing.
DEBBIE: we've planned everything.
GRANDMA ANNIE: i'm old, margaret. i don't have much time left. richard lives so far away, and i never see him. now i find out he's getting married, and i have a chance to see my one grandchild's wedding day. it's a dream come true for me. a dream come true. please let me see richard get married before i die. please.

MARGARET: the dragon lady!? 
GRANDMA ANNIE: to tell you the truth, we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday. just a few changes here and there, and we made this weekend a wedding. margaret stares at richard.
MARGARET: i'm a lucky woman.

MARGARET: i'm not getting out of this car until you tell me where we're going. 
RICHARD: come on, it'll be ok. i promise.

GEOFFREY: so you must be margaret. we've heard a lot about you. all of it bad. 
MARGARET: i thought it was the dragon lady?
GEOFFREY: either way.
RICHARD: hey dad.
GEOFFREY: welcome home. good to see ã¢â€â˜ya.
RICHARD: you too.
GEOFFREY: been a while.
RICHARD: yeah. you'd think you could make it to the airport to mark the occasion. grandma annie interrupts.
GRANDMA ANNIE: help him with the bags geoffrey. let's get you two settled.

DEBBIE: we'll show you around later. 
MARGARET: uh huh.

DEBBIE: balzac! down! no! 
MARGARET: what a great name. balzac's "lost illusions" is one of my favorite novels.
DEBBIE: oh. well, this balzac's got epididymitis.
GEOFFREY: and don't let him outside, or the eagles will him.
RICHARD: c'mon dad...
GEOFFREY: i mean it. they come out of that rehabilitation center mean. and hungry.
RICHARD: don't listen to him, margaret.
DEBBIE: you'll be sleeping here.

MARGARET: thank you. where's richard's room? 
DEBBIE: oh, we took down his "shrine" years ago. and don't worry, i'm under no illusion that you two haven't slept in the same bed before. richard can sleep here too.
MARGARET: oh, let's not upset grandma annie.
DEBBIE: it was her idea. anything to help get her a great grandchild. richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.
MARGARET: great. you know, i've gotten used to his breathing at night.
DEBBIE: i thought so dear.
MARGARET: i'm about 15 seconds from
RICHARD: calm down.
MARGARET: what is going on here?
RICHARD: if i know.
MARGARET: you had no idea they knew about us getting married?
RICHARD: you think i'd bring you here if i did?
MARGARET: well, we just gotta tell ã¢â€â˜em.
RICHARD: tell ã¢â€â˜em what?
MARGARET: tell ã¢â€â˜em the truth. about us.

RICHARD: wrong answer. no way. 
MARGARET: what do you mean no way? this is crazy.
RICHARD: no, crazy was lying to the federal officer.
MARGARET: well i don't like this.
RICHARD: well i'm not making my gammy an accomplice to a class c felony! for one second could you not be so selfish?
MARGARET: selfish?
RICHARD: yeah, you know, that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day?
MARGARET: how is it selfish to tell the truth?
RICHARD: look. we're awful, awful people. in the last forty eight hours, we've lied to... everyone. we need to protect the people downstairs. we can't ask these good, decent, not awful people to lie for us. let's keep the darkside to ourselves. margaret takes a second to make up her mind.
MARGARET: fine. but if we do this, you need to stop lying to me.
RICHARD: what've i lied to you about?
MARGARET: why did you tell me that you were poor?
RICHARD: i never said that.
MARGARET: well, you never told me you were rich.
RICHARD: when does that come up?

MARGARET: i don't know, how about, "hi, my name is richard, i'm an alaskan titan of industry." 
RICHARD: well, maybe i didn't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew.
MARGARET: no i wouldn't.
RICHARD: come on! you're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working in the kitchen. you're totally anti- rich.
MARGARET: i'm not anti-rich.
RICHARD: oh yes you are! and you know what makes it worse? you have money!
MARGARET: i earned...
RICHARD: ...every penny i have. blah, blah, blah. you need new material.
MARGARET: hey. watch it. you're still my assistant.
RICHARD: you were going to promote me anyway.
MARGARET: sure of that?
RICHARD: nope. not at all.
MARGARET: well, come on. if we're going to do this, we might as well put on a show.

MARGARET: i went to union college in upstate new york. it's a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of. 
RICHARD: be right back.

MARGARET: can i tell this one, honey?

RICHARD: uh. sure. 
MARGARET: i'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday. well, it was our six month anniversary and i was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do i see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run? richard! so i ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, "shhhh." so there i am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear. couple minutes later, we arrive at tavern on the green. best part, we're the only people in the place because richard got them to open up early. well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says "i didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that i would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife. margaret mary mills, will you marry me?" the group is silent, waiting for the clincher. margaret i said yes.
GRANDMA ANNIE: you are a good boy richard, and you make me very proud. i love you richy.
RICHARD: i love you too, grandma.
GEOFFREY: so did this happen before or after the ins agent came sniffing around?
DEBBIE: what is wrong with you? i'm sorry margaret. margaret doesn't miss a beat.

MARGARET: oh please. i'd wonder too. honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this. when you told us at the airport it was the first time i'd heard about it. i'm so embarrassed. 
DEBBIE: don't be, dear. geoffrey's just an ass.
RICHARD: margaret mill's phone. one second please.
MARGARET: excuse me, i'll just be a second.

42.: margaret 
42.: sorry, dropped my phone.

MARGARET: this is a delicious dog, mr. eagle. c'mon, bring back the phone. richard calls out from the house. 
RICHARD: what are you doing?
MARGARET: the eagle took my phone!
RICHARD: are you drunk?
MARGARET: your dad was right! the eagle tried to take the dog, so i saved it, then it came back and took my phone.

RICHARD: did the dingo eat your baby, too? 
MARGARET: frank's going to call me on that phone. i need it!

GEOFFREY: i know. i know. it's just...
RICHARD: it's just what?
GEOFFREY: you're only a secretary.
RICHARD: again with the secretary thing! i've told you, i'm an assistant!

GEOFFREY: just because you call yourself an "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really just a secretary. 
RICHARD: well if i'm "just a secretary", why would you want me up here anyway? sounds like you're doing great without me.
GEOFFREY: it's not like that and you know it.
RICHARD: then how is it? explain it to me.
GEOFFREY: last week, a man stuck his finger up my butt...
RICHARD: this man was a doctor?
GEOFFREY: ...and it got me thinking about you.
RICHARD: i'm not sure this is coming out right.
GEOFFREY: just shut up for a second, okay? i want you to have what i built. but i'm running out of time to show you things.
RICHARD: stop being so dramatic.
GEOFFREY: i'm not being... i need you to stop dicking around down there and get serious.
RICHARD: so this is all about what you want?
GEOFFREY: that's not what i said.
RICHARD: and me in new york with margaret? that isn't serious?

GEOFFREY: one day the woman is the antichrist, and the next day she's the love of your life? how is that serious? 
RICHARD: things change, dad.
GEOFFREY: things change?
RICHARD: things change.
GEOFFREY: things change?
RICHARD: yes. things change.
GEOFFREY: things change. that's your explanation? know what i think? i think you banged your boss and fell in love, that's what i think.
RICHARD: nice, dad. we gotta have these cosby moments more often. this is great.

GERTRUDE: they can be a little overwhelming, but they're great people. 
MARGARET: what? i'm just working on my tan. it's been a long day.
GERTRUDE: around the solstice they don't watch the clock. pretty much party ã¢â€â˜til they fall over.

GERTRUDE: i actually missed it when i was in the states. 
MARGARET: chicago, right?
GERTRUDE: yeah. since college.
MARGARET: and now you're back?
GERTRUDE: six months now. call me crazy, but i love it. think i'm back for good.
MARGARET: really? i don't know. don't you miss...
GERTRUDE: neimans? starbucks? escalators? margaret laughs. she likes this woman. gertrude yeah. i miss it. believe me, growing up i never thought i'd end up divorced and back here teaching at my old elementary school.
MARGARET: for you to get divorced?
GERTRUDE: no. i was going to teach, he was going to run his dad's business. he was like a little old man. had it all worked out.
MARGARET: are we talking about the same guy?
GERTRUDE: what do you mean?
MARGARET: well, richard's such a player. gertrude looks confused. margaret i mean he was a total player. before we started dating. six months ago.

MARGARET: that surprises you? 
GERTRUDE: did he ever tell you why we broke up?
MARGARET: we don't really talk much about stuff like that.
GERTRUDE: oh. well i should shut up...
MARGARET: no, no. please. i mean, we are getting married. i want to know these things.
GERTRUDE: he proposed to me. when we were seniors. margaret laughs.
MARGARET: i'm sorry. i didn't mean to... he proposed to you in high school?
GERTRUDE: he bought this sweet little ring, and got down on his knee. it was so cute.
MARGARET: you must have...
GERTRUDE: ... freaked out? oh you bet. i broke up with him on the spot.
MARGARET: i would hope so.
GERTRUDE: after getting rejected the first time, i can't imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you.

GEOFFREY: excuse me? i'm watching that. 
ANNIE: why is richard chopping wood?
DEBBIE: and don't play dumb. what did you do?

GEOFFREY: nothing. i didn't do anything... will you please move. 
MARGARET: i am so tired.
GEOFFREY: stop looking at me like that!

MARGARET: richard, are you... 
BALZAC: yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!

56.: margaret you can cover up any time! 
RICHARD: i didn't know you were home! i was outside chopping wood!
MARGARET: you didn't hear me?
RICHARD: i had my ipod on!
RICHARD: why did you jump me?
MARGARET: i didn't jump you. i didn't mean to jump you. i didn't know you were here.
RICHARD: you didn't see me?
MARGARET: i was running from the dog!
RICHARD: wait. were you tryin' to seduce me?
MARGARET: oh please! don't flatter yourself.
RICHARD: mmm-hmmm.
MARGARET: go take a shower. you stink.
RICHARD: fine. but don't come sneaking in there. you're still my boss. that'd be sexual harassment.

MARGARET: i'm never gonna to get to sleep. 
RICHARD: it was kinda weird seeing you naked.
MARGARET: can we not talk about this?
RICHARD: i'm just saying. it was weird.
MARGARET: it wasn't weird.
RICHARD: how was that not weird?
MARGARET: because we're... like teammates.
RICHARD: we're like teammates?

MARGARET: we are teammates. and teammates see each other naked in the locker room. all the time. it's not a big deal. 
RICHARD: well, if we're teammates can i sleep in the bed?
MARGARET: good night, richard.
RICHARD: margaret?
MARGARET: yes?
RICHARD: don't take this the wrong way.
MARGARET: okay...
RICHARD: you're a very beautiful woman.
MARGARET: get some sleep richard, big day tomorrow.

MARGARET: uh, sure. just a second. 
RICHARD: what the...
MARGARET: your mother.
RICHARD: come on in mom!
DEBBIE: well, it's your special day.
RICHARD: i gotta run into town to get margaret a new phone.
DEBBIE: will you pick up some champagne while you're there?
RICHARD: no problem.
DEBBIE: and don't be gone for too long. lots of work to be done!

MARGARET: you don't have to go to all this trouble. really. debbie sweetly looks back at margaret. 
DEBBIE: don't be silly. this is the biggest day of your life. you are coming into this family, and when it's family, it's no trouble. if your parents were with us, they would do the exact same.
MARGARET: your mom is just so sweet. i haven't had someone make me breakfast in bed since i was a little kid. richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.
MARGARET: you just take all this for granted? your family, this house...
RICHARD: i'm sorry, what? you gotta try these.
MARGARET: why are you doing this to them?
RICHARD: huh?
MARGARET: why am i here? you didn't have to bring me here.
RICHARD: you made me bring you here! you told me i

MARGARET: i didn't make you do anything. you could of said no. 
RICHARD: and what? start over at the bottom again? no way.
MARGARET: i get why a not rich person would do this. but you've got everything. it doesn't make any sense.
RICHARD: know what? this is none of your business.
MARGARET: i wish it wasn't my business. but unfortunately, it has become my business, because i made a deal with someone i thought i could trust.
RICHARD: you wanna know why you're here? i'll show you why you're here.
MARGARET: fine.
RICHARD: we leave in a half hour.
MARGARET: i'll be ready in 20 minutes.

BEK BEK: hey, richard! that the lucky lady?

MARGARET: that's great to hear.
RICHARD: see ya on the line, bek bek.

RICHARD: put this on. i'll meet you outside. 
MARGARET: but i don't...
RICHARD: ah. put it on.

MARGARET: is this really necessary? 
RICHARD: you'll thank me later.

RICHARD: so his hands don't go too far. so he doesn't...
MARGARET: nice.
WORKER: there he is! big city boy come to show us how its done.
RICHARD: ah, it's been a while.
WORKER: c'mon. show her how we do it.
RICHARD: okay, okay.

MARGARET: gimme that. 
RICHARD: i did this for five summers. dad wanted me to earn my stripes before i took over.
MARGARET: is that why you're still at him?
RICHARD: nah, i loved it here.
MARGARET: you loved this?
RICHARD: the slime line? no. nobody loves the slime line. i loved this place. the people. growing up, running this place was all i wanted.
MARGARET: you wanted this?
RICHARD: i wanted to run this place. it was comfortable here. it was what i knew. don't forget the spine.

MARGARET: i wasn't gonna forget. 
RICHARD: but then things changed. and it wasn't so comfortable anymore.
MARGARET: what kind of things changed?
RICHARD: stuff.
MARGARET: you mean, like, gertrude?
RICHARD: yeah...
MARGARET: told me what?
RICHARD: about the... you know.
MARGARET: the creepy teenage proposal?
RICHARD: ah,
MARGARET: you were a freak by the way.
RICHARD: ok, get it all out.
MARGARET: and she was right to break up with you.
RICHARD: you done?

66.: richard i know now that it was the right thing, but it screwed me up for a little while. 
MARGARET: for a little while? don't sell yourself short.
RICHARD: when gert crushed my heart into little pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great anymore.
MARGARET: so you moved to the open arms of new york city?
RICHARD: at first it was about getting as far away from this place as possible, but then i fell in love with it.
MARGARET: with scheduling my pilates?
RICHARD: with editing. see, as an only kid i'd always read a lot, but until i worked for you i didn't love it. i mean, when i realized that we could find the next cuckoo's nest, or catch 22, or...
MARGARET: ...to kill a mockingbird. it's all about to kill a mockingbird.
RICHARD: exactly! we could find the next to kill a mockingbird. damn, how great is that?
MARGARET: so we're "getting married" so you can give daddy the finger?

RICHARD: no. margaret gives richard a disbelieving look. richard sorta. ok, yes. coming back here with you... i get the promotion and i get to show off. you're editor in chief. you make a good prop. 
MARGARET: i guess that's a compliment.
RICHARD: so now you know i'm a petty am i trustworthy again?
MARGARET: oh yeah, we're good. by the way, you're more screwed up than i am, paxton.
RICHARD: yeah. thanks.
MARGARET: one more question...
RICHARD: yes, everyone at work thinks you're a lesbian.
MARGARET: that wasn't my question.
RICHARD: i know. just lashing out.
MARGARET: can we stop gutting fish? i need my phone.

RICHARD: hey ramone. 
RAMONE: hey richard. hola mi amo.

MARGARET: hey. 
RICHARD: he was my shop teacher.
MARGARET: of course he was. how many people are on this island?

MARGARET: feels smaller.
RICHARD: you got the phone i called about?
RAMONE: charged up, ready to go, number changed. ramone throws richard a phone.
RICHARD: thanks, ramone.
RAMONE: no problem.

MARGARET: why's ramone letting you steal his stuff? 
RICHARD: it's our stuff.

MARGARET: that must have been handy in high school. 
RICHARD: you have no idea.
MARGARET: should you leave the cart?
RICHARD: it's our cart. i didn't know you were such a prude.
MARGARET: i've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than i ever imagined, but there are a few things you don't know about me.
RICHARD: i doubt it. when i started, you were still wearing those ugg boot things.
MARGARET: i told you never to talk about that.
RICHARD: i'm just saying it's been a long time. i know it all.
MARGARET: did you know i took disco lessons in the sixth grade?

MARGARET: afraid of penguins.
RICHARD: huh.
MARGARET: haven't slept with a man in a year and a half.
RICHARD: holy you are a lesbian!

MARGARET: kool and the gang gets nothing, but that gets a holy i've been busy! 
RICHARD: that's a really long time.
MARGARET: that hurts coming from mr. magic pants.
RICHARD: i knew it had been slow going, but i figured there was a booty call in there somewhere.
MARGARET: yeah, well, i'm not good at that.
RICHARD: i find that hard to believe.
MARGARET: no, not that. i'm great at that. aces.
RICHARD: i'll have to take your word for it.
MARGARET: yes. you will.
RICHARD: how, exactly, do you define top notch?

85.: grandma annie back then, you had to get approval from every person in the tribe before you got married. it almost broke them up. 
MARGARET: how'd they stay together?
GRANDMA ANNIE: don't know. but i'm sure happy they did, none of us would be here if they hadn't.
MARGARET: no, no, no. i can't. really.
GRANDMA ANNIE: i don't want to hear it. it's yours. grandmothers like to give their stuff away to their grandchildren. makes us feel like we'll always be a part of your life, even after we're gone. take it.
MARGARET: well. thing is...
GRANDMA ANNIE: oh, don't worry about that. we've got these seams by the arm, this'll be easy. annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk. grandma annie we can fix this no problem.

MARGARET: we need to talk. 
RICHARD: i'm a little busy.
MARGARET: well i'm freaking out. i need to get away from here. from everyone. now.
RICHARD: go for another run.
MARGARET: no! i did that. it did not help.
RICHARD: i'm a little tired of you making demands and me just jumping...
MARGARET: we're not going to need any of this if i don't get out of here.
RICHARD: ok, high maintenance. let's go.

MARGARET: move over, i'm driving. 
RICHARD: you don't know where we're going.
MARGARET: it doesn't matter.

RICHARD: the north pole. congratulations, we made it. it's a glacier. tracy's arm. you better let me take it from here. 
MARGARET: i'm fine.
RICHARD: oh. ok. so like me, you've navigated a lot of glacier fields? and not died?
MARGARET: yeah. i'm a control freak. fine.
RICHARD: it doesn't stop there.
MARGARET: this coming from the sociopath.
RICHARD: oh, please.
MARGARET: i'd never bring me here.
RICHARD: you drove!
MARGARET: i mean to alaska.
RICHARD: are you kidding me?

MARGARET: you're sick. doing this to them. 
RICHARD: i explained to you...
MARGARET: they love you. do you get that?
RICHARD: of course.
MARGARET: and you're still willing to lie to them?
RICHARD: like you didn't know.
MARGARET: didn't know what?
RICHARD: that we were going to lie to them.
MARGARET: i didn't know!
RICHARD: well that makes you either stupid, or ignorant.
MARGARET: you think i'm stupid?
RICHARD: no, but what's behind door number two...
MARGARET: i forgot! ok? i forgot!
RICHARD: forgot what?
MARGARET: what it was like!
RICHARD: what what was like?
MARGARET: to have a family! i forgot what it was like to have a family. i've been on my own since i was thirteen, and i'd forgot what it was like to have people that love you, and make you breakfast, and give you necklaces...

RICHARD: we need to head back... 
MARGARET: alone. i need alone time.
RICHARD: what?
MARGARET: i'm, uh, about to lose my big time. i need a second.
RICHARD: but...
MARGARET: stop right there!

RICHARD: margaret! 
MARGARET: no talking!

RICHARD: watch your step, ok? it can be dangerous. 
MARGARET: again, you're not supposed to be...

RICHARD: margaret? 
MARGARET: richard!!!!!!!! help!!!!!!!!
RICHARD: i'm sorry. i'm sorry. just relax. i'll get you out of there. you've broken through an ice bridge. it happens all the time. no biggie.
MARGARET: don't do that.

RICHARD: don't do what? 
MARGARET: the thing that doctors do in e.r. when they tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to death that they're going to be ok. don't do that!
RICHARD: it's not like that. really. we do need to be careful here though, i don't want us both to fall in. stay still, ok?
MARGARET: uh-huh.
RICHARD: so, i'm going to walk up to you and very slowly pull you out. ok?
MARGARET: i'm really cold.
RICHARD: yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded by ice.

MR. GILBERTSON: we made a deal and dad here flew me up. now you tell the truth, and get off scott free.
RICHARD: you made a deal with him? on my behalf?
GEOFFREY: you were making a mistake...
RICHARD: that's none of your business.
MARGARET: it's fine.
RICHARD: the it is. it is not fine!
MR. GILBERTSON: oh quack, quack, quack. just tell me what really happened, and i'll be on my way. no one gets hurt, we all get what we want. margaret takes richard's hand.
MARGARET: it's ok. tell him.

GEOFFREY: what are you doing, richard? 
RICHARD: come on, we gotta get ready.
RICHARD: what was i thinking? they act like they're nice, but really, they're evil.
MARGARET: he's only doing it because he loves you.
RICHARD: are you defending him? are you defending the king dick?
MARGARET: just stop. think about this.
RICHARD: oh, i've thought about it. and know what i think? i think you saved my life. thank you, margaret. getting married to you is the best thing that's ever happened to me. without this, i might've ended up back here. up at the house, debbie opens the door.

RICHARD: same old, same old, around here.
MARGARET: wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so i just left them.
RICHARD: i'll let her know.
RICHARD: why did you tell them all that?
MARGARET: it was getting too messy. we weren't going to be able to keep it up.
RICHARD: don't start lying to me now.
MARGARET: i heard you and gertrude at the school. i think she meant what she said. she's a great girl, you should stay. it's the right thing. you're perfect for each other.
RICHARD: but... but what about you? what are you gonna do?
MARGARET: don't worry about me. i'll survive.
RICHARD: so what? this is it?
MARGARET: yup. this is it.

MR. GILBERTSON: i want you to say the words. 
MARGARET: i'm not doing great in the dignity department, can we not do this right now?
MR. GILBERTSON: say it.
MARGARET: i'll publish your book.
MR. GILBERTSON: now was that so hard?

102.: gertrude ...but for now i thought we'd just sit here and drink beer. ok? 
RICHARD: thanks.
GERTRUDE: you have been practicing.
RICHARD: waddya mean?
GERTRUDE: well. margaret told me that you, uh, turned into bit of a man down there.
RICHARD: i'm sorry. i'm just a little... confused.
GERTRUDE: that kiss didn't seem "confused." richard takes a beat to collect himself.
RICHARD: you're amazing, gert. and i've thought about being with you for a long time. a long time. when you said those things at the school? i've dreamed about hearing you say those things.

103.: richard but as crazy as this seems. i know now... that we're just not meant to be. gertrude pulls back like she's been punched. richard thing is... when i said goodbye to margaret? i felt sick. for the three years we worked together, i wanted to be as far away from her as possible. but now that she's gone? i'm just really... sad. i want her with me. what is that? 
GERTRUDE: i don't know.
RICHARD: i think i have to find out.
GERTRUDE: find out what?
RICHARD: if she feels the same way.
GERTRUDE: well. ok then. what's a girl gonna do? i guess you want who you want.
RICHARD: i'm so sorry.
RICHARD: but, i gotta go.
GERTRUDE: uh-huh.
RICHARD: are you ok?
GERTRUDE: i'm fine. really. go.

GEOFFREY: what are you so happy about? 
RICHARD: what? oh. well, i'm, uh, going to see margaret.
GEOFFREY: what?!
DEBBIE: she violated you. we should report her.
RICHARD: who you gonna report her to, mom?
DEBBIE: oh my he's got the stockholm syndrome.
RICHARD: i don't have the stockholm syndrome. and she didn't violate me.
DEBBIE: what is going on, richard?
RICHARD: i'm sorry i lied to you. that was an awful thing to do. but it took this weekend for me to see how funny, and screwed up and perfect margaret is for me. i think she's... the one.
DEBBIE: but you already thought she was the one.
RICHARD: no, i didn't. not until she left.
DEBBIE: really? does she think that too?
RICHARD: i don't know. i've got to get to the airport to find out.

DEBBIE: he's going to stop her from leaving! at the airport! 
RICHARD: but i gotta hurry. her plane leaves any second. i might not make it.
DEBBIE: he's not sure he's going to make it!
GEOFFREY: are you buying this horse
DEBBIE: oh, geoffrey!
RICHARD: i don't have time to explain this to you.
GEOFFREY: well then make some god-damn time. cause i won't let you throw your life away for some woman.
RICHARD: i don't care.
GEOFFREY: excuse me?
RICHARD: i don't care. i love you and want you to understand. but i'm not asking your permission here. i'm doing this.
GEOFFREY: oh, really?
ANNIE: boys! stop it! stop it! stop it!
GEOFFREY: mom, are you ok?
ANNIE: i'm having a... i need to go to the hospital. fast.

GEOFFREY: richard! she has something she wants to say to us! 
ANNIE: listen to me. you two need to stop fighting. you'll never see eye to eye, but you're family. if this doesn't stop, one day you'll regret it. promise me you'll stand by richard, even if you don't agree with him.
GEOFFREY: i... i promise.
ANNIE: and richard. promise you'll work harder to be a part of this family.
RICHARD: i promise, grandma.
ANNIE: ok, then.

GEOFFREY: what... what is going on? did you fake a heart attack? 
ANNIE: we didn't have time for your squabbling, and i knew a helicopter would be the quickest way to the airport. it seemed like the best way.
RICHARD: the best way?
ANNIE: and remember, you two promised me that you're going get along. i wasn't kidding about that.

ANNIE: larry ferris! don't make me call your mother! 
MR. GILBERTSON: ...i want my book launch to be special. i'm thinking we throw a soiree at the nevsky monastery. in st. petersberg? margaret stares at him blankly. mr. gilbertson where dostoyevsky is buried? hello? i thought you were a professional... margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain.

CHUCK: flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff.

CHUCK: no can do brohan. need a good reason for the faa holes. lose my jobby job if i delivered that favor.
RICHARD: oh, c'mon chuck!

RICHARD: well. that's it. once she gets back to new york, it'll be like this never happened. 
GEOFFREY: so, you know i think you shouldn't be with margaret, right?
RICHARD: you've made that crystal clear.
GEOFFREY: good.

MR. GILBERTSON: ...you know those two hundred pages i took out? i'm going to put them back... 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: ms. mills? would you come with me?
MARGARET: yes, of course.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT: i'm sorry. she won't come talk to you. 
RICHARD: she's never going to pick up...
CHUCK: know what, home slice? cut this chica loose. you remember beth cable? she'd totally be into you...
RICHARD: excuse me miss flight attendant, could you ask the captain to do me one more favor...

CHUCK: you're doing great, man. 
RICHARD: i know you're used to being on your own. and that you're comfortable with your life the way it is. and that in a million years you wouldn't have thought that we should be together. i know, because i felt the exact same way.

RICHARD: and you know what else i know? i know that i'm tired of being alone. and i think you're tired of being alone too. so come on. talk to me. please. 
HANDSOME MAN: do you really feel like you're alone?

MARGARET: what the are you doing? 
RICHARD: we need to talk.
MARGARET: about what?
RICHARD: have you ever thought there might be a reason we've been together for the last three years?
MARGARET: as boss and assistant.
RICHARD: things change, margaret.
MARGARET: things change?
RICHARD: yeah, things change.
MARGARET: is that the best you got?
RICHARD: now, tell me the truth. when you left, were you relieved or sad that we didn't have an excuse to be together anymore?

MARGARET: what's your point? 
RICHARD: because i am sick that you left. and if you feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be together?
MR. GILBERTSON: are you thinking about going back to him? margaret doesn't answer. mr. gilbertson we have a deal! you can't back out now!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: sir, you need to sit down.
MR. GILBERTSON: i will do no such thing.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: sir, i'm ordering you to return to your seat.
MR. GILBERTSON: who said that?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: sir, this is your third and final warning!
MR. GILBERTSON: listen sweetheart...
HANDSOME MAN: well, i'm a federal air marshall. and you're under arrest for disobeying a crew member, assault, and possible intoxication.

MARGARET: this wasn't supposed to happen. 
RICHARD: but it did.
MARGARET: i'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.
HANDSOME MAN: uh, sorry, but excuse us.
MARGARET: hey! do you think getting arrested might affect you at work?
