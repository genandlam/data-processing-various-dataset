MS.

PRECIOUS: nuffin?
MS. RAIN: ...yeah. i didn't feel so bad this time though. cause this time i thought about how strong you've had to be and then i decided that i had nothing to be ashamed of and that my mother was wrong about me, my dad and 5 or 6 hundred other things. you ask if you can help me? baby, you already have.
PRECIOUS: ...for real?
MS. RAIN: that's the for real, hope to die if i'm lying truth. now shouldn't you be out the door?
PRECIOUS: i jus help you finish up first. i got some time.

MS. RAIN: suit yourself. 
PRECIOUS: some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples. i think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel before. and in that tunnel, maybe the only light they had was one that was inside of them and then -even long after they escaped that tunnel, they still be shining for everybody else. thas miz rain to me.

PRECIOUS: come in... precious closes her window. 
CHELSEA: precious ...you have a visitor.
PRECIOUS: thas rhonda. she always early.

MS. RAIN: rita, what do i mean when the author describes her protagonist's circumstances as "unrelenting"? 
RITA: i don't know miz rain.
MS. RAIN: c'mon rita, think about the question before you just give up like that...

MS. RAIN: precious? the entire class looks up at precious. 
MS. RAIN: precious, bring your journal to me.
MS. RAIN: precious, would you come to my office for a moment? precious doesn't respond. the class still watches curiously.
MS. RAIN: preci-
PRECIOUS: nurse say i am h.i.v. positive. the air changes sharply. everything stops.
PRECIOUS: i don't have nuffin to write today and i don't hate no one. not even my muhver. my head is all dark inside so i don't have nuffin to write today...maybe nuffin never.

RHONDA: your baby okay? 
PRECIOUS: yeah. he good...won't bress feed him no more to be safe.
MS. RAIN: one time in your journal you told me that you had never really told your story. write. precious' eyes well up some more.
PRECIOUS: what for? how?! i feel like i am drowning inside a giant river miz rain. thas what...
MS. RAIN: i think telling your story will get you over that river precious ...

MS. RAIN: open your notebook precious. 
PRECIOUS: i'm tired miz rain!
MS. RAIN: i know you are but you can't stop now. you gotta fight through this. you still have to live your life and do the best you can with the hand you've been dealt. if not for yourself then for the people who love you.
PRECIOUS: nobody love me. thas a lie.
MS. RAIN: people do love you precious.
PRECIOUS: please don't lie miz rain! love?! me?! love me, beat me, call me animal, get me sick and make me feel wurfless. i had enough love.
MS. RAIN: that wasn't love. there are people in this room who love you. your child loves you too. is that clear precious? now if rita decided to just give up? would you let her?
MS. RAIN: would you?!
PRECIOUS: no.
MS. RAIN: and why not?!

MS. RAIN: because you love her...as much as she loves you. 
MS. RAIN: now the rest of the world can judge you, cheat you, beat you, dismiss you and abandon you all it wants but we won't let you give up and that's the only thing that matters. some people have less than that on their side and still manage to keep going. it's up to you.

PRECIOUS: rita's daddy kill her muhver in front of her eyes and rita been out on the street selling herself since she 12. 
PRECIOUS: jermaine say mens beat her and then her for what she is. muhver throw her out the house when she fine out that she different from other girls.
PRECIOUS: miz rain still a sort of mystery, but a nice one like the sun.
PRECIOUS: miz rain right too. these girls is my family now. they visit me at hospital when i had abdul and even take up a collection when mama kick me out. they got love in they eyes and in they hearts for me, same as i got for them.

MS. WEISS: ...you know you can use your notebook between sessions claireece. 
PRECIOUS: i do.
MS. WEISS: i mean you can use it specifically for trying to recover certain early memories.

PRECIOUS: tired of this lady asking me questions. miz rain say talk anyway but miz weiss just a spy for the state who write reports on me undercover. reports go in file. file say what i could get, where i could go and if i could get cut off and kicked out of advancement house. 
MS. WEISS: what are you thinking?
PRECIOUS: nothing.
MS. WEISS: oh i doubt that claireece. it seems like you're always thinking about something.
PRECIOUS: i don't know. it's sort of hot in here i guess.
MS. WEISS: it is, isn't it? as a matter of fact, i'm going to get myself something to drink. would you like something to drink claireece?
PRECIOUS: a soda sounds nice ...please.
MS. WEISS: what kind?
PRECIOUS: i don't care.
MS. WEISS: oh c'mon, you must.
PRECIOUS: orange.
MS. WEISS: okee dokee.

PRECIOUS: thank you. 
MS. WEISS: you know your mother's been calling here wanting to come visit.
PRECIOUS: really?
MS. WEISS: would you like her to come to a counseling session with you?

PRECIOUS: i don't know. i never really thought about it before. 
MS. WEISS: well that's just one more thing to consider before i see you next week.

PRECIOUS: 'i have just finished a session with claireece precious jones, an eighteen-year-old african american female. according to her teachers at each one teach one where she attends school she is a pen-, phen- 
JERMAINE: ... 'phenomenal'
PRECIOUS: ...success. having made strides so tre-men-tremendous in the past year, she was given the mayor's award for outstanding achievement. she seems actively en...engaged in all aspects of the learning process. however, her tabe test scores are disappointingly low... ' not to miz rain! not to miz rain! 'she scored 2.8 on her last test.' so what! miz rain-
JERMAINE: get a grip and gon' read the report and don't get all emotional about what this silly hoe got to say. anyway, if your wasn't dope you wouldn't be standing up here readin' -what, what's her name

PRECIOUS: 'she will need at least an 8.0 before she can enter g.e.d. class and begin work toward her high school e-q...equivalency.' 
JERMAINE: ...nice.
PRECIOUS: thanks. 'abdul is the client's second-born child. he's from all outwhere...
JERMAINE: 'outward'...
PRECIOUS: 'appearances, a healthy and welladjusted toddler. precious attends to his needs a-s-s-i-d-u-o-s-l-y...
PRECIOUS and JERMAINE: whatever.
PRECIOUS: ... 'and with great affection and ee... '
JERMAINE: 'eagerly'
PRECIOUS: ... 'seeks any and all information on child rearing. the time and resources it would require for this young woman to get a g.e.d. or into college would be considerable'...

PRECIOUS: finish reading this ...i know what's coming. 
JERMAINE: 'although she is in school now, it is not a job readiness program. nonetheless, claireece is capable of going to work. in january, her son will be two years old. in keeping with the new initiative on welfare reform, i feel claireece would benefit from any of the various workfare programs in existence. despite her obvious intellectual limitations she is quite capable of working as a home attendant.'
PRECIOUS: i don't want to be no home attendant! i wanna be...
JERMAINE: hush! 'my rapp-o-r-t with precious is minimal. although i am not sure with whom, she evidently has access to counseling services provided by each one teach one. she has a history of sexual abuse and is h.i.v. positive.'
PRECIOUS: she say she not put that in my file!
JERMAINE: that's the bitch's job, to get the mofuckin' goods on you! 'the client seems to view the social services, afdc, as taking care of her forever.'
PRECIOUS: that file do show one thing -that

PRECIOUS: i'm getting my g.e.d., a job, and a place for me and abdul, then i go to college. i don't want to 'home attend' nobody! 
JERMAINE: you better put this back before you get in trouble. we talk about it with ms. rain in the morning.

PRECIOUS: miz weiss just part of the gang but definitely not cool. and social worker look at me like i am ugly freak who did something to make my own life like it is. i guess i am trying to figure out just what has happened to me while miz weiss just bent on making me go wipe old people's asses. 
PRECIOUS: got to sort dis out quick tho 'fore abdul's next birthday -coming up fast.

MS. RAIN: time is up. does anyone want to share? 
MS. RAIN: okay precious.
PRECIOUS: i don't really want to read all i wrote, i jus' wanna kinda say what it is i'm writing about and how it came about.
AISHA: what happened?
PRECIOUS: well, to make a long story short, the counselor at advancement house quizzing me about mama and daddy etc., etc. but it's really about workfare. she want to send me out as home attendant.
RHONDA: how you know?
PRECIOUS: cause i stole my file from advancement house and read it.
JO ANN: next time get mine's too.
PRECIOUS: all this 'what you wanna be?' and 'you can talk to me.' they ain' no therapists on our side, they just flunkies for the 'fare. i wanna work, but not for no welfare check in central park -displacing brothers and sisters who really got jobs cleaning up 'cause i'm there working for free.

JERMAINE: and what kinda is it for someone like precious to have quit school before she get her g.e.d. to work at some live-in job for some old-ass crackers. she'll never make a rise she get stuck in some like that! 
MS. RAIN: sit up straight jermaine and watch your language. both of you. please.
MS. RAIN: now i see your points, but is stealing...
PRECIOUS: miz rain, if i didn't steal that file i wouldn't know what i was facing!
MS. RAIN: you read the whole thing by yourself?
PRECIOUS: yeah...basically.
JO ANN: rhonda home attend. say old would ring a bell when she want rhonda in the night!
JERMAINE: rhonda used to have to go all the way out to brighton beach where she work for them people.
PRECIOUS: the people had her there all day and night - 'on call' they call it. but you only get pay for 8 hours so that's 8 x $6.37 = $50.96 a day, but then you is not really getting that much cause you is working more than eight hours a day. you is working 24 hours a day and 50.96 divided by 24 is...

JO ANN: rhonda say old would ring a bell - a actual bell -when she want rhonda in the night! 
PRECIOUS: home attendants usually work six days a week. i would only see abdul on sundays? when would i go to school? am i gonna hafta go be home attendant like rhonda was?
MS. RAIN: no! so stop worrying about it. we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. trust me -no, trust yourself. my concern now is that if this ms. weiss is someone you're working with and can't trust, she's out! we gotta find somebody else.
PRECIOUS: well, i just write in my notebook till i get wif some kinda therapist i can trust. actually that always help me more than talking to her. plus, i'm going to start going to meetings wif rita for insect survivors.
BUNNY: incest.
PRECIOUS: that's what i mean.
BUNNY: well it ain't what you been saying.
PRECIOUS: what's the big deal?
BUNNY: one's where your family molest you, the other is like a roach or bugs.

MS. RAIN: precious, have you ever had your hearing tested? 
PRECIOUS: no. i never really had nothing tested...nothing like that. glasses is what i really want so my eyes don't hurt when i be reading at night.

PRECIOUS: anyway, thas all i'd like to say for today. thank y'all for letting me share... 
PRECIOUS: everything is floating around me now. like geeses from the lake. i see flying. feel flying. am flying. far up...thank you rita for getting me here on time.

PRECIOUS: ...how you get your hair like that? 
MIRIAM: oh, you like it? i do yours one day if you want. that's what i do - fix people's hair and makeup.
PRECIOUS: thank you miriam.

PRECIOUS: rita ask me do i want another hot chocolate. i do but i don't want to be greedy, even if her boyfriend do give her money. 
PRECIOUS: i'm alive inside. a bird is my heart. mama and daddy didn't win. i'm winning. i'm drinking hot chocolate on the upper west side with girls - all kind who love me. how does a stranger meet me and love me?

SHEILA: go on back there! 
RUBY: but there are no kids there i can play with.
SHEILA: do you want me to knock your other eye out! just sit there and shut up then! i'm going to talk to this lady before my gets cut off!

PRECIOUS: one day miz rain ask us to write about our ideal self...i wrote that i would be light skinned and small wif wavy swing-job hair. 
PRECIOUS: miz rain read all that and then say i am beautiful like i am. i never believe her before but somehow, today, this moment -can't say why, i do. just now...the inside i thought was so beautiful is a black girl too.
