VOICE-OVER: a way out west there was a fella, fella i want to tell you about, fella by the name of jeff lebowski. at least, that was the handle his lovin' parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. this lebowski, he called himself the dude. now, dude, that's a name no one would self-apply where i come from. but then, there was a lot about the dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. and a lot about where he lived, like- wise. but then again, maybe that's why i found the place s'durned innarestin'. 
VOICE-OVER: they call los angeles the city of angels. i didn't find it to be that exactly, but i'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'course, i can't say i seen london, and i never been to france, and i ain't never seen no queen in her undies as the fella says. but i'll tell you what, after seeing los angeles and thisahere story i'm about to unfold-- wal, i guess i seen somethin' ever' bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in english too, so i can die with a smile on my face without feelin' like the good lord gypped me.

VOICE-OVER: now this story i'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties-- just about the time of our conflict with sad'm and the eye-rackies. i only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man--i won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes there's a man. 
VOICE-OVER: and i'm talkin' about the dude here-- sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the dude, in los angeles.

GEORGE BUSH: this aggression will not stand. . . this will not stand! 
VOICE-OVER: ...and even if he's a lazy man, and the dude was certainly that--quite possibly the laziest in los angeles county.
VOICE-OVER: ...which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide--but sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes there's a man.

VOICE-OVER: wal, i lost m'train of thought here. but--aw hell, i done innerduced him enough. 
DUDE: it's the lebaron.

INSIDE: the dude enters and flicks on a light. 
VOICE: we want that money, lebowski. bunny said you were good for it.
VOICE: where's the money, lebowski!
VOICE: where's the money, lebowski!

DUDE: it's uh, it's down there somewhere. lemme take another look.

DUDE: well sir, it's this rug i have, really tied the room together-
LEBOWSKI: you told brandt on the phone, he told me. so where do i fit in?
DUDE: well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
LEBOWSKI: i'll say it again, all right? you told brandt. he told me. i know what happened. yes? yes?
DUDE: so you know they were trying to on your rug--
LEBOWSKI: did i urinate on your rug?
DUDE: you mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
LEBOWSKI: hello! do you speak english? parla usted inglese? i'll say it again. did i urinate on your rug?
DUDE: well no, like i said, woo peed on the rug--
LEBOWSKI: hello! hello! so every time--i just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, i have to compensate the--
DUDE: come on, man, i'm not trying to scam anybody here, i'm just--
LEBOWSKI: you're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, mr. lebowski?
DUDE: look, let me explain something. i'm not mr. lebowski; you're mr. lebowski. i'm the dude. so that's what you call me. that, or duder. his dudeness. or el duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
LEBOWSKI: are you employed, sir?
DUDE: employed?
LEBOWSKI: you don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
DUDE: is this a--what day is this?
LEBOWSKI: but i do work, so if you don't mind--
DUDE: no, look. i do mind. the dude minds. this will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man. i mean, if your wife owes--
LEBOWSKI: my wife is not the issue here. i hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame. i didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in korea took them from me but i went out and achieved anyway. i can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
DUDE: ah it.
LEBOWSKI: sure! it! that's your answer! tattoo it on your forehead! your answer to everything!
LEBOWSKI: your "revolution" is over, mr. lebowski! condolences! the bums lost!
LEBOWSKI: ...my advice is, do what your parents did! get a job, sir! the bums will always lose-- do you hear me, lebowski? the bums will always--

BOWLING PINS: scattered by a strike.
THE BOWLERS: donny calls out from the bench:
DONNY: grasshopper dude--they're dead in the water!!
DUDE: your maples, carl.
WALTER: way to go, dude. if you will it, it is no dream.

DUDE: you brought a pomeranian bowling?
WALTER: what do you mean "brought it bowling"? i didn't rent it shoes. i'm not buying it a beer. he's not gonna take your turn, dude.
DUDE: hey, man, if my ex-wife asked me to take care of her dog while she and her boyfriend went to honolulu, i'd tell her to go herself. why can't she board it?
WALTER: first of all, dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a show dog with papers. you can't board it. it gets upset, its hair falls out.
DUDE: hey man--
WALTER: dog has papers, dude.--over the line!
WALTER: smokey huh?
WALTER: over the line, smokey! i'm sorry. that's a foul.
SMOKEY: eight, dude.
WALTER: excuse me! mark it zero. next frame.
SMOKEY: walter!
WALTER: this is not nam. this is bowling. there are rules.
DUDE: come on walter, it's just--it's smokey. so his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
WALTER: this is a league game. this determines who enters the next round- robin, am i wrong?
SMOKEY: yeah, but--
WALTER: am i wrong!?
SMOKEY: yeah, but i wasn't over. gimme the marker, dude, i'm marking it an eight.
WALTER: smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
DUDE: hey walter--
WALTER: mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
SMOKEY: i'm not--
WALTER: a world of pain.
SMOKEY: look dude, i don't hold with this. this guy is your partner, you should--

SMOKEY: all right! there it is! it's zero! 
SMOKEY: you happy, you crazy
WALTER: this is a league game, smokey!

DUDE: walter, you can't do that. these guys're like me, they're pacificists. smokey was a conscientious objector. 
WALTER: you know dude, i myself dabbled with pacifism at one point. not in nam, of course--
DUDE: and you know smokey has emotional problems!
WALTER: you mean--beyond pacifism?
DUDE: he's fragile, man! he's very fragile!
WALTER: huh. i did not know that. well, it's water under the bridge. and we do enter the next round-robin, am i wrong?
DUDE: no, you're not wrong--
WALTER: am i wrong!
DUDE: you're not wrong, walter, you're just an
WALTER: okay then. we play quintana and o'brien next week. they'll be pushovers.
DUDE: just, just take it easy, walter.
WALTER: that's your answer to everything, dude. and let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
DUDE: well, just take 't easy, man.
WALTER: i'm perfectly calm, dude.
DUDE: yeah? wavin' a gun around?!
WALTER: calmer than you are.
DUDE: just take it easy, man!
WALTER: calmer than you are.

VOICE: dude, this is smokey. look, i don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and i know it wasn't your fault, but i just thought it was fair to tell you that gene and i will be submitting this to the league and asking them to set aside the round. or maybe forfeit it to us-- 
DUDE: 
VOICE: --so, like i say, just thought, you know, fair warning. tell walter.
ANOTHER VOICE: mr. lebowski, this is brandt at, uh, well--at mr. lebowski's office. please call us as soon as is convenient.

BRANDT: we've had some terrible news. mr. lebowski is in seclusion in the west wing. 
DUDE: huh.

BRANDT: mr. lebowski. 
LEBOWSKI: it's funny. i can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome. i've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs. what. . . what makes a man, mr. lebowski?
DUDE: dude.
LEBOWSKI: huh?
DUDE: i don't know, sir.
LEBOWSKI: is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? whatever the price? isn't that what makes a man?
DUDE: sure. that and a pair of testicles.
LEBOWSKI: you're joking. but perhaps you're right.
DUDE: mind if i smoke a jay?
LEBOWSKI: bunny.
DUDE: 'scuse me?
LEBOWSKI: bunny lebowski. . . she is the light of my life. are you surprised at my tears, sir?
DUDE: a.
LEBOWSKI: strong men also cry. . . strong men also cry.
LEBOWSKI: i received this fax this morning.
LEBOWSKI: as you can see, it is a ransom note. sent by cowards. men who are unable to achieve on a level field of play. men who will not sign their names. weaklings. bums.

DUDE: bummer. 
LEBOWSKI: brandt will fill you in on the details.

BRANDT: mr. lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money. 
DUDE: why me, man?
BRANDT: he suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
DUDE: so he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
BRANDT: well dude, we just don't know.
BOWLING PINS: crash--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.

WALTER: yeah, but he's a pervert, dude. 
DUDE: huh?
WALTER: the man is a offender. with a record. spent six months in chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.

WALTER: what if it's during a game?
DUDE: i told him if it was during league play-- donny has been watching quintana.
DONNY: if what's during league play?
WALTER: life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of
DONNY: what's wrong with walter, dude?
DUDE: i figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless. i mean she probably kidnapped herself.
WALTER: huh?
DONNY: what do you mean, dude?
DUDE: rug-peers did not do this. i mean look at it. young trophy wife. marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough. she owes money all over town--

WALTER: well you're right, dude, i got to thinking. i got to thinking why should we settle for a measly twenty grand--
DUDE: we? what the we? you said you just wanted to come along--

DUDE: yes you're wrong. this isn't a game, walter--

DUDE: but walter, we didn't make the hand- off! they didn't get, the money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
WALTER: yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
WALTER: kill that poor woman.
DONNY: walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on shammas--
WALTER: really, dude, you surprise me. they're not gonna kill they're not gonna do what can they do? amateurs. and meanwhile, look at the bottom line. who's sitting on a million dollars? am i wrong?
DUDE: walter--
WALTER: who's got a million dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
DUDE: "our" car, walter?
WALTER: and what do they got, dude? my dirty undies. my whites--say, where is the car?
DONNY: who has your undies, walter?
WALTER: where's your car, dude?
DUDE: you don't know, walter? you seem to know the answer to everything else!
WALTER: hmm. well, we were in a handicapped spot. it, uh, it was probably towed.
DUDE: it's been stolen, walter! you know it's been stolen!
WALTER: well, certainly that's a possibility, dude--
DUDE: aw, it.
DONNY: where you going, dude?
DUDE: i'm going home, donny.
DONNY: your phone's ringing, dude.
DUDE: thank you, donny.

DUDE: 1972 pontiac lebaron. 
YOUNGER COP: color?
DUDE: green. some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
YOUNGER COP: and was there anything of value in the car?

DUDE: huh? oh. yeah. tape deck. couple of creedence tapes. and there was a, uh. . . my briefcase. 
YOUNGER COP: in the briefcase?
DUDE: papers. just papers. you know, my papers. business papers.
YOUNGER COP: and what do you do, sir?
DUDE: i'm unemployed.
OLDER COP: ...most people, we're working nights, they offer us coffee.
DUDE: ...me, i don't drink coffee. but it's nice when they offer.

DUDE: ...also, my rug was stolen. 
YOUNGER COP: your rug was in the car.
DUDE: no. here.
YOUNGER COP: separate incidents? the dude stares at the floor.
OLDER COP: snap out of it, son.
DUDE: you find them much? stolen cars?
YOUNGER COP: sometimes. i wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though. or the creedence tapes.
DUDE: and the, uh, the briefcase?
FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE: mr. lebowski, i'd like to see you. call when you get home and i'll send a car for you. my name is maude lebowski. i'm the woman who took the rug.
OLDER COP: well, i guess we can close the file on that one.

VOICE: i'll be with you in a minute, mr. lebowski. she rumbles by in another pass. 
DUDE: is that what that's a picture of?
MAUDE: in a sense, yes. elfranco, my robe. my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. which bothers some men. the word itself makes some men uncomfortable. vagina.
DUDE: oh yeah?
MAUDE: yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say. whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "johnson".
DUDE: "johnson"?
MAUDE: thank you.
DUDE: huh?
MAUDE: yes, i know about it. and i know that you acted as courier. and let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
DUDE: right, but let me explain something about that rug--
MAUDE: do you like sex, mr. lebowski?
DUDE: excuse me?
MAUDE: sex. the physical act of love. coitus. do you like it?
DUDE: i was talking about my rug.
MAUDE: you're not interested in sex?
DUDE: you mean coitus?
MAUDE: i like it too. it's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. it can be a natural, zesty enterprise. but unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
DUDE: oh, no.
MAUDE: yes mr. lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these.
DUDE: listen, maude, i'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but i don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
MAUDE: take a look at this, sir.

DIETER: hello. nein dizbatcher says zere iss problem mit deine kable. 
DUDE: i know that guy. he's a nihilist.
MAUDE: and you recognize her, of course.
DIETER: za, okay, i bring mein toolz.
MAUDE: the story is ludicrous.
DIETER: mein nommen iss karl. is hard to verk in zese clozes-- maude switches off the set.
MAUDE: lord. you can imagine where it goes from here.
DUDE: he fixes the cable?
MAUDE: don't be fatuous, jeffrey. little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
DUDE: yeah, the achievers.
MAUDE: little lebowski urban achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. i asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but i tell you it is preposterous. this compulsive
DUDE: yeah, but my-
MAUDE: i'm getting to your rug. my father and i don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, i don't approve of his. still, i hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so i'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
DUDE: well--sure, i could do that--
MAUDE: if you successfully do so, i will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
DUDE: a hundred.
MAUDE: thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
DUDE: yeah, but what about--
MAUDE: --your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. and i am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
DUDE: oh that's okay, i hardly even--
MAUDE: here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. you will receive no bill. he's a good man, and thorough.
DUDE: that's really thoughtful but i--
MAUDE: please see him, jeffrey. he's a good man, and thorough.

DUDE: a, man. i got a rash. a, man. i gotta tell ya tony. 
TONY: aw, forget about it.
DUDE: yeah, man! it! i can't be worrying about that life goes on!
TONY: home sweet home, mr. l. who's your friend in the volkswagon?
DUDE: huh?

THE DUDE: he scowls. 
DUDE: when did he-
SECOND CHAUFFEUR: into the limo, you no arguments.
DUDE: man! there's a beverage here!

LEBOWSKI: start talking and talk fast you lousy bum! 
BRANDT: we've been frantically trying to reach you, dude.
LEBOWSKI: where's my money, you bum?!
DUDE: well we--i don't--
LEBOWSKI: they did not receive the money, you nitwit! they did not receive the money. her life was in your

BRANDT: this is our concern, dude. 
DUDE: no, man, nothing is here--

DUDE: i--the royal we, you know, the editorial--i dropped off the money, exactly as per--look, i've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know? 
LEBOWSKI: what in holy name are you blathering about?
DUDE: i'll tell you what i'm blathering about! i got information--new has come to light and--shit, man! she kidnapped herself!
DUDE: well sure, look at it! young trophy wife, i mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but i'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, i mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? sir?
LEBOWSKI: no. no mr. lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
BRANDT: that had not occurred to us, dude.
DUDE: well, okay, you're not privy to all the new so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for. speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? i gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
LEBOWSKI: brandt, give him the envelope.
DUDE: well, okay, if you've already made out the check. brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
BRANDT: we received it this morning.
LEBOWSKI: since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust.
LEBOWSKI: i have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, jeffrey lebowski. and with brandt as my witness, tell you this: any further harm visited upon bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head.
LEBOWSKI: ...by sir. i will not abide another toe.

WALTER: that wasn't her toe. 
DUDE: whose toe was it, walter?
WALTER: how the should i know? i do know that nothing about it indicates--
DUDE: the nail polish, walter.
WALTER: fine, dude. as if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
DUDE: someone else's--where the are they gonna--
WALTER: you want a toe? i can get you a toe, believe me. there are ways, dude. you don't wanna know about it, believe me.
DUDE: but walter--
WALTER: i'll get you a toe by this afternoon--with nail polish. these amateurs. they send us a toe, we're supposed to our- selves with fear. christ. my point is--
DUDE: they're gonna kill her, walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
WALTER: well that's just, that's the stress talking, dude. so far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
DUDE: what about the toe?

WAITRESS: could you please keep your voices down--this is a family restaurant. 
WALTER: oh, please dear! i've got news for you: the supreme court has roundly rejected prior restraint!
DUDE: walter, this isn't a first amendment thing.
WAITRESS: sir, if you don't calm down i'm going to have to ask you to leave.
WALTER: lady, i got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and i could enjoy this family restaurant!

DUDE: all right, i'm leaving. i'm sorry ma'am. 
WALTER: don't run away from this, dude! goddamnit, this affects all of us!
WALTER: our basic freedoms!
WALTER: i'm staying. finishing my coffee.

POLICEMAN: yeah, sorry, i saw that on the report. you're lucky they left the tape deck though.
DUDE: my briefcase! jesus--what's that smell?
POLICEMAN: uh, yeah. probably a vagrant, slept in the car. or perhaps just used it as a toilet, and moved on.

POLICEMAN: leads, yeah. i'll just check with the boys down at the crime lab. they've assigned four more detectives to the case, got us working in shifts.

MAUDE: look, jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with. you can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
DUDE: well yeah...i know that.
MAUDE: so dieter has the money?
DUDE: well, no, not exactly. it's a complicated case, maude. lotta ins. lotta outs. and a lotta strands to keep in my head, man. lotta strands in old duder's--

WALTER: is this your homework, larry?
WALTER: is this your homework, larry?
DUDE: look, man, did you--

DUDE: just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
WALTER: is this yours, larry? is this your homework, larry?
DUDE: is the car out front yours?
WALTER: is this your homework, larry?

WALTER: you're gonna kill your father, larry!.

WALTER: ah, this is pointless. 
WALTER: all right, plan b. you might want to watch out the front window there, larry.
WALTER: this is what happens when you a stranger in the ass, larry.

WALTER: language problem, dude. 
WALTER: maybe he'll understand this.

DUDE: i accept your apology. . . no i, i just want to handle it myself from now on. . . no. that has nothing to do with it. . . .yes, it made it home, i'm calling from home. no, walter, it didn't look like larry was about to crack. 
DUDE: well that's your perception. . . well you're right, walter, and the unspoken message is you and leave me the alone. . . yeah, i'll be at practice.
DUDE: huh?
WOO: pin your diapers on, lebowski. jackie treehorn wants to see you.
BLOND MAN: and we know which lebowski you are, lebowski.
WOO: yeah. jackie treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat lebowski.
BLOND MAN: you're not dealing with morons here.

DUDE: this is quite a pad you got here, man. completely unspoiled. 
TREEHORN: what's your drink, dude?
DUDE: white russian, thanks. how's the business, jackie?
TREEHORN: i wouldn't know, dude. i deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
DUDE: which one was logjammin'?
TREEHORN: regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. it's video, dude. now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
TREEHORN: people forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
DUDE: on you, maybe.
TREEHORN: of course, you do get the good with the bad. the new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive software. wave of the future, dude. 100% electronic.
DUDE: uh-huh. well, i still jerk off manually.
TREEHORN: of course you do. i can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. well dude, here it is. where's bunny?
DUDE: i thought you might know, man.
TREEHORN: me? how would i know? the only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
DUDE: but she hasn't run off, she's been-- treehorn waves this off.
TREEHORN: i've heard the kidnapping story, so save it. i know you're mixed up in all this, dude, and i don't care what you're trying to take off her husband. that's your business. all i'm saying is, i want mine.
DUDE: yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. if i can find your money, man-- what's in it for the dude?
TREEHORN: of course, there's that to discuss. refill?
DUDE: does the pope in the woods?
TREEHORN: let's say a 10% finder's fee?
DUDE: okay, jackie, done. i like the way you do business. your money is being held by a kid named larry sellers. he lives in north hollywood, on radford, near the in-and-out burger. a real brat, but i'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies. so if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand. he is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.
DUDE: i'll go out and mingle.--jesus, you mix a of a caucasian, jackie.
TREEHORN: a fifteen-year-old? is this your idea of a joke?
DUDE: no funny stuff, jackie. . . the kid's got it. hiya, fellas. . . kid just wanted a car. all the dude ever wanted. . . was his rug back. . . not greedy. . . it really.

CHIEF: this is your only i.d.?

DUDE: i want a lawyer, man. i want bill kunstler.
CHIEF: what are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the sixties?
DUDE: uh-huh.
CHIEF: mr. treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
DUDE: that guy treats women like objects, man.
CHIEF: mr. treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, lebowski. you don't draw we got a nice quiet beach community here, and i aim to keep it nice and quiet. so let me make something plain. i don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, lebowski. i don't like your jerk- off name, i don't like your face, i don't like your jerk- off behavior, and i don't like you, jerk- off --do i make myself clear?
DUDE: i'm sorry, i wasn't listening.
DUDE: --ow! fascist!
CHIEF: stay out of malibu, lebowski!
CHIEF: stay out of malibu, deadbeat! keep your ugly goldbricking out of my beach community!

DUDE: man, can you change the station? 
DRIVER: you man! you don't like my music, get your own cab!
DUDE: i've had a--

DUDE: yeah. roadie for metallica. speed of sound tour.
MAUDE: uh-huh.
DUDE: bunch of assholes. and then, you know, little of this, little of that. my career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
MAUDE: what do you do for fun?
DUDE: oh, you know, the usual. bowl. drive around. the occasional acid flashback.
MAUDE: what happened to your house?
DUDE: jackie treehorn trashed the place. wanted to save the finder's fee.
MAUDE: finder's fee?
DUDE: he thought i had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
MAUDE: it's not my father's money, it's the foundation's. why did he think you had it? and who does?
DUDE: larry sellers, a high-school kid. real brat.
MAUDE: jeffrey--
DUDE: it's a complicated case, maude. lotta ins, lotta outs. fortunately i've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber. i'm real close to your father's money, real close. it's just--
MAUDE: i keep telling you, it's the foundation's money. father doesn't have any.
DUDE: huh? he's loaded.
MAUDE: no no, the wealth was all mother's.
DUDE: but your father--he runs stuff, he--
MAUDE: we did let father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
DUDE: but he's--
MAUDE: he helps administer the charities now, and i give him a reasonable allowance. he has no money of his own. i know how he likes to present himself; father's weakness is vanity. hence the slut.
DUDE: huh. jeez. well, so, did he--is that yoga?
MAUDE: it increases the chances of conception.

MAUDE: well yes, what did you think this was all about? fun and games?
DUDE: well...no, of course not--
MAUDE: i want a child.
DUDE: yeah, okay, but see, the dude--
MAUDE: look, jeffrey, i don't want a partner. in fact i don't want the father to be someone i have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
DUDE: huh...
DUDE: so...that doctor.
MAUDE: exactly. what happened to your face? did jackie treehorn do that as well?
DUDE: no, the, uh, police chief of malibu. a real reactionary. . . so your father. . . oh man, i get it!

WALTER: i'll say a few words. 
WALTER: donny was a good bowler, and a good man. he was. . . he was one of us. he was a man who loved the outdoors, and bowling, and as a surfer explored the beaches of southern california from redondo to calabassos. and he was an avid bowler. and a good friend. he died--he died as so many of his generation, before his time. in your wisdom you took him, lord. as you took so many bright flowering young men, at khe san and lan doc and hill 364. these young men gave their lives. and donny too. donny who. . . who loved bowling.
WALTER: and so, theodore--donald--karabotsos, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your mortal remains to the bosom of.
WALTER: the pacific ocean, which you loved so well.

WALTER: goodnight, sweet prince. 
WALTER: i'm sorry dude.

THE STRANGER: catch ya further on down the trail.
