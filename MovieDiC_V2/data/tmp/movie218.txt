FRANK: what? what is it?
JOHN: she's not here.
FRANK: whatta you mean she's not here?
JOHN: she...she died. it's like it just happened.
FRANK: she just died, your mother just died?
JOHN: no dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
FRANK: when?
JOHN: october 22, 1969.
FRANK: christ...that's...ten days from now. how?
FRANK: johnny, i gotta know. long beat. you could hear a pin drop.
JOHN: she was murdered.
FRANK: murdered? why?
JOHN: there was this case. a serial. he murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69. the papers called them the nightingale murders. they never caught him. but the killings just stopped.
FRANK: what kinda twisted animal.
JOHN: dad, we did something. something to make it worse.
FRANK: whatta you mean...
JOHN: he didn't just kill three women anymore. he killed ten.
FRANK: what are you talking about?
JOHN: something we did changed the case...changed history. mom wasn't dead. but then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened. and this guy, this nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
FRANK: i gotta take her away, john. i'm gonna take your mother away. he can't hurt her if i take her away.
JOHN: i don't know... what about the other women?
FRANK: i'll warn them.
JOHN: that'll never work. they'll just think you're crazy.
FRANK: what can we do? you don't even know who this guy is.
JOHN: no. nobody got... wait a minute. i might not know who he is, but i know where he's gonna be. i got the case file. we know what he's gonna do before he does it.
FRANK: so what should i do? call the police?
JOHN: they will if they catch him in the act. you can make that happen, dad. you can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
FRANK: i don't know, john. i'm a fire fighter.
JOHN: i do know. i'm a cop. this is what i do.
JOHN: you ever talk to a victim's family? the one's left behind? they don't act like what you'd think. there's panic and fear. but mostly, it's like there's this logic problem. and if they could only solve it, everything would be okay. but if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it. just a glimmer. but somewhere they know. they know their world is never gonna be the same.
FRANK: what if the radio stops working? christ, what if i can't reach you again?
JOHN: then you get mom the out. but dad, those other women weren't supposed to die. we don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives. frank takes a deep breath, swallows some air.
FRANK: what do i gotta do?

JOHN: the next victim was karen reynolds...it happens tomorrow. case file says she left st. vincents at six. show'd up at cozy's bar around six thirty. she walked outta that bar around seven-thirty. they found her dead in an empty lot behind the place at eight o'clock. 
FRANK: why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
JOHN: they'll question her. whatever they tell her could change what happens. no, i want you to follow her. see if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. i'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her. when they do, you call the cops.

FRANK: what do i tell them? 
JOHN: tell 'em there's a homicide in

WOMAN'S VOICE: hey, chuck. 
BARTENDER: hey, karen.

SATCH: any word on our bones? 
YOUNG DETECTIVE: but how'd you think of it?
SATCH: you're pulling over with a .44 bulldog tucked in your pants getting ready to blow somebody's brains out...i figure the last thing you're thinking about is alternate side of the street parking.
JOHN: that's what we need here, satch. a lucky break.
SATCH: that wasn't luck, johnny boy. that was smarts and ten plus on the job.

BARTENDER: from the girls, pal. all of 'em. 
FRANK: i was, uh, i'm not really...

FRANK: i follow fires, nothing else.

JOHN: sullivan. you're kiddin'... 
JOHN: mario, you are the best...right, right, right. spell it out for me.

FRANK: yeah, it was a close call, but... 
KAREN: close! the news said it was a miracle you guys got out alive!
FRANK: close is just close if you're still alive to talk about it, y'know/ the women around him are clearly enraptured.

SATCH: april 16...? that means she was the first. 
JOHN: which means he probably knew her.
SATCH: this case just got hot. we pull on this string...
JOHN: dad...

JULIA: i think i'm gonna head up, take a shower. you wanna tuck the monster in and join me? 
JULIA: what's the matter?
FRANK: there's something i gotta take care of.

JOHN: yeah...i remember. i used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
JULIA: you're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
JOHN: she's pretty special.
JULIA: are you a good cop, john?
JOHN: i try to be.
JULIA: then i'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
JOHN: yeah. i just wish i'd told her how proud i was of her.
JULIA: i'm sorry. i didn't realize... but she knew, john. a mother knows what's in her son's heart.
JULIA: i better go. it's been good talking with you.
GORDO: i wanna talk on the radio.
GORDO: this is the space cowboy. i'm an intergalactic traveler from the federation planet earth.

FRANK: you all right?
JOHN: yeah, i think so...
FRANK: don't worry, chief. i'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.

JOHN'S VOICE: can i keep these for a little while? 
FINELLI: detectives' been through that stuff already back then.
FINELLI: you'll bring them back soon?
JOHN: promise.
JOHN: do you know this?
FINELLI: mary volunteered over at st. vincents' after school. she loved it...was going to become a doctor.
FINELLI: her room...i just couldn't...it should only be her room...you know?
FINELLI: i'm happy you found her, detective. it makes it easier...now, to know for sure. you know?
JOHN: okay, lemme walk you through it.
SATCH: mind if i shake it off first...so's i can concentrate better.
JOHN: three guys show up in both the yearbook and diary.

JOHN: the third one is daryl adams. 
JOHN: i ran him through bci...got a hit. busted for sexual assault: march 22, 1970. eight days after the last nightingale murder.
SATCH: so you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
JOHN: not the first time that's been true. i'm telling you, i got a feeling about this guy. this is the guy, satch.
SATCH: uh, huh.
JOHN: what?
SATCH: i'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.

DARYL: that was over thirty years ago. i paid for that and then some. 
JOHN: you go to xavier high school, daryl?
DARYL: yeah.
JOHN: you remember mary finelli?
DARYL: what are you saying?
JOHN: you know what i'm saying.
DARYL: no, i don't.
JOHN: well, i think you do.

SISSY: give me a couple bloodys, gus, and a dewars on the rocks. 
SISSY: how ya doin' there?
FRANK: just fine. you?
SISSY: right now, just fine. ask me later, fireman.
JOHN: sexual assault, daryl. five years. but you got lucky, right? you got away with something else. something you figured nobody knows about.
DARYL: what i know is what i told you.
JOHN: let me tell you what i know, daryl. you went to saint xavier with mary. you lived five blocks from her. you liked her. but she ain't interested. that must've hurt, huh?
DARYL: so what?
JOHN: so, what'd you do about it, daryl?
DARYL: nothing.

BARTENDER: you spare a smoke? 
FRANK: i'm trying to quite. turns out those things'll kill you.
DARYL: oh, my what is that?! why you showing me this shit!?
JOHN: nicky moore. patty ryan. mary finelli. these names mean anything to you, asshole? julia sullivan! she mean anything? she means something to me!
WOMAN: you fight fires, honey?
FRANK: yep. that's what i do.
WOMAN: i bet you do.
BARTENDER: last call.
SATCH: i gotta take a leak. you need to use the head? you can, y'know. if you want to.

JOHN: you know, daryl, sometimes, despite all the training we cops go through. despite all that we are taught about right and wrong. despite all that we would like to honor in ourselves, we can come to a place where we don't give a know what i mean? 
JOHN: you are going to tell me what i need to know, daryl.
SATCH: john.
SATCH: got a minute?
JOHN: yeah. sure.

SATCH: he ain't our guy, john. 
JOHN: just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. not everyone fits the profile. long beat.
SATCH: if he was gonna give something up he would'a done it already.

KILLER: i asked you a question, 
FRANK: mary finelli...
KILLER: who the are you?
STONED MAN #1: whoa, dude. is he okay?
KILLER: yeah. he just needs a little time kissing the porcelain.

JOHN: it's not your fault, dad. 
FRANK: yes it is...we did this. we changed everything. i've been having bad dreams, johnny. dreams where i die...in the fire. i was supposed to die in that warehouse.
JOHN: no.

FRANK: this is wrong...it's like we cheated... 
JOHN: i know... but dad, you can't go back. you didn't die in that fire. and no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. so all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
FRANK: i don't think i can. i'm not a cop. i can't. i can't stop this guy.
JOHN: but we can, we can do it together.
FRANK: johnny, i know, but...
JOHN: i need you to believe in me. to believe that we can do this.
FRANK: john, he's got my driver's license.
JOHN: what?
FRANK: he took my driver's license, john, he knows where we live.
JOHN: he took your wallet?
FRANK: no, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
JOHN: he touched your wallet! where's your wallet?
FRANK: in my pocket.
JOHN: we got him! dad you got him!
FRANK: what?
JOHN: his prints. you've got his prints. i'll run them through criminal index. you gotta get me that wallet.
FRANK: how the am i gonna do that?
JOHN: listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
FRANK: what...
JOHN: please, dad, just do it.
FRANK: okay, okay...
FRANK: i got it.
JOHN: right, now i need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
FRANK: huh?
JULIA: then you gotta hide it somewhere. somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years! put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
FRANK: i gotcha, i gotcha chief!
JOHN: it's gonna work, dad. we're gonna stop him.
FRANK: hang on.
BACK TO JOHN: getting up.
FRANK: okay.
JOHN: we're in business. just sit tight...and don't worry.

JOHN: the old neighbor's son...the cop. but he's dead. 
HECTOR: what are you talkin' about? i know this prick. he worked outta brooklyn north.
JOHN: he never died...

JOHN: just came by to wrap up over there. 
SHEPARD: glad you did. come on in. buy you a cup of coffee?

JOHN: wife around? 
SHEPARD: no. no. well, sort of. in my heart.
JOHN: oh. sorry. how so?
MR. SHEPARD: well, she, eve was murdered, detective. an ugly one to tell you the truth.
MR. SHEPARD: the mother of a cop, and they never found the who did it.
JOHN: happens that way sometimes. son still on the job?
MR. SHEPARD: nah. doin' p.i. work now. got caught up in them knapp hearings. set up by some dirty cops who needed a fall guy. hurt him bad. would've broken his mother's heart.

JOHN: you used to be on the job? 
SHEPARD: yeah, long time ago. i know you?
JOHN: i look familiar?
SHEPARD: no. what house you work?
JOHN: the 2-3. homicide.
SHEPARD: a hot shot, huh?
JOHN: nah, just working the job.
SHEPARD: i hear that.
JOHN: as a matter of fact, i caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the nightingale murders. beat.
SHEPARD: no kiddin'?
JOHN: no. missing teenager. disappeared thirty years ago. found her bones last week. buried behind some old diner, up by dyckman street. mary finelli.
SHEPARD: huh.
JOHN: talk about luck. odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. and then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it. bets part is she's the first victim. she knew the doer. i'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
JOHN: the past is a funny thing. we've all got skeletons in the closet. you just never know when they're gonna pop up and bite you in the ass, carl.
SHEPARD: who are you?
JOHN: i'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. and i'm gonna steal your life away. you went down 30 years ago. you just don't know it yet.

FRANK: you're telling me this maniac is a cop? what the am i supposed to do with that one? 
JOHN: call the fbi. use a pay phone. don't give 'em your name, dad. just tell 'em that it was shepard who killed finelli and clark and the others. that he's the nightingale.
JOHN: tell them where finelli's body is buried. they'll be able to connect him to her. same high school. same class. i'm betting they search his place they find some souvenirs. satch steps into the study...1969.
FRANK: okay, i'm on it. hey.
SATCH: hello, frank.

JOHN: dad, you there?

SATCH: are you listening to me? you're in a world of an eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment. we got your prints all over the place. plus the driver's license, frank. you gotta give me something here. something i can believe.
