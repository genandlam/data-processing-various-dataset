OUISA: is anything gone? 
FLAW: how can i look? i'm shaking.
OUISA: my the kandinsky!
OUISA Y: it's gone! call the police!
FLAN: there it is!
0UISA: thank

OUISA: we could've been killed. 
FLAN: don't say that. the silver victorian inkwell!

OUISA: how can you think of things? we could have been murdered. 
FLAN: i want to know if anything's gone?
FLAN: there's the inkwell. silver beaver. why?
OUISA: slashed ---our throats slashed. go to bed at night happy and then murdered. would we have-woken up?
3: but it's their pug dog licking her leg. ouisa picks up the dog and pets it.
FLAN: we have to go to the wedding.
OUISA: i am in no mood to go to any wedding.
FLAN: we have to
OUISA: they're your friends
FLAN: i beg to differ. they're your fr - flan stops, frightened suddenly, listening.
FLAN: hello?
OUISA: you don't call out hello unless-- they walk softly to the dark hall.
FLAN: i think we could tell if someone else was here.
OUISA: we didn't all night.

OUISA: then i'll drive. 
FLAN: i have to hang on.

OUISA: let's just get there 
INT THE WHITE WALL: the sound of the rain, the jazz, the thunder.
PAUL: bottle of beer. bottle of beer. bottle of beer.
VOICE: bottle of beer.
PAUL: bottle- of beer.
VOICE: very good. you owe me.

OUISA: be care - ! 
OUISA: let me drive!
FLAN: driving calms me!
OUISA: when you're in one of these moods you do not drive well and i do not want to be killed today.
FLAN: we could have been killed last night.
OUISA: stop saying that!

FLAN: i'm driving slowly. see. slowly. 
OUISA: i went in the room first.
FLAN: where's the goddam turnoff onto the taconic? a truck veers and almost hits them.
OUISA: you didn't see what i saw!
FLAN: it's that maria callas! turn that thing off! flan snaps off the tape deck.
OUISA: it's not maria callas. it's that truck and you.
FLAN: and last night.

OUISA: happy is the bride the sun shines on 
BRIDE: you look horrible!
OUISA: no no! could've been killed. all fine!

FATHER: what? 
FLAN: wonderful wedding. wonderful day.

USHER: bride's side? groom's side. 
FLAN: either side. i can't even remember how we met them. why are we here?
OUISA: do not make a scene.
FLAN: now i lay me down to sleep - the most terrifying words just think of it -
OUISA: i pray the lord my soul to keep-
FLAN: the nightmare part - if i should die before i wake -
OUISA: if i should die - i pray the lord my soul to take - couple in the pew in front turn. a
SANDY: is anything wrong?
OUISA: we were almost murdered

OUISA: chaos. 
OUISA: control. chaos. control.

FLAN: we always get this way at weddings. 
OUISA: i do not always get this way at weddings.
FLAN: we're alive.
OUISA: oh, it was awful awful awful awful.

BRIDE: did you say you could have been killed? 
OUISA: yes! only hours ago!
FLAN: but we're here!
OUISA: wouldn't miss it!

10: they stop in the small quiet dark clubby bar. 
SANDY: we hate to pry -
FLAN: no no. you're not prying
CONNIE: but what happened -
SANDY: this is our friend julia
FLAN: do we know each other?
JULIA: oh yes through...

CONNIE: we're worried for you flan and ouisa look at each other. 
OUISA: tell them!
FLAN: we were having a wonderful evening last night.
OUISA: a friend we hadn't seen for many years came by for dinner. i don't think you know him -
FLAN: geoffrey miller. from south africa--
OUISA: don't say it so portentously.

FLAN: geoffrey from south africa. 
OUISA: don't be ga-ga. something large.
SANDY: i didn't know geoffrey was in town.
JULIA: i saw him at susie baxter's
SANDY: i wasn't at susie baxter's
CONNIE: sandy forgets he was married to susie baxter. the waiter goes.
SAVOY: that's no reason why she can't invite me to a party.
CONNIE: he's an art dealer. julia nods now that's she's remembered. flan private sales. purchases. ouisa leans forward. somehow the telling calms her.
OUISA: we knew geoffrey
FLAN: through our children when geoffrey and his family all lived in new york.
OUISA: they've moved back to south africa.
FLAN: he was here in new york briefly on business and asked us to ask him for dinner.

OUISA: he's king midas rich. literally. gold mines. the waiter puts down the tray of drinks. 
FLAN: seventy thousand workers in just one gold mine.
OUISA: but he is always short of cash because his government won't let its people --
FLAN: its white people --
OUISA: -- its white people take out any money. so it's like taking in a war baby.
OUISA: thank you. that one's mine - they switch drinks.
FLAN: when he called it was like a bolt from the blue as i had a deal coming up and was short by

TWO MILLION: flan puts down his drink. 
FLAN: the figure is superfluous ouisa turns to connie.
OUISA: i hate when he uses the word "superfluous". i mean, we needed two million and we hadn't seen geoffrey in a long time and while geoffrey might not have the price of a dinner he easily might have two million dollars.
FLAN: the currents last night were very churny.
CUISA: we weren't sucking up. we like geoffrey.

FLAN: it's that awful thing of having truly rich folk for friends. 
OUISA: face it. the money does get in the -
FLAN: only if you let it. the fact of the money shouldn't get in-
OUISA: having a rich friend is like drowning and your friend makes life boats. but the friend gets very touchy if you say one word: life boat. well, that's two words. we were afraid our south african friend might say "you only love me for my. life boats?" but we like geoffrey.
CONNIE: i know who he is now.
JULIA: lovely man.

SANDY: didn't he invite us to visit him? 
FLAN: it wasn't a life-threatening evening.
OUISA: should we?
CONNIE: not on your life.
14: flan signals another round.
FLAN: hardly a life boat evening - ouisa sits, enjoying this.
OUISA: portentous.
FLAN: but when geoffrey called and asked us to take him for dinner, he made a sudden pattern in life's little tea leaves because who wants to go to banks? flan's voice takes us back to last night

FLAN: geoffrey called and our tempests settled into showers and life was manageable. what more can you want? 
GEOFFREY: listen.
FLAN: what's wrong?

GEOFFREY: it always amazes me when new york is so quiet. ouisa and flan relax and laugh. 
OUISA: with the kids away, we get used to a lower noise quotient. flan pours a drink for geoffrey.
FLAN: geoffrey, you have to move out of south africa. you'll be killed.
GEOFFREY: one has to stay there to educate the black workers and we'll know we've been successful when they kill us.
FLAN: planning the revolution that will destroy you.
OUISA: putting your life on the line.
GEOFFREY: you don't think of it like that. i wish you'd come visit.
OUISA: but we'd visit you and sit in your gorgeous house planning trips into the townships demanding to see the poorest of the poor. "are you sure they're the worst off? i mean, we've come all this way. we don't want to see people just mildly victimized by apartheid. we demand shock." it doesn't seem right sitting on the east side talking about revolution.
FLAN: only small murky cafes for pepe le noko here.
OUISA: no. la passionaria. i will come to south africa and build barricades and lean against them, singing.

FLAN: and the people would follow. 
OUISA: "follow follow follow". what's that song?
FLAN: the way gorbachev cheered on the striking coal miners in the ukraine - yes, you must strike- it is your role in history to dismantle this system. russia and poland - you can't believe the developments in the world - "the fantasticks" "follow follow follow".
OUISA: china. flan and ouisa oh.
GEOFFREY: oy vay china. as my grandmother would say. our role in history. and we offer ourselves up to it.
FLAN: that is your role in history. not our role. ouisa ponders this thought.
OUISA: a role in history. to say that so easily.

A STATUE OF AN ALASKAN HUSKY: baying up into the sky. 
17: geoffrey turns into the room.
GEOFFREY: wonderful view.
OUISA: the phrase - striking coal miners - i see all these very striking coal miners modelling the fall fashions.
GEOFFREY: where should we?
FLAN: there's good szechuan. and hunan.
OUISA: the sign painter screwed up the sign. instead of the hunan wok, he painted the human wok.
GEOFFREY: the restaurants! new york has become the florence of the sixteenth century. genius on every corner.
OUISA: i don't think genius has kissed the human wok. they finish off their drinks.
GEOFFREY: the new italian looked cheery. flan and ouisa good.
FLAN: we made reservations.
FLAN: geoffrey, i'd like to show -

OUISA: this restaurant - they wrap ravioli up like salt water taffy. flan appears behind her to help her. 
FLAN: six on a plate for a few hundred dollars.
GEOFFREY: you have to come to south africa so
OUISA: did you hear - to take back to johannesburg. out in eastharpton

OUISA: a guy goes into one of the better food stores - 
FLAN: dean and deluca - flan helps ouisa on with her coat.
OUISA: one of the dean and deluca look alikes. gets a pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar. goes up front. sees there's a line at the register. slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out. geoffrey doesn't get the anecdote.
FLAN: we sent it to the times. geoffrey smiles politely.
OUISA: they have the joke page of things around new york.

FLAN: they send you a bottle of champagne. 
INT MILLBROOK CLUB BAR: the chums listen enrapt. ouisa is serious.
OUISA: we weren't auditioning but i kept thinking two million dollars two million dollars.
FLAN: it's like when people say -don't think about elephants' and all you can think about is elephants elephants elephants.
OUISA: two million dollars two million dollars.

OUISA: what ever you do, don't think about elephants. 
GEOFFREY: elephants?
FLAN: louisa is a dada manifesto. about the cezanne - unless we're careful, it'll be sold and never seen again -

FLAN: mid-period. landscape of a dark green forest. in the far distance you see the sunlight. one of his first uses of a pale color being forced to carry the weight of the picture. the experiment that would pay of in the apples. a burst of color asked to carry so much-- the japanese don't like anything about it except it's a cezanne-- and suddenly the door in the wall opens up. 
PAUL: i'm so sorry to bother you, but i've been hurt- and i've lost everything and i didn't know where to go. your children-- i'm a friend of --
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR: the chums are transfixed.
OUISA: and he mentioned our childrens' names.
FLAN: and the school where they went.
OUISA: harvard. you can say harvard.
FLAN: we don't want to get into libel.
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM: paul

OUISA: are you okay? 
PAUL: they took my money and my brief case. i said my thesis is in there -
FLAN: his shirt's bleeding.
OUISA: his shirt is not bleeding. he's bleeding. paul holds his mouth, nauseous.
PAUL: i get this way around blood. flan not on the rug. eddie, get the doctor-- eddie turns to leave.
PAUL: no! i'll survive. please. no doctors - paul, frightened, looks at flan. flan we'll call if we need any -
OUISA: thank you, eddie - eddie goes.
THE WHITE TILED BATHROOM.: paul sits on the side of the tub.

PAUL: i don't mind the money. but in this age of 
FLAN: where's the first aid book! ouisa runs into their bedroom.

MILLBROOK CLUB BAR: ouisa is moved by these events. 
OUISA: we bathed him. we did first aid.
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S BATHROOM: ouisa reads from the manual.
OUISA: the red cross advises: press edges of the wound firmly together, wash area with water-
FLAN: yes! i'm doing that - hold on flan daubs on mercurochrome.
PAUL: owww!
FLAN: hold still! ouisa! i need gauze!
GEOFFREY: it's been wonderful seeing you--
23: ouisa no no no! stay!
GEOFFREY: my time is so short. before i leave america, i really should call -
OUISA: you darling old -
FLAN: have you seen the new book on cezanne?

OUISA: an absolute revelation - this'll only take a mo- ouisa rushes out of the bathroom after geoffrey. 
FLAN: i need the gauze

OUISA: two million dollars two million dollars-- 
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S BATHROOM: flan finishes bandaging paul's wound.
HER SON'S BEDROOM.,: she takes a pink shirt from the bureau.

FLAN: he's going to be fine. 
GEOFFREY: lovely book.
OUISA: please? stay?
GEOFFREY: agreed.

PAUL: your children said you were kind. all the kids were sitting around the dorm one night dishing the- out of their parents. but your kids were silent and said no, not our parents. not flan and ouisa. not the kittredges. the kittredges are kind. so after the muggers left, i looked up and saw these fifth avenue apartments. mrs. onassis lives there. i know the babcocks live over there. the auchinclosses live there. but you lived here. i came here. ouisa, so touched, turns to flan and geoffrey. 
OUISA: can you believe what the kids said?

PAUL: but your kids - i love them. talbot and woody mean the world to me. 
FLAN: he lets you call him woody? nobody's called him woody in years.

FLAN: what makes it valuable is kandinsky painted on either side of the canvas in two wildly different styles. one side is geometric and somr=r. the other side is wild and vivid. 
GEOFFREY: my
FLAN: we flip it around for variety.
OUISA: you like? you like? chaos? control? chaos? control?
PAUL: it's wonderful.
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR: flan turns to julia.
FLAN: wassily kandinsky. born 1866 moscow. blue
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM: paul looks around the apartment, so cozy, warm.
PAUL: it's the way they said it would be.

GEOFFREY: did you your parents? 
PAUL: as a matter of fact. no. your kids and i...we both liked our parents... loved our--look, am i getting in the way? i burst in here, hysterical. blood. i didn't mean to--- flan and ouisa no!
OUISA: tell us about our children.
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR: flan

OUISA: how harvard? 
PAUL: well, fine. it's just there. everyone's in a constant state of luxurious despair and constant discovery and paralysis.

OUISA: we asked him where home was 
FLAN: out west, he said.

OUISA: he's in the movies? 
PAUL: he's directing this one but he does act.
FLAN: what's he directing?
PAUL: cats.
OUISA: someone is directing a film of cats?
FLAN: don't be snooty.
PAUL: you've'seen it? t.s. eliot--
FLAN: well, yes. years ago.
OUISA: a benefit for some disease or school---
FLAN: surely they can't make the movie of cats.
OUISA: of course they can.
PAUL: they're going to try. my father'll be here

OUISA: cats? 
PAUL: he's going to use people.
OUISA: what a courageous stand!
PAUL: they thought of lots of ways to go. animation.
FLAN: animation would be nice.

PAUL: but he found a better way. as a matter of fact, he turned it down at first. he went to tell the producers - as a courtesy - all the reasons why you couldn't make a movie of cats and in going through all the reasons why you couldn't make a movie of cats, he suddenly saw how you could make a movie of cats -- 
OUISA: eureka in the bathtub. how wonderful.
FLAN: may we ask who --

OUISA: and it was here we pulled up - ever so slightly - pulled up closer-- 
FLAN: and he told us.
OUISA: he named the greatest black star in movies.

FLAN: don't say it. we're trying to keep this abstract. plus libel laws. 
OUISA: sidney poitiers there. i don't care. we have to have truth. he started out as a lawyer and is terrified of libel. i'm not.

PAUL: dad's not in till tomorrow at the sherry. i came down from cambridge. thought i'd stay at some fleabag for adventure. orwell. down and out. i really don't know new york. i know rome and paris and los angeles a lot better. 
OUISA: we're-going out to dinner. you'll come.
PAUL: out to dinner?
FLAN: out to dinner.
PAUL: but why go out to dinner?
OUISA: because we have reservations and oh my god'what time is it? have we lost the reservations and we don't have a thing in the house and it's sixteenth century florence and there's genius on every block.
GEOFFREY: don't mock.
PAUL: you must have something in the fridge.
FLAN: a frozen steak from the ice age.
PAUL: why spend a hundred dollars on a bowl of rice? let me into the kitchen. cooking calms me. what i'd like to do is calm down, pay back your kids-

OUISA: he mentioned our kids names-- 
32: flan turns to a newcomer.
FLAN: two. two at harvard. a daughter at groton.

PAUL: - who've been wonderful to me. 
OUISA: they've never mentioned you.
FLAN: what are they supposed to say? we've become friends with the son of sidney poitier, barrier breaker of the fifties and sixties?
GEOFFREY: your father means a great deal in south africa.

PAUL: i'm glad of that. dad and i went to russia once to a film festival and he was truly amazed how much his presence meant - 
OUISA: oh no! tell us stories of movie stars tying up their children and being cruel.
PAUL: i wish.
GEOFFREY: you wish?
PAUL: if i wanted to write a book about him. i really can't. no one would want to read it. he's decent. i admire him.
OUISA: he's married to an actress who was in one of-- she's white? am i right?
33: paul that is not my mother. that is his second wife. he met joanna making "the lost man". he left my mother who had stuck by him in the lean years. x had just been born. "the lost man" is the only film of my father's i can't bring myself to see.
OUISA: oh, i'm sorry. we didn't mean to -

OUISA: it's geoffrey's only night in new york. 
GEOFFREY: i vote - stay in. ouisa, flan and paul good!

FLAN: we watched him cook. 
OUISA: we watched him cook and chop.
FLAN: he sort of did wizardry
OUISA: an old jar of sun dried tomatoes--

GEOFFREY: johannesburg. 
PAUL: my dad took me to a movie shot in south africa. the camera moved from this vile rioting in the streets to a villa where people picked at lunch on a terrace, the only riot the flowers and the birds-- gorgeous plumage and petals. and i didn't understand. and dad said to me "you meet these young blacks who are having a terrible time. they've had a totally inadequate education and yet in '76 - the year of the soweto riots - they took on a tremendous political responsibility. it just makes you wonder at the maturity that is in them."
PAUL: it makes you realize that the 'crummy childhood' theory, that everything can be blamed in a freudian fashion on the fact that you've had a bad upbringing, just doesn't hold water. may i?
FLAN: oh, please.

GEOFFREY: what about being black in america? 
PAUL: my problem is i've never felt american. i grew up in switzerland. boarding school.
OUISA: there is a boarding school in switzerland that takes you at age eighteen months.
PAUL: that's not me. i've never felt people liked me for my connections. movie star kid problems. none of those. the water boils. he dumps in pasta.
PAUL: but i never knew i was black in that racist way 0 till i was sixteen and came back here. very protected. white servants. after the divorce we moved to switzerland. my mother, brother and z. i don't feel american. i don't even feel black. i suppose that's very lucky for me even though freud says there's no such thing as luck. just what you make.
OUISA: does freud say that?
PAUL: here's dinner. all ready.
OUISA: shall we move into the dining room?

36: this room has not been in use for a while. 
OUISA: don't look at the sewing machine.
PAUL: is everything okay? flan, ouisa and geoffrey mmrmmm .. yes.
GEOFFREY: this is the best pasta i've ever -
OUISA: the best!
PAUL: my father insisted we learn to cook.
FLAN: isn't he from jamaica? there's a taste of--
GEOFFREY: the islands.
PAUL: yes. before he made it, he ran four restaurants in harlem. you have good buds!
GEOFFREY: see? good buds. i've never been complimented on my buds-

FLAN: i am astonished! 
37: paul leans back and watches them happily.
OUISA: where's yours?
PAUL: the cook never eats.
FLAN: the more for us! they all laugh. paul leaves the room abruptly. flan, ouisa and geoffrey look at each other.
FLAN: hello?
PAUL: seconds?
OUISA: have you declared your major yet?
PAUL: you're like all parents. what's your major?
FLAN: geoffrey, harvard has all those great titles the students give courses.
OUISA: the holocaust and ethics?
FLAN: krauts and doubts.
OUISA: i think we're lucky having this dinner. isn't this the finest time? a toast to you.
GEOFFREY: to cats!
FLAN: blunt question. what's he like?
38: ouisa reaches for the bottle of wine.
OUISA: let's not be star
FLAN: i'm not a star
PAUL: my father, being an actor, has no real identity. you say to him, pop, what's new? and he says, 'i got an interesting script today. i was asked to play a lumberjack up in the yukon. now, i've been trained as a preacher, but my church fell apart. my wife says we have to get mbney to get through this winter. and i sign up as part of this team where all my beliefs are challenged. but i hold firm. in spite of prejudice because i want to get back to my wife. out of this forest,back to the church... .' and my father is in tears and i say pop, this i:. not a real event, this is some script that was sent to you. and my father says ' i' m trying it out to see how it fits on me.' but he has no life--he has no memory--only the scripts producers send him in the mail through his agents. that's his past.

OUISA: i just loved the kid so much. i wanted to reach out to him. 
FLAN: and then we asked him what his thesis was on.

PAUL: well... 
HIS CHAIR): a substitute teacher out on long island was dropped from his job for fighting with a student. a few weeks later, the teacher returned to the classroom, shot the student
FLAN: i haven't read it in years.
PAUL: i borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine because i wanted to see what she had underlined and i read this book to find out why this touching, beautiful, sensitive story published in july 1951 had turned into this manifesto of hate. i started reading. : it's exactly as i remembered. everybody's a phoney. page two: "my brother's in hollywood being a prostitute." page three: "what a phony slob his father was." page nine: "people never notice anything." then on page twenty two my hair stood up. remember holden caulfield--the definitive sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap. "a deer hunter hat? like it is. i sort of closed one eye like i was taking aim at it. this is a people shooting hat. i shoot people in this hat."

PAUL: hmmm, i said. this book is preparing people for bigger moments in their lives than i ever dreamed of. then on p. 89 "i'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. i hate fist fights...what scares me most is the other guy's face..." i finished the book. it's a touching story, comic because the boy wants to do so much and can't do anything. hates all phoniness and only lies to others. wants everyone to like him, is only hateful, and is completely self involved. in other words, a pretty accurate picture of a male adolescent. flan, ouisa, .geoffrey are transfixed. and what alarms me about that book--not the book so much as the aura about it--is this: the book is primarily about paralysis. the boy can't function. and at the end before he can run away and start a new life, it starts to rain and he folds. now there's nothing wrong in writing about emotional and intellectual paralysis. it may indeed thanks to chekhov and samuel beckett be the great modern theme. the extraordinary last lines of waiting for godot--"let's go." "yes, let's go." stage directions: they do not move. but the aura around this book of salinger's-- which perhaps should be read by everyone ut young men---is this: it mirrors like a fun house mirror and amplifies like a distorted speaker one of the great tragedies of our times- --the death of the imagination. because what else is paralysis? the camera moves closer and closer in on paul. 
42: the imagination has been so debased that

PAUSE.: flan, geoffrey, ouisa are very moved. 
OUISA: well, indeed.
FLAN: i hope your muggers read every word.
42: ouisa

GEOFFREY: i'm going to buy a copy of catcher i. the rye at the airport and read it. 
OUISA: cover to cover
PAUL: i'll test you. i should be going. paul starts to go. they follow.

FLAN: where will you stay? 
OUISA: not some flea bag.
PAUL: i get into the sherry tomorrow morning. it's not so far off. i can walk around. i don't think they'll mug me twice in one evening.

OUISA: you'll stay here tonight. 
PAUL: no! i have to be at the hotel at seven am sharp!
OUISA: we'll get you up.
PAUL: or dad will have a fit.
QUISA: up at six fifteen which is any moment now and we have that wedding in millbrook-

FLAN: there's an alarm by the bed 
OUISA: your feet might hang out over the end
PAUL: if it's any problem--
FLAN: it's only a problem if you leave.
PAUL: six fifteen? i'll tip toe out.
FLAN: and we want to be in cats.

PAUL: it's done. 
GEOFFREY: i'll fly back. with my wife.
OUISA: pushy. both of you.
PAUL: he's not. dad said i could be in charge of the extras. you'd just be extras. that's all i can promise.
FLAK: in cat suits?
PAUL: no. you can be humans.
FLAN: that's very important. it has to be in our contracts. we are humans.
44: they all return down

GEOFFREY: we haven't got any business done tonight. 
FLAN: forget it. it was only an evening at home.
OUISA: whatever you do, don't think about elephants. geoffrey puts on his overcoat.
PAUL: did i intrude? flan and ouisa no!
PAUL: i'm sorry - oh christ - geoffrey

_ PAUL: let me clean up - 
45: ouisa follows.
OUISA: hal leave it for -
PAUL: nobody comes in on sunday.
OUISA: yvonne will be in on tuesday.
PAUL: you'll have every bug in christendom -
OUISA: let me - paul takes the dishes.
PAUL: no. you watch. it gives me a thrill to be looked at.

FLAN: he's in. 
OUISA: he's in?
FLAN: he's in for two million.

OUISA: two million! 
FLAN: he says the cezanne is a great inv1stment. we should get it for six million and sell it to the tokyo bunch for ten.
OUISA: happy days! oh
PAUL: two million dollars?
THE LIVING ROOM.: flan picks up the slide carousel and kisses it.
FLAN: figure it out. he doesn't have the price of -a dinner but he can cough up two million dollars and the japs will go ten! paul and ouisa come into the living room.
PAUL: go to ten? ten million?
OUISA: break all those dishes! two million! go to ten! and we put up nothing?
PAUL: nothing?
FLAN: geoffrey sold that hockney print i know he
PAUL: your kids said you were an art dealer. but you don't have a gallery. i don't understand -

FLAN: people want to sell privately. 
OUISA: a modern.. impressionist. renaissance.
FLAN: but don't want museums to know where it is.
OUISA: japanese.
FLAN'S OFFICE.: flan flicks on his computer.
FLAN: i've got japanese looking for a cezanne. i have a syndicate that will buy the painting. there is this great second level cezanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce. flan holds up the slide.
OUISA: wife doesn't want hubby to know she owns a cezanne. paul looks at the slide.
FLAN: i needed an extra two million. geoffrey called. invited him here for dinner.
OUISA: tonight was a very nervous very casual very big thing.
PAUL: i couldn't tell -

OUISA: all the better. 0 
THE MASTER BEDROOM.: paul follows flan and ouisa into their bedroom.
PAUL: i'm glad i helped -
OUISA: you were wonderful!
PAUL: i'm so pleased i was wonderful.

FLAN: for a while. we almost lost it. if i didn't get this money,. ouis, i would've lost the cezanne. it would've gone. i had nowhere to get it. ouisa gets out of bed and comes to flan.
OUISA: why don't you tell me how much these things mean? you wait till the last minute - ouisa and flan get into bed.

FLAN: --the details he knew--how would he know about the painting? 
FLAN: although i think it's a very fine kandinsky.
OUISA: and none of you knows this fellow? he has this wild quality--yet, a real elegance and a real concern and a real consideration. tess looks at the floral arrangement paul sent. it's only slightly wilted.
TESS: well, mom, you should have let him stay. you should have divorced all your children and just let this dreamboat stay. plus he sent you flowers.
FLAN: and jam .
THE KIDS: oooooo.
OUISA: i wish i knew how to get hold of his father. just to see if there is any truth in it.

FLAN: and a new character entered our story

72: flan and ouisa and kitty and larkin he's making a movie of cats. 
DR. FINE: and he told me the name of a matinee idol of my youth. somebody who had really forged ahead and made new paths for blacks just by the strength of-his own talent. strangely, i had identified with him, before i started medical school. i mean, i'm a jew. my grandparents were killed in the war. i had this sense of self-hatred, of fear. and this kid's father - the bravery of his films - had given me a direction, a confidence. simple as that. we're always paying off debts. then my beeper went off. a patient in her tenth month of labor. her water finally broke. i gave'him the keys.

PAUL: doug's told me all about your brownstone. how you got it at a great price because there had been a murder in it and for a while people thought it had a curse but you were a scientific man and were courageous! 
DR. FINE: well, yes! courageous!
DR. FINE'S OFFICE: fla.n and ouisa, kitty and larkin agree.
FLAN: very courageous.
DR. FINE: i ran off to the delivery room. twins! two boys. i thought of my son. i dialed my boy at dartmouth. amazingly, he was in his room. doing y hat i hate to ask.

THE BROWNSTONE.: they hear a debussy quartet playing. 
DR. FINE: arrest him! dr. fine snaps off the radio.
PAUL: pardon?
DR. FINE: breaking and entering.
PAUL: breaking and entering?
DR. FINE: you're an imposter.
PAUL: officer, your honor, your eminence, dr. fine cave me the keys to his brownstone. isn't that so?
DR. FINE: my son doesn't know you.
PAUL: this man gave me the keys to the house. isn't that so?
POLICEMAN: did you give him the key to the house?
DR. FINE: yes, but under false pretenses. this black kid crack addict comes into my office

75: paul 
DR. FINE: i want you to arrest this fraud.
DR. FINE: stop him!
COLLEGE DORM ROOM: doug continues his tirade.
DOUG: a cretin! a creep! no wonder mother left you! doug flings the phone against the wall.

OUISA: we went down to the strand - 
FLAN: five sherlock holmeses-

OUISA: "back in new york with juanita and the children, i began to become aware that our marriage, while working on some levels, was falling apart in other fundamental areas." flan takes the book. 
FLAN: there's a picture of him and his four- daughters. no sons. four daughters.

FLAN: the book's called this life. 
A CONCERT-GOER: no sons?
OUISA: no sons!

KITTY: oh dear. 
OUISA: this kid bulldozing his way into our lives.

FLAN: agatha christie would ask what do we all have in common? 
OUISA: it seems the common thread linking us all is an overwhelming need to be in the movie of cats.
KITTY: our kids. struggling through their lives.
LARKIN: i don't want to know anything about the spillover of their lives.
OUISA: all we have in common is our children went to boarding school together. flan how come we never met?
DR. FINE: his mother had custody. i lived out west. after he graduated from high school, she moved west. i moved east.
LARKIN: i think we should drop it right here.
KITTY: are you afraid ben is mixed up in this fraud?
LARKIN: i don't want to know too much about my kid.
KITTY: you think ben is hiding things from us? i tell you, i'm getting to the bottom of this. my son has no involvements with any black frauds. doctor, you said something about crack?

LARKIN: i don't want to know. 
DR. FINE: it just leaped out of my mouth.
FLAN: we'll take a vote. do we pursue this to the end no matter what we find out about our kids?
OUISA: i vote yes.
DR. FINE: i trust doug. yes.
LARKIN: no.
KITTY: yes.
FLAN: yes.
KITTY: listen to the last page. ".. .making it better for our children. protecting them. from what? the truth is what we were protecting those little people from... there is a lot to worry about and i'd better start telling the little - start worrying!" the end. kitty closes the book in dismay.

FLAN: we all went up to harvard. 
OUISA: we had to enlist our children -

INT ELIOT HOUSE HARVARD: the five parents sit in the empty dining commons. they've come for lunch. and now lunch is over. 
FLAN: it's obvious. it's somebody you went to high school with, since you go to different colleges.
DR. FINE: i just want to tell you how i appreciate your coming today -
DOUG: dad? spare me?
OUISA: he knows the details about our lives.
FLAN: who in your high school, part of your gang, has become homosexual or is deep into drugs?
TESS: that's like about fifteen people.
LARKIN: i don't want to know.
TESS: i find it really insulting that you would assume that it has to be a guy. this movie star's son could have had a relationship with a girl in

HEN: that's your problem in a nut shell. you're so limited. 
TESS: that's why i'm going to afghanistan.
OUISA: you are not climbing mountains.
FLAN: we have not invested all this money in you to scale the face of k-2.
TESS: is that all i am? an investment?
OUISA: all right. track down everybody in your high school class. male. female. whatever. not just homosexuals. drug addicts. the kid might be a drug dealer. doug throws back his chair.
DOUG: why do you look at me when you say that? do you think i'm an addict? a drug pusher? i really resent the accusations.
DR. FINE: no one is accusing you of anything. sit down. larkin gets up and paces around the table.
LARKIN: i don't want to know. i don't want to know. i don't want to know.
FLAN: nobody is accusing anyone of anything.

BEN: he promised you parts in cats? 
OUISA: it wasn't just that. it was fun.
TESS: you went to cats. you said it was an all time low in a lifetime of theater going. ouisa considers.
OUISA: film is a different medium.
TESS: you said aeschylus did not invent theater to have it end up a bunch of chorus kids wondering which of them will go to kitty kat heaven.
OUISA: i don't remember saying that.
FLAN: no, i think that was starlight express -
TESS: well, maybe he'll make a movie of starlight express and you can all be on roller skates! the kids stand up.
DOUG: this is so humiliating.
BEN: this is so pathetic.
TESS: this is so racist.
OUISA: this is not racist!
THE CORRIDOR.: their parents run ahead trying to circle them.

DOUG: how can i get in touch with anybody in high school? i've outgrown them. 
KITTY: now can you outgrow them? you graduated a year ago!

OUISA: here is a copy of your yearbook. i want you to get the phone numbers of everybody in your class. you all went to the same boarding school. 
DR. FINE: you can charge it to my phone.
OUISA: call everyone in your class and ask them if they know--
DOUG: never!
TESS: this is the kgb.
DR. FINE: you're on the phone all the time. now i ask you to make calls all over the country and you become reticent.
TESS: this is the entire mccarthy period. woody saunters up to his parents. he is very cool.
WOODY: i just want to get one thing straight.

FLAN: finally, we hear from the peanut gallery. 
WOODY: you gave him my pink shirt? you gave a complete stranger my pink shirt? that pink shirt was a christmas present from you. i treasured that shirt. i loved that shirt. my collar size has grown a full size from weight lifting. and you saw my arms had grown, you saw my neck had grown. and you bought me that shirt for my new body. i loved that shirt. the first shirt for my new body. and you gave that shirt away. i can't believe it. i hate this life. i hate you.

DOUG: you never do anything for me. 
TESS: you've never done anything but tried to block me.
BEN: i'm only this pathetic extension of your eighth rate personality.
DOUG: social darwinism pushed beyond all limits.
WOODY: you gave away my pink shirt?
TESS: you want me to be everything you weren't.
DOUG: you said drugs and looked at me.

CUT TO: pages of a yearbook turning. the pages stop. 
TESS: trent conway. -

TESS: trent conway. 
DOUG: look at those beady eyes staring out at me.
BEN: trent conway.
WOODY: he's at mit.

TESS: so i went to mit. he was there in his computer room and i just pressed him and pressed him and pressed him. i had this strapped to me. tess puts a small tape recorder on the desk. tess turns it on. ouisa listens to the tape.

PAUL: tell me about these people, man! 
TRENT: i just want to look at you. sorry.
PAUL: are these all rich people?
TRENT: no. hand to mouth on a higher plateau.

PAUL: i think it must be very hard to be with rich people. you have to have money. you have to give them presents. 
TRENT: not at all. rich people do something nice for you, you give them a pot of jam.
PAUL: that's what pots of jam are for?
TRENT: orange. grapefruit. strawberry. but fancy. they have entire stores filled with fancy pots of jam wrapped in cloth. english. or french.
PAUL: i'll tell you what i'll do. i pick a name. you tell me about them. where they live. secrets. and for each name you get a piece of clothing.
TRENT: all right.

TRENT CONWAY'S APARTMENT: trent catches paul's sneaker joyously.

PAUL: bodd-ill a bee-ya.

TRENT: we went through the address book letter by letter. paul vanished by the l's. he took the address book with him. well, he's already been in all your houses. maybe i will meet him again. i sure would like to. 
TESS: his past? his real name?

TESS: he took stuff from you?
TRENT: besides the address book? he took my stereo and sport jacket and my word processor and my laser printer. and my skis. and my tv.
