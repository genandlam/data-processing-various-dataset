speaker1: they found her dead in a cabin round saguaro pass, twenty miles west of here.
speaker1: deed was in your name.
speaker1: dead with a hole in her chest, in your cabin, plus your sterling reputation equals guilty as sin. and you're gonna hang for it.

speaker1: blue light... clanton said he saw blue light before the cows disappeared... 
speaker2: just a storm.

speaker1: no storm i've ever seen... i say we wait 'til it passes. 
speaker2: no time, they put him in an iron coach.

speaker3: you lovebirds have a nice trip now.
speaker4: you sure he's a bad guy, pa? he did give percy a lickin'.
speaker5: he's bad enough.
speaker4: . can i come with you?
speaker5: too dangerous.

speaker1: dangerous to drive a coach? why can't charlie just take him? 
speaker2: because it's my job, emmett. that's what these people pay me to do. and your mother would kill me if i brought you. emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --
speaker1: good thing she's already dead then.

speaker1: is it... dead? 
speaker2: . the j,,a it?
speaker3: a demon.
speaker3: revelations 16:14: "for there are spirits of demons, showing signs." escaped from itself.
speaker1: lookit its wrist! it's got one'a those bracelet things too!
speaker4: i think... it's comin' from somewhere inside it.
speaker2: only one way to find out. we need to cut it open.
speaker2: you're a doctor. got a bone saw?
speaker5: . are you... serious?

speaker1: well this one here's our only chance of findin' where they went. 
speaker2: so you got a bone saw or don't you?

speaker1: gimme my scalpel. 
speaker2: where'd it go? the hell'd you do?
speaker1: nothing, just pulled it off --

speaker1: only works when it's touching the creature. 
speaker2: i think... it's a compass. look: no matter how you move it, it points in the same direction.
speaker3: compasses point north. that's west.
speaker4: west's where 141 came from.
speaker3: if you're right, what's it pointing to?
speaker5: the rest of 'em.
speaker5: be my guess.
speaker6: then that's where i'm goin'.
speaker6: one of my ranchers said my herd disappeared into the sky. 'til about ten minutes ago, i figured him for a liar. nobody takes my cattle.
speaker4: your b was taken too.
speaker6: i noticed.
speaker2: what if they're already dead?
speaker3: they're not dead.

speaker1: kid's right. if all they wanted was to kill us, they would've. 
speaker2: looked to me like... they were ropin' people.
speaker2: means they need 'em for something. whatever it is, we can either stand here guessin'... or go find out.
speaker3: if she's alive -- if there's even a

speaker1: lord hates a coward... but our bullets were useless against those things. other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and outnumbered. 
speaker2: whoa, i got nothing to do with this --
speaker3: you got everything to do with it. if you can remember where you got that thing --
speaker2: i remember you all wantin' me on the end of a rope. whatever's happenin' here's got nothin' to do with me.

speaker1: if you're walkin' away from here, what the hell're you walking tsq?
speaker2: what the are you walkin' to, lady? 'cause if i heard right, it sounds like suicide to me.

speaker1: i... just wanna help these people. 
speaker2: you wanna help yourself. saw your face light up the minute you knew that thing might lead you to gold.
speaker1: it's not gold i want, you it's what it'll buy me.

speaker2: you know i can't say.
speaker1: the last thing i said to her... i... please. if i'm wrong about my wife... i don't want to die angry.
speaker2: you can ask maria if she was cheatin' on you once we get her back. 'til then? don't die.
speaker3: and off doc, thunder cracks --

speaker1: you missed a spot. 
speaker2: the hell,-re- you doing here?
speaker1: mindin' my own business. then you decided to take a shower.
speaker2: why didn't you say anything?
speaker1: givin' you privacy.
speaker2: . she's pretty. who was she?
speaker1: only thing i know's her name was alice...
speaker1: and she's dead.

speaker1: maybe you loved her. 
speaker2: all you women are the same -- always wanna make it about "love."
speaker1: trust me, lonergan. i'm not the same.
speaker2: don't matter.
speaker1: so what dj= matter?
speaker2: what matters is i find the thing that killed her. and make it pay.

speaker1: where'd you see this before? 
speaker1: -- and don't lie to me. you wouldn't've asked me if you didn't recognize it.
speaker1: those things... they the ones who put those marks on your back?

speaker1: they took my people. destroyed where i'm from. 
speaker2: where's that?
speaker1: north of here. been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town. best i figure, they're hidin' in a mine.
speaker2: maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me --
speaker1: -- what, you would've stuck around? i couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than i could've stopped these people from going after their kin.
speaker1: truth ain't worth a damn, jake... and we're gonna need all the guns we can get.
speaker2: so that's the only reason you wanted me to come with you? cause of my gun?
speaker1: no, not your gun.
speaker1: what you do with it.

speaker1: go after the boy... then you get our people back... 
speaker2: stop talking. dqw! get your ass-- but meacham grabs jake, eye to eye. gasping:
speaker1: listen up... 'cause i'm not gonna be able to say it again -- don't care who you were, son... only who you mg.

speaker1: that thing... was dead... it was d-ead... 
speaker2: i couldn't stop it -- it just... grabbed the kid.

speaker2: you're a coward. you work for me, dammit. you're my m e 1 1 qyees.
speaker1: fine line between a coward and a fool.

speaker2: two hundred head of cattle!

speaker1: and how do i know you'll come back? 
speaker2: you can keep my associate here. if i don ' t come back, you can kill him.
speaker1: why should i believe that you even care about this man?
speaker2: because he's my son.
speaker1: is this true?
speaker3: yeah... he's my father.
speaker1: three hundred head.

speaker1: two fifty. 
speaker2: cut him loose.
speaker3: hey! what about =?!?
speaker1: what about you, kid?
speaker2: kill all of them except the half-breed.
speaker4: what're you waiting for, asshole? do it. and as jake's about to meet his death:

speaker1: . what... happened? 
speaker2: you... died.

speaker1: if i'd told you on the boat, you never would'a trusted me -- 
speaker2: did you hear what i said?
speaker1: .. what?
speaker2: when you were playin' possum. did you hear what i mid?
speaker1: no. i was mendin'.
speaker1: it's like sleep.
speaker2: how's it you look like one of us?
speaker1: i can look like whatever i want to.
speaker2: so you can't die?

speaker1: sure i can. if my heart stops beating... just like you. 
speaker2: you're nothin' like me, ella. you're one'a them.
speaker1: i'm not, jake. i'm from a different place.
speaker3: the one that took you.
speaker3: it killed her.
speaker1: they call him the slaver. he's the one, gave me the scars. broke me. and made me watch... while he killed my family too.

speaker1: our race was first to map the stars... that's why they came for us. took our planet, piece by piece. slaughtered anyone who fought hack. ones who survived were turned into slaves. trackers. 
speaker1: they brought me aboard one of their scout ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to find other planets like mine. planets they can take... people they can enslave.
speaker2: x lead 'em here.
speaker3: well damn, lady, thanks a 1.
speaker1: i never wanted this. but they got... ways. of making you do things.
speaker1: been tryin' to make it right... tried to blow the ship to by burnin' up all their fuel, then escaped down here.
speaker1: 'cept it didn't work... thing survived.
speaker2: where is it.
speaker1: hiding in that cloud. way i figure, they'll find enough fuel to leave by tomorrow, midday. then they'll bring back the others.

speaker1: "others"? 
speaker2: the whole fleet. they'll take what they need. everyone on this planet. anything too weak to survive... they'll toss. like that cow.
speaker3: what'd you mean, they're looking for "fuel"...?
speaker4: gold. that's why they're in a mine.
speaker2: . wherever it is, that's where you escaped from -- and it's the only way back up to the ship.
speaker2: even with your memory wiped, your instincts kicked in --
speaker2: that's how it works, jake, the bracelet reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it reacts. somehow you took it off one of 'em... don't you remember any of it?
speaker4: i-- i blasted my way out...

speaker1: i remember seeing a tower... made of stone... on the rim of a canyon... 
speaker2: what? what's he sayin'?!?
speaker3: that rock you're talkin' about... he- knows where it is.

speaker1: you... all right...? 
speaker2: . fantastic. you?

speaker1: this is kiowa land, their sister tribe. 
speaker2: that's it.

speaker1: holy like a fort. 
speaker2: the kiowa... they were taken too.
speaker3: transports. way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship.
speaker1: place is crawling with those things. we'll never even get close.
speaker4: he says there's a back way in... the twin rivers run underneath this whole canyon. limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple miles east. lead right down there. jake looks to the sky. dark. determined.
speaker5: the slaver... he's up in that big cloud?

speaker1: just so i got this straight... three of those things just kicked the out of your entire gang, took our whole town, and now you two're gonna ride right into that fort, try to hijack one'a those-- he pauses on the word -- 
speaker2: "transports."
speaker1: -- ride it up to that space boat --
speaker2: spaceshp.
speaker1: then bring it down here and get everybody off alive? that's your big plan? jake and ella share a look. simply:
speaker3: yup.
speaker1: and just how do you figure on getting in there in the first place?
speaker3: poke a hornet's nest... they swarm at'cha.
speaker2: you gotta draw 'em out. buy us a distraction.
speaker1: you want us to storm that fort? against those things? with less than fifty men?
speaker4: it ain't, it's been done! i read at school how ethan allen and his green mountain boys took fort ticonderoga, they weren't but a small garrison and they were outgunned --
speaker2: we need all of you to make a stand.

speaker1: make a stand with what? 
speaker2: this.
speaker3: hell, yeah. let's squish some bugs.
speaker2: somethin' funny?
speaker1: yeah... that you whites finally know what it feels like to face extinction. now that we're on the same side, he says we can all die together.
speaker1: they're with us.
speaker2: guess that means you're not waitin' for your dad to come back.
speaker1: been woodrow dolarhyde's son my whole life... first time he ever copped to it was to save his own ass. he's not comin' back.

speaker1: not you, kid. 
speaker2: aw, hell, we been through this. ya can't stop me.
speaker1: i can shoot you in the foot.
speaker2: bu111i11shit.
speaker1: you told me your daddy's all you got left. want me to save his ass? then park yours right there on the ground, you little got me?
speaker2: yeah. i gotcha.
speaker3: stay with the kid, happy.
speaker1: i'll get your father back. still owes me fifty dollars.
speaker1: you'll be ready?

speaker1: that's a nice thing... what you said to the boy. i didn't know better, i'd say you got yourself a sweet side. 
speaker2: there's nothin' sweet about me. i told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldn't get in my way. all i care about is killin' that thing.
speaker1: i don't believe that.
speaker2: well believe it. i was playing a part. just like you were.

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: need it to save nat.
speaker3: and now her worry becomes fear; english now:

speaker2: who's got your boy?
speaker3: well, there's the rub.
speaker3: i got two.

speaker1: c g_that shuttle. 
speaker2: knew there was a good reason i didn't kill you.
speaker1: just thinkin' the same thing.

speaker1: strap in. dammit!!! 
speaker2: into what?!?

speaker1: hold on. 
speaker2: she cranks back and the ship pitches upward --

speaker1: -- dammit --- -- what--? 
speaker2: engines are warming up -- got eight minutes til the ship leaves, and about one til automated retrieval --
speaker3: -- autojamated what --?

speaker1: hug the wall. 
speaker1: when they come at us, aim for their heads. only way to kill 'em for sure.
speaker2: i'll aim just fine.

speaker1: we can't let that thing see us or they'll know we're here. 
speaker1: this'll take us to the bridge -- but jake doesn't follow. stares at her --
speaker2: slaver's up there--?
speaker1: i sure as hope not.
speaker2: then i'm not goin' with you.
speaker1: you got any idea how big this ship is? no ray you'll ever find him alone. be like findin' a needle in a--

speaker2: we're losing ranks ! ! !
speaker3: you came back!
speaker4: told you: i take care of my kin.

speaker1: drop the woman. we both know this ain't about her. 
speaker1: she says you're as bad as they come.
speaker1: well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say the same about me.
speaker1: could'a had your boys kill me five times over, instead you rolled out the red carpet... so let's get it over with.

speaker1: -- you alright? 
speaker2: reactor's hit. if i don't get this ship on the ground soon, we're all dead... get me over to that turbolift.

speaker1: put me inside. 
speaker1: i can manage the rest without you.
speaker2: go do what you came up here to do.
speaker3: goddamnit.
speaker3: stop smiling.

speaker1: the iz that? 
speaker2: tell him to hold still! if i have this thing figured right, long as t keep my finger under the red pin we won't blow up!
speaker3: what's he saying?:

speaker1: he says we're all gonna die. 
speaker2: we need to pull it out of his shoulder!
speaker1: i'm not pullin' anything!
speaker1: he's the doctor!

speaker1: on three... 
speaker1: one... t --
speaker2: -- wait. everyone lurches from the tension interrupt:
speaker2: tell your wife we're clear.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: -- your wife. maria. we had an arrangement. i left your saloon alone and she paid me off.
speaker1: we're broke. paid you off with what?

speaker1: she stole from the people in your morgue. gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches -- 
speaker2: i thought she was cheating!
speaker1: just robbin' corpses.
speaker2: thank wait. you hate me. why're you telling me this?
speaker1: may not get another chance --
speaker1: -- and i still hate ya.

speaker1: we're going down fast. 
speaker2: no matter what.

speaker1: i lied. 
speaker2: ... i know.
speaker1: no, i heard what you said when i was layin' there...
speaker3: jake. taken aback. laid bare. as she says:
speaker1: you are a good man. at least... to me.

speaker1: nat? 
speaker2: what... happened?
speaker3: he's dead.
speaker2: who's gettin' the ranch?

speaker1: no one's gettin' my ranch. 
speaker2: paw, he-- dolarhyde smacks percy across the face:
speaker2: ow!!! what'd you do that for?
speaker3: for being an ungrateful little bastard. now shake your brother's hand and thank him for saving your ass, cause it's more than you ever would'a done bjm.

speaker1: . what is it? 
speaker2: we didn't get all of 'em. some ran oft.

speaker1: -- what? what'd i dq? 
speaker2: get outta the road before you're run down! if your momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the street she'd roll over in her grave and shoot lightnin' bolts outta her eyes," i know, i know!
speaker3: kid's got a mouth on him.

speaker1: well, kyle, considering he saved your life, guess you'll just have to grin'n bear it. 
speaker2: woodrow.
speaker3: kyle.
speaker3: go_ _on.
speaker2: what's this?
speaker3: claims to the land 50 miles west of here. i've signed it over to the township of absolution. considering i'm a businessman, i figure expansion's in both our interests. needs the sheriff's signature to be official.
speaker2: fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is, woodrow.
speaker3: that so.
speaker2: what's this about twenty percent going to the apaches?
speaker3: figure the only way not to 'em off is to buy 'em.
speaker2: since when'd you worry about pissin' anyone off?

speaker1: just sign it, goddamnit. 
speaker2: i'd say you were being generous, woodrow, but i know you'd just be insulted.
speaker1: right.

speaker1: shh! the workers will hear us!!! let them hear! 
speaker2: what is this?
speaker3: look at the inscription.
speaker2: this looks like aldo mayberry's watch...
speaker3: shut up and kiss me.

speaker1: second time that dog ran off on me. 
speaker2: second time he brought me to you.
speaker2: looks like you got everything set.

speaker1: where you headed? 
speaker2: got some messes to clean up.
speaker1: messes.
speaker2: ... yep. what.
speaker1: i think you're ridin' off cause you're just scared of what'll happen if you stay.
speaker2: and what's gonna happen?
speaker3: she steps closer to him... intimate:
speaker1: you know.
speaker2: if i stay... it's not gonna be good for anybody, ella.
speaker1: heard some rumors outta abilene. weird noises at night. cattle mutilations. weather phenomena. figured i'd ride down there. give it a look-see.
speaker2: what's 'phenomena'?
speaker1: big storms in places that don't get big storms.
speaker2: you goin' down there yourself?
speaker1: why? you worried about me?
speaker2: no, ma'am. you can take care of yourself just fine. be seein' you around.
speaker1: goodbye, jake.

speaker1: get the away from me, you mutt. 
speaker1: go on, get.
speaker1: abilene happens to be on my way.
speaker1: stop smiling, goddammit.
