EMMETT: you sure he's a bad guy, pa? he did give percy a lickin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART: he's bad enough.
EMMETT: . can i come with you?
SHERIFF TAGGART: too dangerous.

EMMETT: dangerous to drive a coach? why can't charlie just take him? 
SHERIFF TAGGART: because it's my job, emmett. that's what these people pay me to do. and your mother would kill me if i brought you. emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --
EMMETT: good thing she's already dead then.

EMMETT: is it... dead? 
DOLARHYDE: . the j,,a it?
MEACHAM: a demon.
MEACHAM: revelations 16:14: "for there are spirits of demons, showing signs." escaped from itself.
EMMETT: lookit its wrist! it's got one'a those bracelet things too!
NAT COLORADO: i think... it's comin' from somewhere inside it.
DOLARHYDE: only one way to find out. we need to cut it open.
DOLARHYDE: you're a doctor. got a bone saw?
DOC: . are you... serious?

DOLARHYDE: well this one here's our only chance of findin' where they went. 
DOLLARHYDE: so you got a bone saw or don't you?

DOC: stay outside. you're not welcome in here! 
DOLARRYDE: i own more of this town than any man in it so i'll go wherever the i please. and for the record? you ain't welcome in my country, mexican.
ELLA: whatever troubles you had don't mean a thing against the ones we got now. we wanna see our way through 'em, your guns better start pointing in the same direction, goddammit.
DOC: if it 'mss a demon, and i cut it open... am i going to burn for it?

MEACHAM: that should cover ya.

DOC: gimme my scalpel. 
DOLARHYDE: where'd it go? the hell'd you do?
DOC: nothing, just pulled it off --

DOC: only works when it's touching the creature. 
NAT COLORADO: i think... it's a compass. look: no matter how you move it, it points in the same direction.
EMMETT: compasses point north. that's west.
MEACHAM: west's where 141 came from.
EMMETT: if you're right, what's it pointing to?
ELLA: the rest of 'em.
ELLA: be my guess.
DOLARHYDE: then that's where i'm goin'.
DOLARHYDE: one of my ranchers said my herd disappeared into the sky. 'til about ten minutes ago, i figured him for a liar. nobody takes my cattle.
MEACHAM: your b was taken too.
DOLARHYDE: i noticed.
NAT COLORADO: what if they're already dead?
EMMETT: they're not dead.

ELLA: kid's right. if all they wanted was to kill us, they would've. 
DOLARHYDE: looked to me like... they were ropin' people.
DOLARHYDE: means they need 'em for something. whatever it is, we can either stand here guessin'... or go find out.
DOC: if she's alive -- if there's even a

MEACHAM: lord hates a coward... but our bullets were useless against those things. other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and outnumbered. 
JAKE: whoa, i got nothing to do with this --
ELLA: you got everything to do with it. if you can remember where you got that thing --
JAKE: i remember you all wantin' me on the end of a rope. whatever's happenin' here's got nothin' to do with me.
ELLA: you sure. about that?
EMMETT: mr. lonergan? sir?

ELLA: if you're walkin' away from here, what the hell're you walking tsq?
JAKE: what the are you walkin' to, lady? 'cause if i heard right, it sounds like suicide to me.

ELLA: i... just wanna help these people. 
JAKE: you wanna help yourself. saw your face light up the minute you knew that thing might lead you to gold.
ELLA: it's not gold i want, you it's what it'll buy me.

MEACHAM: thy will be done, lord, and there's an amen behind it.
DOLARHYDE: somebody got something to say?
MEACHAM: sure we need to bring that thing along?
DOC: if this arrow points me back to maria? yeah -- j'm sure.
MEACHAM: can't come, emmett, too dangerous.
EMMETT: i can protect myself -- shoot, i'm the only master bowman in my archery club. won the county tournament by shootin' a flipped nickel at 50 paces.
MEACHAM: somethin' tells me these things don't carry nickels, son. answers's no.

EMMETT: you want me to ride off with the chickenshits, then double back, be happy to. but let's just skip that part and get to it, padre.

MEACHAM: you know i can't say.

ELLA: . she's pretty. who was she?

ELLA: trust me, lonergan. i'm not the same.
JAKE: don't matter.
ELLA: so what dj= matter?
JAKE: what matters is i find the thing that killed her. and make it pay.

JAKE: -- and don't lie to me. you wouldn't've asked me if you didn't recognize it.
JAKE: those things... they the ones who put those marks on your back?

ELLA: they took my people. destroyed where i'm from. 
JAKE: where's that?
ELLA: north of here. been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town. best i figure, they're hidin' in a mine.
JAKE: maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me --
ELLA: -- what, you would've stuck around? i couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than i could've stopped these people from going after their kin.
ELLA: truth ain't worth a damn, jake... and we're gonna need all the guns we can get.
JAKE: so that's the only reason you wanted me to come with you? cause of my gun?

JAKE: i-- i did love her.
JAKE: she was like you. seemed to think i was a good man.
CRACKS): but i couldn't save either of you.
JAKE: where's the good in that?
JAKE: i'm sorry, ella.

EMMETT: wasn't your fault, mr. lonergan. those things... were lookin' for her. had a picture and everything. 
JAKE: what d'you mean... 'a picture'?
EMMETT: floatin', like that arrow thing we found in its eye.
DOC: what'd he say?
COLORADO: "kill them. and make it quick."
DOC: now'd be a good time to use your gun bracelet, my friend.

GREY WOLF: how is it that you speak our language? 
UOLARHYUE: because i'm a genius.

GREY WOLF: forget about quick. make him feel it. 
DOLARHYDE: two hundred head of cattle!

GREY WOLF: and how do i know you'll come back? 
DOLARHYDE: you can keep my associate here. if i don ' t come back, you can kill him.
GREY WOLF: why should i believe that you even care about this man?
DOLARHYDE: because he's my son.
GREY WOLF: is this true?
COLORADO: yeah... he's my father.
GREY WOLF: three hundred head.

DOLARHYDE: two fifty. 
GREY WOLF: cut him loose.
EMMETT: hey! what about =?!?
DOLARHYDE: what about you, kid?
GREY WOLF: kill all of them except the half-breed.
JAKE: what're you waiting for, asshole? do it. and as jake's about to meet his death:

ELLA: . what... happened? 
EMMETT: you... died.

ELLA: if i'd told you on the boat, you never would'a trusted me -- 
JAKE: did you hear what i said?
ELLA: .. what?
JAKE: when you were playin' possum. did you hear what i mid?
ELLA: no. i was mendin'.
ELLA: it's like sleep.
JAKE: how's it you look like one of us?
ELLA: i can look like whatever i want to.
JAKE: so you can't die?

ELLA: sure i can. if my heart stops beating... just like you. 
.JAKE: you're nothin' like me, ella. you're one'a them.
ELLA: i'm not, jake. i'm from a different place.
JAKE: the one that took you.
JAKE: it killed her.
ELLA: they call him the slaver. he's the one, gave me the scars. broke me. and made me watch... while he killed my family too.

ELLA: our race was first to map the stars... that's why they came for us. took our planet, piece by piece. slaughtered anyone who fought hack. ones who survived were turned into slaves. trackers. 
ELLA: they brought me aboard one of their scout ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to find other planets like mine. planets they can take... people they can enslave.
JAKE: x lead 'em here.
EMMETT: well damn, lady, thanks a 1.
ELLA: i never wanted this. but they got... ways. of making you do things.
ELLA: been tryin' to make it right... tried to blow the ship to by burnin' up all their fuel, then escaped down here.
ELLA: 'cept it didn't work... thing survived.
JAKE: where is it.
ELLA: hiding in that cloud. way i figure, they'll find enough fuel to leave by tomorrow, midday. then they'll bring back the others.

DOC: "others"? 
ELLA: the whole fleet. they'll take what they need. everyone on this planet. anything too weak to survive... they'll toss. like that cow.
NAT COLORADO: what'd you mean, they're looking for "fuel"...?
JAKE: gold. that's why they're in a mine.
ELLA: . wherever it is, that's where you escaped from -- and it's the only way back up to the ship.
ELLA: even with your memory wiped, your instincts kicked in --
ELLA: that's how it works, jake, the bracelet reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it reacts. somehow you took it off one of 'em... don't you remember any of it?
JAKE: i-- i blasted my way out...

JAKE: i remember seeing a tower... made of stone... on the rim of a canyon... 
ELLA: what? what's he sayin'?!?
COLORADO: that rock you're talkin' about... he- knows where it is.

SHERIFF TAGGART: you... all right...? 
MARIA: . fantastic. you?

NAT COLORADO: this is kiowa land, their sister tribe. 
JAKE: that's it.

DOC: holy like a fort. 
GREY WOLF: the kiowa... they were taken too.
ELLA: transports. way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship.
DOC: place is crawling with those things. we'll never even get close.
NAT COLORADO: he says there's a back way in... the twin rivers run underneath this whole canyon. limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple miles east. lead right down there. jake looks to the sky. dark. determined.
JAKE: the slaver... he's up in that big cloud?

DOC: just so i got this straight... three of those things just kicked the out of your entire gang, took our whole town, and now you two're gonna ride right into that fort, try to hijack one'a those-- he pauses on the word -- 
ELLA: "transports."
DOC: -- ride it up to that space boat --
ELLA: spaceshp.
DOC: then bring it down here and get everybody off alive? that's your big plan? jake and ella share a look. simply:
JAKE: yup.
DOC: and just how do you figure on getting in there in the first place?
JAKE: poke a hornet's nest... they swarm at'cha.
ELLA: you gotta draw 'em out. buy us a distraction.
DOC: you want us to storm that fort? against those things? with less than fifty men?
EMMETT: it ain't, it's been done! i read at school how ethan allen and his green mountain boys took fort ticonderoga, they weren't but a small garrison and they were outgunned --
ELLA: we need all of you to make a stand.

NAT COLORADO: make a stand with what? 
JAKE: this.
EMMETT: hell, yeah. let's squish some bugs.
JAKE: somethin' funny?
NAT COLORADO: yeah... that you whites finally know what it feels like to face extinction. now that we're on the same side, he says we can all die together.
NAT COLORADO: they're with us.
JAKE: guess that means you're not waitin' for your dad to come back.
NAT COLORADO: been woodrow dolarhyde's son my whole life... first time he ever copped to it was to save his own ass. he's not comin' back.

JAKE: not you, kid. 
EMMETT: aw, hell, we been through this. ya can't stop me.
JAKE: i can shoot you in the foot.
EMMETT: bu111i11shit.
JAKE: you told me your daddy's all you got left. want me to save his ass? then park yours right there on the ground, you little got me?
EMMETT: yeah. i gotcha.
ELLA: stay with the kid, happy.
JAKE: i'll get your father back. still owes me fifty dollars.
JAKE: you'll be ready?

ELLA: that's a nice thing... what you said to the boy. i didn't know better, i'd say you got yourself a sweet side. 
JAKE: there's nothin' sweet about me. i told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldn't get in my way. all i care about is killin' that thing.
ELLA: i don't believe that.
JAKE: well believe it. i was playing a part. just like you were.

BRONC: who's got your boy?
DOLARHYDE: well, there's the rub.
DOLARHYDE: i got two.

NAT COLORADO: c g_that shuttle. 
JAKE: knew there was a good reason i didn't kill you.
NAT COLORADO: just thinkin' the same thing.

ELLA: strap in. dammit!!! 
JAKE: into what?!?

ELLA: hold on. 
90.: she cranks back and the ship pitches upward --

ELLA JAKE: -- dammit --- -- what--? 
ELLA: engines are warming up -- got eight minutes til the ship leaves, and about one til automated retrieval --
JAKE: -- autojamated what --?

ELLA: hug the wall. 
ELLA: when they come at us, aim for their heads. only way to kill 'em for sure.
JAKE: i'll aim just fine.

ELLA: we can't let that thing see us or they'll know we're here. 
ELLA: this'll take us to the bridge -- but jake doesn't follow. stares at her --
JAKE: slaver's up there--?
ELLA: i sure as hope not.
JAKE: then i'm not goin' with you.
ELLA: you got any idea how big this ship is? no ray you'll ever find him alone. be like findin' a needle in a--

JAKE: drop the woman. we both know this ain't about her. 
JAKE: she says you're as bad as they come.
JAKE: well, you ugly sonofabitch... they say the same about me.
JAKE: could'a had your boys kill me five times over, instead you rolled out the red carpet... so let's get it over with.

JAKE: -- you alright? 
ELLA: reactor's hit. if i don't get this ship on the ground soon, we're all dead... get me over to that turbolift.

ELLA: put me inside. 
ELLA: i can manage the rest without you.
COMPASSION): go do what you came up here to do.
JAKE: goddamnit.
JAKE: stop smiling.

DOL.ARHYDE: the iz that? 
DOC: tell him to hold still! if i have this thing figured right, long as t keep my finger under the red pin we won't blow up!
GREY WOLF: what's he saying?:

DOLARHYDE: he says we're all gonna die. 
COLORADO: we need to pull it out of his shoulder!
DOLARHYDE: i'm not pullin' anything!
DOLARHYDE: he's the doctor!

NAT COLORADO: he's dead.
PERCY: who's gettin' the ranch?

DOLARHYDE: no one's gettin' my ranch. 
PERCY: paw, he-- dolarhyde smacks percy across the face:
PERCY: ow!!! what'd you do that for?
UOLARHYUE: for being an ungrateful little bastard. now shake your brother's hand and thank him for saving your ass, cause it's more than you ever would'a done bjm.

JAKE: . what is it? 
ELLA: we didn't get all of 'em. some ran oft.

EMMETT: -- what? what'd i dq? 
SHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT: get outta the road before you're run down! if your momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the street she'd roll over in her grave and shoot lightnin' bolts outta her eyes," i know, i know!
SHERIFF TAGGART: kid's got a mouth on him.

DEPUTY WADE: well, kyle, considering he saved your life, guess you'll just have to grin'n bear it. 
SHERIFF TAGGART: woodrow.
DOLARHYDE: kyle.
DOLARHYDE: go_ _on.
SHERIFF TAGGART: what's this?
DOLARHYDE: claims to the land 50 miles west of here. i've signed it over to the township of absolution. considering i'm a businessman, i figure expansion's in both our interests. needs the sheriff's signature to be official.
SHERIFF TAGGART: fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is, woodrow.
DOLARHYDE: that so.
SHERIFF TAGGART: what's this about twenty percent going to the apaches?
DOLARHYDE: figure the only way not to 'em off is to buy 'em.
SHERIFF TAGGART: since when'd you worry about pissin' anyone off?

DOLARHYDE: just sign it, goddamnit. 
SHERIFF TAGGART: i'd say you were being generous, woodrow, but i know you'd just be insulted.
DOLARHYDE: right.

DOC MARIA: shh! the workers will hear us!!! let them hear! 
DOC: what is this?
MARIA: look at the inscription.

JAKE: looks like you got everything set.

ELLA: where you headed? 
JAKE: got some messes to clean up.
ELLA: messes.

ELLA: you know.
JAKE: if i stay... it's not gonna be good for anybody, ella.
ELLA: heard some rumors outta abilene. weird noises at night. cattle mutilations. weather phenomena. figured i'd ride down there. give it a look-see.
