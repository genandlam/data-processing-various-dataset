CRUZ: baker. you got it solved? 
GIN: i was with someone, all right?
CRUZ: so? this is work.
GIN: hector, i hardly know the guy. why be impolite to strangers?
CRUZ: look at those assholes...
CRUZ: if the vermeer were lying on that table, they'd toss their doughnuts on it.
GIN: yeh, well, they didn't insure it, so they don't
GIN: he came in through the window.
CRUZ: that's not possib...
GIN: what's not possible is entry through the doors or the vents. that would have triggered instant alarm.
CRUZ: the windows are wired, too.
GIN: only for trauma. they used smart glass, where the sensors respond to violation of the panel's integrity.
GIN: i think he scaled the wall, popped the frame. in one piece.
GIN: then, he only had to deal with heat and motion sensors. they were on 60-second delay, so the owner wouldn't trigger the alarm just be walking arou...
CRUZ: the pane weighs 200 pounds, the building's 1100 feet high.
GIN: this particular guy is the best. the best there ever was.
CRUZ: popping the frame would trigger the alarm.
GIN: here's how i figured it out...
GIN: no one arranges flowers like that. it was the draft from the window.
CRUZ: you said. this particular guy.
GIN: andrew macdougal.
CRUZ: why not houdini? or pretty boy floyd? maybe christ.
GIN: because they couldn't do it.
CRUZ: he's been out of the business.
GIN: don't be a putz. this is his
CRUZ: oh, i get it. he has no interest in vermeers, so that proves he stole one. by that logic, he oughta be a suspect most of the time.
GIN: you love to embarrass yourself.
GIN: the auction. where our client
GIN: staking it out. why bid, when you can mark the buyer, and jack it within the month?
GIN: at this moment, he is winging on jal flight 307 to narita,
GIN: bet your ass. at vegas odds.
GIN: research reveals three known fences, still at large, who are believed to have brokered vermeers to black market buyers. sandrine palmer is hospitalized in malta with ovarian cancer.

GIN: the other two. live in tokyo. 
CRUZ: and you did all this since 4:30 this morning.

GIN: uh. i'm showing off. 
MAC: something of a habit?
MAC: you know the alleged value of this piece from some

MAC: virginia romay... 
GIN: gin, actually, gin romay. i was named after a card game.
MAC: or a cheap cocktail. she blinks. his brows raise... mac as in. i'll have a gin romay, please. with a twist.
GIN: you're supposed to be charming.
MAC: i'm supposed to be selective.
MAC: art and antiquities acquisition advisor, how alliterative...
MAC: and am i the antiquity?
GIN: in mint condition.
GIN: look, i've studied you, i know... pretty much...everything.
GIN: made your first millions selling scrap metal. then, gold mining concessions, gems, art, and lately strategic metals for new technologies - platinum, zirconium, titanium...
MAC: you said. everything.
GIN: the cat burglar stories? why would anyone...with so much to lose...take those kinds of risks?
GIN: you'd have to be. stupid.
MAC: excuse me.
GIN: i didn't know porsche made things like this.
MAC: well, they don't...
MAC: ...as a rule.
GIN: recognize that?
GIN: my seller is in shinjuku, we can go there tonight.
GIN: he wants 4.6 million. i can get it for three.
MAC: no, you can't.

MAC: ...only it's not 
MAC: my favorite thing in life. coincidence.
GIN: i'm staying here, what's your excuse?
MAC: staying here, as well. you are in room...? gin one thirty-eight.
MAC: will you send a half-bottle of chateau d'yquem '67 to room 138, please? and some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with.
MAC: actually, i was just across the room, dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting spitzweg. until i determined the painting was apparently stolen...
MAC: goes against my grain. the dekooning in your slide, the 4.6 million you can get for 3. can you get it for 2 and a half?
GIN: sure.
MAC: my checkbook is in my safe. you wait here.
GIN: okay. i'll wait here.

GIN: that's my purse. 
MAC: just want to see if i'm with the person you say you are. can't be too caref...
NOISE.: mac oh, dear.
GIN: are you all right?
MAC: these are my papers, passport, car registration. if the police arri...
GIN: you're going to need stitches, let me get you to a hospital.
GIN: really, this can all wait. i'll handle it.
MAC: that's actually. very sweet.

GIN: mr. macdougal? sir? 
GIN: uh. mr. ma... mac just 'mac'. and whatever became of a gentleman's privacy?
MAC: my more females?
GIN: i was worried, it's been twenty...
MAC: eighteen, actually. the leg is fine, but i got sort of...woozy.
GIN: woozy.
MAC: lost my stomach once or twice.
MAC: i'm an old man. you probably noticed.
MAC: you should see me without my teeth.
MAC: ah. mustn't forget to zip up.
MAC: odd place, this.
MAC: what do you suppose they make here? video recorders?
GIN: microchips, i think, for computers.
MAC: bad investment. the best ones are here today...
MAC: gone tomor...

GIN: this isn't the way to my sel... mac i've changed my mind. 
GIN: mind telling me why?
MAC: you can't get it for me at 2.5, can you?
GIN: well, we can tr...
MAC: you were setting me up. the correct price is 2.8. you conspire with the seller to start at 4.6, so i'll be grateful when you 'bargain' him down to three. close enough to fool some people. unfortunately...
MAC: i'm old. i know what everything is worth.
GIN: so where are we g...
MAC: i am going to the airport. you are going on to the rest of your life. which...
MAC: ...should be interesting.
GIN: you forgot your lugg...
MAC: the hotels deal with that. the things i need are always waiting at the next one. i don't carry. baggage.
GIN: sensible. and you're off to...?
MAC: oh, that's highly personal.
GIN: i did so hope to impress you.
MAC: young lady. i am old enough to be your grandfather. she shakes her head. uh-uh. gin my father. leans her mouth in for the kill. gin that's part of the rush.

GIN: here. a reward. 
MAC: a reward for what?
GIN: for not being old. after all.
MAC: you mean. not as old as i look. she traces her finger along his cheek. gin yeh.
GIN: do i deserve a reward?
GIN: it's so hard to find good casual sex, anymore. i'm probably out of practice.
MAC: what's hard to find. is someone you truly want to be with.
MAC: even for awhile.
GIN: it's lucky we stopped by my room, for the wine.
GIN: otherwise, we'd never have found my bag was stolen. until tomorrow.
MAC: would that make it more stolen?
GIN: they even got my prescriptions.
MAC: something you need? there are all-night chemists...
GIN: i take prilosec. for stomach acid. and an inhaler. for asthma.
GIN: but since i didn't have to work all that hard tonight...
GIN: why would someone steal
GIN: such as...
MAC: well. wannabe dealers make excellent fences.
GIN: he thought i had a stolen painting. in my bag.
MAC: i'm joking, of course.
MAC: the vermeer wouldn't fit.
GIN: excuse me?
MAC: why, did you do something wrong?
GIN: you said. vermeer.
MAC: the most famous painting stolen this week.
MAC: if you don't keep up on your craft. you'll miss all the jokes.

MAC: i'm so glad i didn't leave tokyo. 
GIN: i love a guy who knows how to sweet talk.
MAC: there was a call. while you were sleeping.
MAC: an art dealer i know. he has a monet. minor, but it
GIN: me.
MAC: if i'm there, he'll haggle. you just hand him the debit card, with that...luminous smile. and say, take it or leave it.
MAC: oh, dear. i thought you so wanted to make a good impression.
GIN: thought i already did th...
MAC: and along with making an
MAC: any problems. just give me a ring.
GIN: stolen painting is it?
MAC: of course not.
MAC: if it was. i wouldn't pay more than three.

OKATI: you doin' it. 
GIN: i think there's some mista...
OKATI: you from mac?
GIN: i'm from mac.
OKATI: lemme see card.
OKATI: four million, six hundred thirteen thousand, five hundred?
GIN: you first.
OKATI: this as real as it gets, lady.
MAC: you got it? gin is this an audition, a joke, or a rip-off? i'm staring at an obvious forgery, here.
MAC: turn it over.
MAC: is there an envelope? taped to the back? in a ziploc bag? sure is. gin uh-huh.
MAC: detach the bag. read what's in it. aloud.
MAC: papers
MAC: while he's checking, look around the room casually, as if searching for the cheesy handbags...
MAC: all the while laughing, as if you are chatting with someone you actually
MAC: call out cheerily to okati, in english, 'where's the toilet?' gin can i say, 'little girl's room'?
MAC: wing it.

MAC: get going. now. gin mac, the painting isn't... 
MAC: you've got what we bought, are you out of their sight?

MAC: jump. 
MAC: the

MAC: dry clothes, you'll need them. in five minutes.
GIN: i'm supposed to change?

MAC: you probably won't be dating any of them, so what the hell.
MAC: found 'em in your room. perhaps the thief wasn't your size.
MAC: we have a business appointment. in four minutes.
GIN: business, huh?
GIN: uh. am i gonna like th... mac i'm a thief.

GIN: and if i refuse? mac don't. please.
GIN: i mean, you won't
GIN: what could you possibly steal in 18 min...
MAC: thirty-five
MAC: i stole your suitcase when i left you at the bar. i have since sent it on to the states, with
MAC: they receive. an anonymous. tip.
GIN: that's entrapment.
MAC: no, entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
MAC: blackmail. is what robbers do to schmucks. and leans. to kiss her mouth. mac even adorable ones.
MAC: pop quiz.
MAC: admit it's a rush. the best day of your heretofore drab life.
GIN: you.
GIN: ...accompanied by related foreplay. and gives him the smile. what a gal.

MAN: nickerson carlsby, mr... 
MAC: banquo macduff. this is my associate-fiancee, ms. duncan.
CARLSBY: that is...fiancee
MAC: i'm a scot. it's a different country. culturally and historically. i see. carlsby well. they've brought you to quite the wrong place, i see. mac thank
CARLSBY: five feet thick with hidden rein- forcements, no way to drill through! gin impressive.
CARLSBY: only the tip of our security iceberg. see these two brinks locks...?
CARLSBY: the captain keeps one key. the other is continually forwarded: to the chief of security at next port. there is no way to enter during voyage.
GIN: i like this.
CARLSBY: the best armed guard, rotated every six hours. a redundancy, of course, but we would rather be safe three times over than merely two.
GIN: sound mathematics. mac what if there's a fire? in the chamber.
CARLSBY: sprinklers. new design. incredible power. the entire chamber is water- proof, fireproof, airtight. if the ship
MAC: wine.
MAC: the japs bought up half the premium clarets in the universe. you may have heard.
MAC: i'm in charge of shipping some 14,000 bottles, most quite rare, to a number of premium hotels in hong kong, bangkok, singapore, phuket, and penang.
MAC: all of which are destinations on your october voyage. five months from now. however...
MAC: wine. doesn't prefer. to be jostled.
CARLSBY: our 'delicate treasure' platforms, suspended on gimbals. your cargo remains unruffled by roiling seas. then, on arrival, is plucked...
CARLSBY: by that forklift, and gently deposited on dock through the cargo hatch...
MAC: adequate. i suppose.
MAC: did we see...a bathing pool.
CARLSBY: oh, yes, sir. the shikoku maru carries sixteen luxury suite pas- senger cabins. the finest cuisine. for valued clients who prefer to cruise in privacy.
MAC: mildly. interesting.

MAC: adequate. i suppose. 
GIN: but dearest, in five months, we'll be in cape town.
MAC: anything sooner? that goes perhaps from...say, sri lanka? to jakarta.
CARLSBY: why, yes. in three weeks.

MAC: you seem depressed. 
GIN: at your insistence, i'm leaping to my death, and i don't know
GIN: i'm not jumping until you
MAC: what
GIN: what does it do, make gold?
MAC: we're nearing the targ...
GIN: why won't you trust me?
MAC: how do i know who you are, hmmn?
MAC: for all i know, your name isn't virginia romay. maybe you're a cop.
GIN: why would a cop do all th... mac entrapment, remember? what cops do to robbers. gin oh. that.
MAC: one...two...
GIN: mac, i'm afraid.
GIN: of you. mac smart girl.

MAC: all right, six and seven... 
MAC: three and four...

GIN: what the are we building? 
MAC: a chalet, i think. or an outhouse.

MAC: forty seconds. 
GIN: get your

MAC: this time, when you raise your arm. don't breathe. 
MAC: very, very nice. had a tour with the mosad, did you?
GIN: where does this fit in the game plan?
MAC: oh, it doesn't. but one never knows...
MAC: you might need it with me.

GIN: this one, i will 
MAC: quite remarkable.
MAC: take the rest of the evening off.

VOICE: webber assurance. 
GIN: this is oh-four-six-one. hector cruz, please, on a secure line.
VOICE: please hold.
VOICE: go ahead, please.
GIN: thank y... the line goes dead.
GIN: ...no way i'm telling you
CRUZ: baker, this is an extremely
GIN: if i tell you
GIN: right to the wall.
CRUZ: you're over your head, baker.
GIN: only romantically. i'll write to him in prison.
CRUZ: okay, it's your funeral. next time i see you, i owe you a spanking.
GIN: ooooo. is that a promise?
CRUZ: while you're on secure, do you want a transfer?
GIN: nope. i'm headed back to the hot tub. i'll call again, if i'm in the mood.

GIN: i'm freezing my tender parts. 
MAC: i'm relieved to hear you have some.
MAC: what's amazing, is that only eleven workers died during construction of this thing... gin ...thanks for sharing...
MAC: of course, the others were saved by a safety net.
GIN: one act of human kindness...
MAC: call it a lapse.
GIN: and how does
MAC: to ginger baker.
GIN: i'm partial to drummers. if they played with clapton and winwood.
GIN: the prescription bottle. when you stole my suitcase.
GIN: armand baker was my husband, may 13 to october 27, 1982, he played alto sax, i was 17 years old.
GIN: he named me ginger. he likes drummers, too.
MAC: and you get sentimental for him.
GIN: i have i.d. in that name. i use it for various things i don't want traced. when credit unions turn their computers my way.
MAC: i could listen to you lie all night. she toasts him. gin same here, fella.
MAC: do you like diamonds?
MAC: you asked. does the machine. make gold.
MAC: gold is it's six thousand dollars a pound. worth your weight in gold...?
MAC: that would put you at seven hundred thousand.
GIN: would you pay it?
MAC: when the light hits you just right. i'd pay more.
GIN: the machine. that we are stealing. makes diamonds?
GIN: real ones?
MAC: gem quality. first ever. save japan.
MAC: a diamond reactor takes graphite, runs it through a combination of lasers, electron beams, and scanning- tunnel mg microscopes.
MAC: this one uses krypton-fluorine laser, with a new isotope of krypton.
MAC: the atoms are rearranged. and the molecule of graphite becoznes a molecule of...
GIN: i hate it. when you make a point.

STEWARD: all right, then. all set. 
STEWARD: we will keep your passports in our safe until jakarta.
MAC: of course.
STEWARD: you are suite 16...
GIN: ...and never been kissed.
MAC: we had booked suite 9.
STEWARD: 16 is our tokugawa suite, far superior, trust me.
STEWARD: you luggage is

MAC: down there. ten o'clock. 
GIN: are you dumping fuel?
MAC: changed my mind. there's nothing on the instruments downrange. the longer she flies before she ditches, the less chance they notice on the bridge.
MAC: you should lose the oxygen tank at 8000 feet.
GIN: and how do i judge that? babe's intuition?
GIN: so i just ask you on the way down? or were you planning to e-mail me.
MAC: i hate a crybaby.

MAC: it's over, it's over... 
MAC: catch your breath, quickly. hang on for the wake.

MAC: if i were you, i'd watch the desserts. 
GIN: boy, i'll bet you were in shape before you got old.
MAC: too long ago to remember.
GIN: i can take it from here, thanks.
GIN: if you'd packed my primary chute right, i wouldn't ha...
MAC: yes, you would. you're a girl.
MAC: anytime you're ready.
MAC: better angle.
MAC: you might want to move aside...
MAC: may i trouble you for the torch? or would you rather just dance.
GIN: i know i packed it.
MAC: coal into diamonds. a wealth machine.
GIN: how do you know that's it? mac it's 12 by 9 by 7 feet. and it's the only thing worth waterproofing, in case the ship sinks. gin ...you twit.
MAC: hmmn?
GIN: i'm just finishing your sentence. can't you answer a question with- out making me feel stupid?
MAC: why would i bother?
MAC: let's get one thing straight. i don't work with partners much, because basically, i find most people to be idiots.
MAC: you, in contrast, are first-rate.
MAC: and if
MAC: precise coordinates. you could find a golf ball in the gobi desert.
GIN: where you g... mac fork lift.
GIN: that's
GIN: won't they hear it?
MAC: over these engines? through five feet of steel?
MAC: hell, if they do, they don't have the second key to get in.
MAC: thank for redundant security.
GIN: you gotta work on that impatient streak. ...and slips them straight in. first try. gin how professional.
GIN: uh. thing on the left is the brakes? mac or the thing on the right.

MAC: jump, for sa... 
MAC: you did activate the floaters.
GIN: activa...
MAC: i did say, 'finish up on the
GIN: um...
GIN: ...i wouldn't do that.
MAC: excuse me?
GIN: well...i saw our suction things. lying...over...there?
GIN: or maybe. i put 'em there. and points. to where they are.
MAC: i like a quick study.

MAC: ...no matter how many stones we make, the diamonds are just an appetizer. gin and the meal...? 
MAC: my contract. with debeers.
GIN: oh my g...
MAC: sensible folks, debeers. a world monopoly in diamonds based on one simple principle...something's only priceless if it's scarce.
MAC: these guys dig up all the diamonds on the planet, just to keep them
MAC: imagine the chaos
MAC: we're sort of bounty hunters.
MAC: our machine is worth
STEWARD: when you missed cocktails.
MAC: or my name's not banquo macduff.

MAC: ...well, i 
GIN: time has come to tell you. what business. i'm actually in.
MAC: not here.
MAC: it only looks dangerous...
MAC: you couldn't fall off. unless someone threw you over.
MAC: more intimate. for a confession.
MAC: what business. you are actually. in.
GIN: yeh. i'm not an art dealer.
MAC: of course not. you're a cop.
MAC: an insurance investigator for webber assurance, your boss is an named hector cruz, you've been there four years and ten months, you're quite the rising star. gin nope. his head tilts. just a little farther. mac nope?
GIN: i'm a thief, mac.
GIN: for five years, i've used the database of every client webber has to plan my jobs. museums, banks, jewelers, rich people, i have floor plans, alarm codes, passwords, the works.
GIN: i've made a fortune. it's not enough.
MAC: why n...
GIN: why wasn't it enough for you?
GIN: the vermeer that was stolen from hancock tower? that was my job. i scaled the building with electromagnets, and parachuted down an air vent...
GIN: ...
GIN: i need a partner. for the biggest, smartest, job. ever. the one you retire off of, because nothing else could ever compare with the rush.
MAC: ever. is such a long time.
GIN: this is a job that can only be done in
GIN: eight
GIN: you're not a real trusting guy.
MAC: and i tried so hard to hide that.
GIN: it's two jobs. the first steals something priceless from the national palace museum in taipei. we don't keep that. we trade it in for our ticket to the show.
MAC: one moment in time, you s...
GIN: midnight, july 1, 1997. eight days from now. the moment that hong kong is annexed by china.
GIN: 80-20 split.
MAC: don't be so hard on yourself. it's your plan, you should take at least thirty perc...

MAC: what are you gonna do with six billion dollars that you can't do with four? 
GIN: hold the record. alone.
MAC: your share is 50%. and one dollar.
GIN: i like what you left. in the hold.
MAC: you didn't even see wha...
GIN: a lump of coal. a pair of pliers. a note that said, 'squeeze hard'.
GIN: squeeze hard.

GIN: that's madame chiang kaishek, she's my bud. an evil streak a mile wide. 
MAC: no surprise.
GIN: i have a lot on my mind.
MAC: you look beautiful doing it.
GIN: you wanna buy a vermeer?
MAC: rather steal it.
GIN: been there, done that.
GIN: national palace museum, taipei, taiwan. repository of four thousand years of chinese culture...
GIN: works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx, pots and scrolls, paintings and porcelains and lacquer work. every treasure the kuomintang could loot before the reds took over. ever rob the place?
MAC: no. if memory serves.
GIN: you need to eat something, or are you ready for sex? and just at the edge of it... mac the options seem so limited. they jump through the opening. and vanish.

MAC: ginny...? 
MAC: good morning.
MAC: quite a parting gift. i would have settled for roses.
GIN: it's a joke. you know, a joke? people who have a sense of humor make them?
GIN: you're rich, go buy an american, have him fill you in on the culture.
MAC: ah. american culture. well, that
MAC: is it easier now? not pretending.
MAC: not pretending you're an innocent. not pretending you...like me.
MAC: here's a tip from an old-timer. never forget who you are...
MAC: it gives you someone to be. when you stop pretending.
GIN: because the museum displays 10,000 relics at any given moment. but there are 60
GIN: the train shuttles relics to and from storage. it looks exactly like that. so mac looks down the line. at the train car.
GIN: i've been down the air ducts four times. the train always has two armed guards. always travels between 32 and 36 miles per hour. relics don't like to be jostled too much. mac your model has five vents.
GIN: we go down the first. back up the third, if you're lucky. if not, we
MAC: seems like overkill. for one simple jump.
GIN: well, it's an eight billion dollar jump. you miss the train...you've missed the train.
GIN: we've got five days to grab the bones, trade them for the scan, and pull our 8 billion out of hong kong.
MAC: ...we've missed the train, yeh.
GIN: oh. have i neglected to fill in the details?
MAC: an oversight.
GIN: which i learned from the master. hey. wish me luck...
MAC: i'm too

GIN: five years, you won't need make-up. 
MAC: we agreed. no underwear.
GIN: overkill. i can do it with legs.
MAC: i'd lose the underwear.

GIN: the oracle bones date back to the shang dynasty, 3500 years ago. they are writings...carved into ox bones, tortoise shells... 
GIN: the oldest chinese writing any- where, the first proof of chinese civilization.
MAC: what makes
GIN: there we are.
GIN: last year, ancient artifacts were discovered in the gulf of mexico. an olmec civilization, 3200 years old.
GIN: amazingly, markings on these olmec figures were identified as shang dynasty writing...

GIN: ...no, i don't think that way. 
GIN: ...and i suppose you do?
MAC: get lonely? sure, all the time. it's healthy.
MAC: what's unhealthy. is denial.
GIN: be real. you could never see yourself...you know, quitting the game. settling...down.
MAC: why, ginger. this is so sudden.

MAC: you're in charge of ego and worrying. i'm in charge of keeping you alive. 
MAC: these are plasma jet. all the force is directed forward, instead of dissipating in a sphere like a grenade.
GIN: i don't need th... mac shut up.
MAC: you don't trust me, you won't get through this.
MAC: try to adjust to that for three more days. after july 1...
MAC: ...you'll never have to trust again.
MAC: something. to look forward to.

INCONVENIENCE?: the train louder, closer, the alarm blaring... 
GIN: they've got an

BUTLER: will you please come this way? 
MAC: i like this.
GIN: you like wha...
MAC: not being told what the we're doing.
GIN: you're on a 'need to know' basis. you'll get each step in time to execute, i thought you agreed to those condit... mac i like your not trusting me. because it frees me to do the same. they come upon the spacious grounds behind the mansion. a
GIN: i trust you. i only need to...
MAC: ...remain in control.
MAC: which is a sign of weakness.
MAC: i like that, too.
GIN: colonel
QIU: you look lovely, ginger. is the rose for me?
GIN: of course.
GIN: col. qiu lai chuen, this is andrew macdougal.
GIN: real names here, darling. the colonel and i have every incentive to keep each other's secrets.
QIU: like the place, andy?
MAC: please. mr. macdougal will do.
QIU: this way. doesn't matter if we spill.
MAC: my sentiments exactly.
QIU: this place was a gift. from its former owner. a brit whose business will now happily continue to function. perhaps...even expand. mac planning to spend much time here?
QIU: tho it has required many sacrifices.
GIN: the colonel has divorced his wife. to facilitate the necessary entertaining of western women.
QIU: tho some are more entertaining than others.
MAC: colonel. you are touching the woman i love...
MAC: from time to time.
QIU: you're a scot. would you like some 25-year-old macallan?
MAC: sure, i'll take a case.
GIN: the colonel told his minister of culture that he could mount a surgical raid to liberate this treasure from taiwan.
MAC: ah. how much was the minister told the raid would cost? qiu counting equipment, personnel, bribes, an even fifty million american. all in.
MAC: which you can now keep.
QIU: he would have paid twice that. but my needs are modest.
QIU: unlike. the woman you love. from time to time.
GIN: how do i look, honey?
MAC: like a woman. of mystery.

GIN: in the hong kong and shanghai bank building. is a room with two computers. one for you. 
MAC: glad i have a function, here.
