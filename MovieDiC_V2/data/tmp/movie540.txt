OPHTHALMOLOGIST: no. could be. but i think we need to get you to a neurologist. nothing urgent. 
CADEN: a neurologist?
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: yes, a brain expert.

CADEN: i thought maybe you said urologist. 
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: for a look-see. the eyes are part of the brain, after all.
CADEN: that's not true, is it?
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: why would i say it if it weren't true?
CADEN: it just doesn't seem right.
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: like morally correct? or right as in accurate?
CADEN: i'm not sure. accurate, i guess.
OPHTHALMOLOGIST: hmm. interesting.

CLAIRE: willy, you coming up!!!! 
TOM: sssssh!!
CLAIRE: willy?
CLAIRE: willy? answer me!...willy!
CLAIRE: no!!!
DAVIS: pop!!

CADEN: please. that was good, tom. 
TOM: yeah? i was trying something different. i was crashing differently. ambivalently.
CADEN: i saw that. i like it.
CADEN: try to keep in mind that a young person playing loman thinks he's only pretending to be at the end of a life full of despair. but the tragedy is that we know that you, the young actor, will end up in this very place of desolation.
TOM: okay.

CADEN: great. let's try it again. 
CADEN: how long, david?
DAVID: i think fifteen.
CADEN: why don't you get cleaned up, tom, and we'll go again.

HAZEL: i just heard the death of the salesman. 
CADEN: in more ways than one.
HAZEL: oh no.

HAZEL: signal's good here, oddly. 
CADEN: that is odd.
HAZEL: i know! cell phones, they're crazy!
CADEN HAZEL: see you in a few. yup.

HAZEL: i keep reading the first line. it's a good line, i think. but i don't know much about literature. 
CADEN: maybe you should read the first line of another series of books.
HAZEL: i'm trying to better myself, caden. recommend me something. you're a genius; you must've read nearly a dozen books.
CADEN: exactly twelve. have you read kafka?

CADEN: his whole name? 
HAZEL: okay, not his entire name. heinz?
CADEN: you should read the trial, maybe.
HAZEL: if you say so, i will. can't wait till wednesday. i'm so excited to see it.
CADEN: i hope you like it.
HAZEL: it's pretty impossible that i won't, you know. i mean...

CADEN: i think i have blood in my stool. 
ADELE: that stool in your office?

ADELE: when i was pregnant with olive... 
MADELINE: what was it like?

ADELE: um... i don't know. hopeful or something. like something was going to change. 
MADELINE: something did, no?
ADELE CADEN: yes, of course. yes. i mean... big time.
ADELE: maybe not as much as i had hoped.
MADELINE: there are no terrible things to say in here. only true and false.
ADELE: i feel alone sometimes. i feel exhausted. can i say something awful?
MADELINE: yes. please do.
ADELE: i've fantasized about caden dying and being able to start again.

CADEN: it's a nightmare in there. 
HAZEL: the car crash?
CADEN: well... not only.
HAZEL: sorry. so i'm reading the trial.
CADEN: yeah? you like?

HAZEL: love. i'm such an for not knowing about this book. it's famous, it turns out. 
CADEN: you're not an

CADENHAZEL: in fact, you're very bright,
CADEN: then what do i say?

ADELE: thanks. how was rehearsal?
CADEN: awful. we have five hundred and sixty lighting cues. i don't know why i made it so complicated.
ADELE: it's what you do.

TOM: i said nothing happened. didn't you hear me?
CLAIRE: don't you feel well?
TOM: i'm tired to death. i couldn't make it. i just couldn't make it, linda.
CLAIRE: where were you all day? you look terrible.
TOM: i got as far as a little above yonkers. i stopped for a cup of coffee... maybe it was the coffee.

CLAIRE: what? 
TOM: i suddenly couldn't drive any more. the car kept going off onto the shoulder, y'know?

CADEN: yeah. absolutely. sorry. i have a bit of a headache. 
CLAIRE: i just want to thank you for everything. you've been absolutely brilliant and it's going to be miserable going ahead without you.
CADEN: i'll be around. i'll check in.
CLAIRE: i'm such a baby.
CLAIRE: i'm going to get drunk, that's what.
CADEN: ok, claire.
HAZEL: i figured i'd better get in fast.
CADEN: hey!
HAZEL: i loved it! and, by the way, claire is trouble. and not terribly bright.
HAZEL: just wanted you to know the word on the street.

CADEN: so you liked it? 
HAZEL: are you kidding? i cried for like fifteen minutes after. i loved every minute of it. except claire.
CADEN: easy on the eyes.
HAZEL: oh, caden, not you, too. what i want to know is why she started crying in her last monologue, right after she had the line, 'i can't cry for you willy...'?
CADEN: she felt very strongly that it was right.
HAZEL: where's el wife-o?
CADEN: had to work. her berlin show is in two weeks. we're going to spend like a month there.

REALTOR: the sellers are very motivated now. 
HAZEL: it's a scary decision. i never thought i'd buy a house alone. but, y'know, i'm 36, and i wonder what i'm really waiting for.

OLIVE: i don't know what that means.
CADEN: well, there's two different kinds of psychosis. they're spelled differently. p-s-y is like if you're crazy and s-y is like these things on my face.

DOCTOR: we'll get you enrolled a biofeedback program. maybe you can learn some sort of manual override.

HAZEL CADEN: be quiet, squishy.hi. 
HAZEL: caden, i won't be yet another woman you feel guilty about.

CADEN: okay. thank you anyway. 
HAZEL: here. take this. i got like five for christmas. christmas.

MADELINE: that's wonderful. bless! i guess you'll have to discover your real self. right? 
CADEN: yeah, i mean, yeah. oh, i wanted to ask you, how old are kids when they start to write?
MADELINE: varies.
CADEN: could a four year old keep a diary?
MADELINE: listen, there's an absolutely brilliant novel written by a four year old.
CADENMADELINE: really?little winky. by horace azpiazu.
CADEN: aww. cute.
MADELINE: hardly. little winky is a virulent anti-semite.

MADELINE: the story follows his initiation into the klan, his immersion in the pornographic snuff industry and his ultimate degradation at the hands of a black ex-convict named eric washington jackson jones... johnson... jefferson, with whom he embarks on a brutal homosexual affair. 
CADEN: wow. written by a four year old?

MADELINE: azpiazu killed himself at five. 
CADEN: that's horrible.
MADELINE: he would've written so much more had he lived. they developed a method -- some software -- to determine what he would've written had he lived to ten, twenty, thirty, etcetera.
CADEN: is that possible?
MADELINE: which part?
CADEN: any of it. why did he kill himself?
MADELINE: i don't know, why did you?
CADEN: what?
MADELINE: i said, why would you?
CADEN: oh. i don't know.

CLERK: can i help you? 
CADEN: i'm looking for a christmas present for my daughter. something pink.
CLERK: how about this?
CADEN: yes. that's good.

CADEN: the idea is to do a massive theater piece. uncompromising, honest. i don't know what it is yet or how to do it, but it'll come. it'll reveal itself. 
HAZEL: huh.
CADEN: hereãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s what i think theater is: itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s the beginning of thought. the truth not yet spoken. itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s a blackbird in winter. the moment before death. itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s what a man feels after heãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s been clocked in the jaw. itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s love... in all its messiness. and i want all of us, players and audience alike, to soak in the communal bath of it, the mikvah, as the jews call it. weãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢re all in the same water, after all, soaking in our very menstrual blood and nocturnal emissions. this is what i want to try to give people, hazel. and i want your help.

HAZEL: what are you doing? 
CADEN: salivating.
CADEN: i have to concentrate.
CADEN: biofeedback training.
HAZEL: huh.
CADEN: so i was wondering if you'll help.
HAZEL: in your box office?
CADEN: no. like as my assistant.
HAZEL: i'm not sure i can work with you, caden. i'm kind of angry.
CADEN: i just want to normalize it, hazel. i think we'd have fun together.
CADEN: i miss you.
CADEN: i'm digesting.
HAZEL: it's really disturbing.

CADEN: i've been thinking a lot about dying lately. 
CLAIRE: you're going to be fine, sweetie.
CADEN: i appreciate that, claire, but --
CLAIRECADEN: well, you are. you poor regardless of how this thing.particular thing works itself out, i will be dying. so will you.
CLAIRECADEN: caden!so will everyone here. and i want to explore that unflinchingly.
CADEN: we are all hurtling toward death.

CLAIRE: i just think it's... brave. i feel like i'm going to be part of a revolution. i keep thinking artaud. i keep thinking krapp's last tape.
CADEN: i don't know what i'm doing.
CLAIRE HAZEL: but that's what's so ... cryptology... refreshing. i mean, how much prepackaged ...
CLAIRE: ... theater can we take as a country? y'know? knowing that you don't know is the first and most essential step to knowing. y'know?

CLAIRE HAZEL: i'm proud of you.ptolemy was the first to divide the day into 24...
CLAIRE: so tell me what you want from me?
CADEN: hmm?
CLAIRE: from my character.

CADEN: oh. well, we'll build it over time together. find a real person, maybe, to model it after.

CLAIRE: that hazel girl is kind of interesting, maybe. as a model.
CADEN: um, yeah. something to think about. sure. although --

CLAIRE HAZEL: it's late. ... and the jet, it exploded, and she was sent plummeting.

CADEN: when i get tired i have to remember to breathe. it's a new thing. my autonomic functions are failing.
CLAIRE: poor darling. it's fine.

CADENCLAIRE: i'm just ... shh. shh. shh. shh. shh. 
HAZEL: whitrow says, "if a mind is regarded to be a memory-based process of integration..."

CLAIRE: my mother died last night. 
CADEN: my i'm so sorry. what are you doing out?
CLAIRE: ugh, i couldn't deal with my sisters. it's like living in a heironymous bosch painting.
CADEN: oh. i see. well, um, what happened to your mother, if i could ask? i mean, that's an awful thing to ask. i'm sorry. i don't mean to -- it's just that, i'm --
CLAIRE: oh, this is me. no, it's okay. she fell. slipped in her bathroom. hit her head. it actually split in half. horrible.
CADEN: in half?
CLAIRE: yes. well, it was nice meeting you. did i say "meeting"? ugh, i'm such an

CADEN CLAIRE: slip of the tongue is all.freudian slip. 
CADEN: i don't know how it's freudian.
CLAIRE: y'know. like "meet"? to meet?
CADEN: oh. well, i'm sorry about your mother. in half?
CLAIRE: it's okay. it's life. it's --
CADEN: what is it? what?
CADEN: do you want me to drive you home?
CLAIRE: sometimes when i cry, i watch myself so i can remember how it looks for future roles. it's horrible. i hate myself.
CADEN: it's okay. everyone does that.

CADEN: i'm so sorry. 
CLAIRE: i was a baby girl with hair of spun gold, the prettiest baby anyone had ever seen. one day the townsfolk, who were jealous of my beauty, decided to steal me away.

CLAIRECADEN: there was a knock at thegod, you're beautiful. door. 
CLAIRE: it was a bearded old man.
CLAIRE: he said to me, "young lady, i have in my satchel a ring. whomever possesses it will receive all the magic of the woodland sprites."
CLAIRE: he said, "there is one more thing. you must never tell anyone what you promised me. if you do, you will die."

CLAIRE: so i used my new power to kill all the townsfolk. horrible, humiliating deaths. i was reunited with my family. and i lived happily ever after, doing only good with my new powers. caden cries and rests his head on her thigh. 
CLAIRE: why are you crying, honey?
CADEN: i'm so in love with you.
CADEN: i have problems, claire. i'm still attached to my wife. i have also -- i have also -- feelings for hazel.
CLAIRE: really? hazel? oh. really? our hazel? that's really interesting. i must've picked that up unconsciously. wow. boy. gosh.
CADEN: i've left them behind. i've gone somewhere without them. i'm guilty of so much.
CLAIRE: it's okay. we'll be fine. you're with me now. we'll be good.

CLAIRE: she's 36. works in a theater box office. she had acting aspirations but lacked the confidence to pursue them. her life is passing by. she is alone. she's old and ugly -- 
CADEN: i think you should pick another subject. other than hazel.
CLAIRE: sacred ground?
CADEN: no. it's just. i don't feel like there's enough there.
CLAIRE: i suppose not. she is limited. okay. there's this single mother who lives downstairs. i find her really deep and sad.
CADEN: tell me.
CLAIRE: i'm 42. i have a small child and no husband. i work long hours as a cashier at a mini-mart. sometimes i worry my child will not even recognize me when i come home --

CLAIRECADEN: caden, i've made ai have to go find my breakthrough. this woman is daughter.

SAMMY: peek-a-boo.

SAMMY: a mythical beast with and eternally fused, two pair of eyes that look only at each other, lips ever touching and one voice that whispers to itself. 
CADEN: yes, okay. you've got the part.
HAZEL: he's good, caden.

CADEN: i was thinking of calling it simulacrum. what do you think?
CLAIRE: i don't know what it means.
ARIEL: can me have a nickel if i doesn't play with my pee-pee no more?

CADEN: how about the flawed light of love and grief? 
CLAIRE: i'm not sure.

CLAIRE: i'm going to work in my journal. 
CADENSAMMY: no, thanks.no, thanks, claire.
CADEN: claire? i want you to drop your study of mrs. kranstein.
CLAIRE CADEN: caden -- i want you to play yourself. sammy's going to move into your apartment set as me.

SAMMY: it'd be my honor to play your husband, claire. you're an amazing actress. i saw you in bernarda alba last year at the roundabout. 
CLAIRE: yeah? that was a fun play. emotionally tough, but fulfilling.

CLAIRE: and i loved working with so many strong female actresses. ugh, lorca's a genius. okay. i'm going to start thinking about myself. 
SAMMY: start, huh?
SAMMY: why did we leave adele, caden?
CADEN: she left us. you know that better than anyone. except me.
SAMMY: amazing artist though. the best living artist. there's no one who stares the truth in the face like she does. a sweet pussy, too.
CADEN: how do you know that?
SAMMY: oh. i read it.
CADEN: anyway, i don't know where she is. a strange dirigible flies very low overhead.
SAMMY: maybe she's got a sublet in new york. maybe the met's doing a retrospective. maybe, baby.
CADEN: why are you giving this to me?
SAMMY: i want to follow you there and see how you lose even more of yourself.

OLD PERSON: i asked you to hold the door. 
CADEN OLD PERSON: i'm sorry. i pressed it, butyou didn't press it. i think it was too late.
CADEN: have a good night.

OLD PERSON: frances, i need to go to the clinic. something's terribly wrong with my nose. 
OLD PERSON #2: oh yes. i see.
OLD PERSON #2: are you ellen? ellen?!
CADEN: what?

OLD PERSON #2: oh dear.

CADEN: i went for a walk. i had to think. 
CLAIRE: all night? you smell weird. are you wearing lipstick?
CADEN: no! what do i smell like? like bad? like an old person?
CLAIRE: i don't know. like mold? i don't know. like mold and ... cleaning products? like you're menstruating? i don't know!

CLAIRE: i don't like that guy you got to play you. 
SAMMY: you don't like sammy? why? i think he's good.
CLAIRE: i think you need to fire him.
CLAIRE: oh, you. i'm forty-five years old. i don't want to do this anymore.
SAMMY: i'm not firing him, claire. he's the best thing in the show. next to you.
CLAIRE: he's coming on to me. he's feeling my during rehearsal.
SAMMY: he's your husband.
CLAIRE: he's not my godamn husband! you are! what is wrong with you?

CADEN SAMMY: good, jimmy! it's for the play. we're getting at something real here. 
CLAIRE: ugh! i'm going to rehearsal.
CADEN: that's great, you guys.
CADEN: beautiful, sammy.
SAMMY: caden, time out?
CADENSAMMY: what's up? i feel we need a hazel in here. there's a whole side of caden i'm not able to explore without a hazel.
CADEN: i guess, yeah.
HAZEL: i get to be a character? hooray!

CLAIRE: caden, what are you doing at night? 
SAMMY: i've been going to adele's place. and cleaning it.
CLAIRE: do you know what i've given up for you? for this. for you. for you.

SAMMY CLAIRE: i'm sorry.i -- i thought i wanted to be just a working stage actress. but, y'know, i'm watching all the young girls crowding me out and it's -- 
CLAIRE: get the door. please. just...
TAMMY: uh-oh. this looks serious. am i interrupting?
SAMMY: what's going on, hazel?
TAMMY: just wanted to tell you the girl playing me is able to start today.
SAMMY CLAIRE: oh, good. that's good.that's all we need around here, two hazels.
TAMMY: okay. i'll take that as my cue.
CLAIRE: maybe you can clean her toilet.
SAMMY: maybe i will.
CLAIRE: it's over, caden.
SAMMY: claire, no.
CLAIRE: i'm not talking to you.

CADEN: i didn't say i was going to clean hazel's toilet. he did. 
CLAIRE: but you thought it.
CADEN: i thought it. but i didn't say it.
CLAIRE: i got an offer to do needleman in a haystack and i'm going to take it. i want you out of the apartment. the real one. you can keep this one.
CADEN: claire! please!
HAZEL: already put out a call for a claire replacement. would you really clean my bathroom?
CADEN: yeah.
HAZEL: caden, it's all so

CLAIRE: oh, needleman, you had such potential. but iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m afraid iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m going to have to move on. 
ACTOR: just like that? you donãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢t give a guy even a chance?
CLAIRE: iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m not a chance-giving girl. iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m a fun-loving girl. remember?
ACTOR: i try to be fun-loving. see?
CLAIRE: my analyst says you have complexes.
ACTOR: once you enjoyed needlemanãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s complexes.
CLAIRE: thatãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s before my analyst taught me that my enjoyment of them was a sign of my suppressed non- enjoymnent of them.
ACTOR: i hate your analyst.

CLAIRE: she told me your hatred of her is a sign of your latent homosexuality. 
CADEN: this is the end of my stuff.
CLAIREACTOR: bye.bye.

SAMMY: morning, haze. 
TAMMY: hi, caden. how was your night?
SAMMY: okay. yours?
TAMMY: eh. philip was colicky. i was up all night.

CADEN: hazel, what do you think of this title: unknown, unkissed, and lost? 
HAZEL: eh. caden this is millicent weems.
CADEN: hi, millicent. have a seat. how are you at cleaning?
MILLICENT: i'm very, very good at it.
CADEN: because this part requires a lot of it. you'd play a cleaning lady.
MILLICENT: i played egga the cleaning lady in hedda gabler at the roundabout.

CADEN: you're weirdly close to what i've visualized for this character. 
MILLICENT: glad to be weirdly close.

CADEN: where're sammy and hazel? 
CADEN: hey, sammy, what are you doing?
SAMMY: hi, caden. i'm being you. you like hazel; i like hazel.
CADEN: this hazel doesn't exist for you. if you want to like a hazel, like that one.

CADENHAZEL: hazel. what? 
CADEN: you don't like him, do you?
HAZEL: kind of. he reminds me of you.
CADEN: i'm me. you don't need someone to remind you of me.

HAZEL: don't worry, caden. i like you more. i do. sammy's just fun. 
CADEN: i'm fun.
HAZEL: oh, sweetie. no, you're not.
CADEN VOICE: yes?is this caden cotard?

CADEN: was my father standing with us? 
TAMMY: i don't know what he looks like.
CADEN: he's dead. he looks dead, i guess.
TAMMY: probably wasn't him then.
CADEN: a little moustache?
CADE: anyway, thanks for coming with me.

TAMMY: it's okay. 
CADEN: i asked hazel but she was busy tonight and you're the next best thing. i mean, it isn't that you're the next best thing but because you play her, it feels comforting. does that make sense? although the thing is offstage you're nothing like her. you play her very well though. did hazel mention what she was doing tonight because i called her house before we left and her husband said she wasn't going to be back till late and i thought that was weird because she told me philip was sick.
TAMMY: she's going to dinner with sammy.
CADEN: that's interesting.

TAMMY: don't forget your phone. 
CADEN: thank you, yammy.
CADEN: hey. what you up to?

HAZEL'S VOICE: in my car. heading to dinner with sammy. 
CADEN: why didn't you tell me that before?
HAZEL: caden. i don't want to say things that are going to make you sad.
CADEN: it mostly makes me sad that it doesn't make you sad.
HAZEL: you want me to be sad that someone's taking me out to dinner?
CADEN: i want you to be sad that we had something really special and it's going away!
HAZEL: it just happened, caden. i didn't plan it. you were with claire. this probably isn't going to go anywhere, sweetie. i'm still your girl.

CADEN: he has stories about me! 
HAZEL: caden, i know everything about you and it's all adorable. i love you and i always will. so don't worry. i gotta go, i'm there.

CADEN: did you always want to be an actress? 
TAMMY: every girl wants to be an actress.
CADEN: is that true?
TAMMY: i did. so i figure everyone does.

CADEN: i thought someone would've cleaned it up. 
TAMMY: who?
CADEN: i don't know! someone.
CADEN: this is my room. you can sleep here.
TAMMY: where will you sleep?
CADEN: the living room couch.
TAMMY: don't you want to sleep with me?

CADEN TAMMY: um... it's just sex. 
CADEN: okay. if you think it's okay.
CADEN: how can you be like that?
TAMMY: i get undressed every day.
CADEN: in front of someone is different.
TAMMY: i don't see why.
CADEN: maybe because you have a beautiful body. maybe that makes it easier.
TAMMY: i suppose it might. do you want to
CADEN: i do. yes. um. do you?
TAMMY: it'd be fine.
CADEN: i'm sorry. i'm very lonely. i don't know what's wrong. i just -- i'm sorry. can you understand? do you understand loneliness?
TAMMY: yeah, i mean, i don't know. i feel okay mostly. might help.
CADEN: i'm sorry.
TAMMY: it's okay. i don't mind. take your clothes off.

TAMMY: thanks. 
CADEN: sometimes i wish i were pretty like that.

CADEN: no. no. i like women. i only like women.
TAMMY: well, i'm getting cold.

TAMMY: pretty caden.
CADEN: thanks. thank you for saying that.
TAMMY: come to bed, pretty caden.

TAMMY: what is attractive? how are attractive people treated, how do they feel? how do unattractive people feel, how are they treated? how do attractive people feel about unattractive people, how do unattractive people feel about attractive people? how do unattractive people feel about other unattractive people? how do attractive people feel about other attractive people? how do unattractive men feel about unattractive women? how do unattractive men feel about attractive women? how do attractive men feel about unattractive women? how do attractive women feel about unattractive men? how do old people feel about attractive people? how do attractive people feel about old people? this is my study. 
CADEN: that's hazel's house.
TAMMY: huh. do you think we should have a hazel's house on the set for me?
CADEN: um...
TAMMY: it would be verisimilitudinous.
CADEN: yeah. i don't know. i have to speak to the fire marshal.
TAMMY: it would be very verisimilitudinous if you could.

CADEN: hank! okay! 
TAMMY: my house!
HAZEL: is there no end to your kissing?
CADEN: it's verisimilitudinous. i'm thinking of that as a title.
HAZEL: whatever. i've got work to do. tell your girlfriend to get out here if she wants a ride back.
CADEN: she's not my girlfriend.
HAZEL: give it a rest, caden. i can smell her on your breath.
CADEN: tammy! we have to get back.

SAMMY: jeremy is playing to us. tell him he simply needs to talk to donna. we'll hear what we hear. 
CADEN: sammy's explaining too much. feels expository. needs to be shorthand, like, "jeremy big."
TAMMY: caden? can we stop for a second?
CADEN: sure.
TAMMY: if hazel's in love with sammy and caden's in love with hazel, there would be a dramatic confrontation, where caden turns to me and says, "it's obvious he's a substitute for me." i think then hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry. i'm not sure which yet, but it feels dramatically sound.
HAZEL: that didn't happen, caden.
TAMMY: i think hazel would do that, hazel.
HAZEL: but hazel hasn't done it, tammy.

TAMMYCADEN: caden? what do you think?i think we could try it. 
TAMMYHAZEL: great!fuck. i'm going out for a smoke.
CADEN: let's try it. maybe it could happen at the director's table.

CADEN: tammy was right. i don't understand why you're with sammy. 
HAZEL: he's nice. he's available. he me without crying.
CADEN: that happened one time! you him?
HAZEL: yes! and you and i only one time that's why you only cried one time! i give you endless opportunities.
CADEN: what do you mean, he's available?
HAZEL: derek left. because of you!
CADEN: when? how come you never told me?
HAZEL: i don't know, caden. how come a lot of things? it's not like we can start fresh, like sammy and i can. there's all this pressure on us. we're finally both free and there's all this pressure.

HAZEL: that's such a romantic response. 
CADEN: it's not my response. it just crossed my mind. we have enormous budgetary concerns here.
HAZEL: ugh. forget it. derek is played by joe --

CADEN: she looks like you. and -- 
HAZELCADEN: no she does not. -- and she offered to have with me. abernathy?
HAZEL: yes. was it good?
CADEN: i don't know. yeah. it was nice.
HAZELCADEN: ugh. i'm just trying to be honest. it was nice. not earth- shattering.
HAZEL: did you cry?
CADEN: no!
HAZEL: you're making progress.
CADEN: okay, i cried a little before. hazel, you've been part of me forever. don't you know that? i breathe your name in every exhalation.

HAZEL: oh, caden. oh, what the are we doing? 
CADEN: i don't know.
CADEN: crap, ellen's october 23rd scene!

CADEN: what's going on, maurice? 
MAURICE: sorry. we have a couple of new guys on and we're not in sync yet.
CADEN: okay. are we good to go?
MAURICE: yup.

OLD PERSON #2: are you ellen? ellen?!

MILLICENT: ok. thank you.
OLD PERSON #2: oh dear.

OLD PERSON #2: what?

MILLICENT: itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s the wrong key. it doesnãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢t turn. 
OLD PERSON #2: itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s the one they gave me.
ADELEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢Â‚Â¬Ã¢Â„Â¢S VOICE: iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m jumping in the shower. make some coffee, would ya?
CADEN: did you hear that?
HAZELCADEN: what?did we hire an adele?
HAZEL: iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m sure i wouldãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢ve remembered that. no.
MILLICENT: caden, youãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢re breaking the fourth wall. i get to open the door.
CADEN: this is the wrong key, sandy.
OLD PERSON #2: it isnãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢t.
CADEN: adele! adele, are you in there?
OLD PERSON #1: maybe itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s the wrong key.
CADEN: adele?
HAZEL: caden, there's no one in there. you've got to let go of her. she's not here anymore. i'm here.

CADEN: yeah, okay. can we just get the right key, so we can do the scene? 
HAZEL: yeah, we'll get the right key.

CADEN: look familiar? 
HAZEL: oh my it's an exact replica of the tethered maiden terrace! derek and the kids and i had so much fun on that trip!
CADEN: listen, i built this because i wanted to show you what happened --
SAMMY: after me, caden, there's no one left to watch you.
HAZEL SAMMY: there's nothing to talk
HAZEL SAMMY: coming up!
CADEN: no fair, sammy! she wouldn't see you jump. she never saw me! you're not being authentic.
SAMMY: this is where we part ways. this is authentic. this is what the real caden would do. this is what real love looks like.

CADEN: do you see what i'm saying? 
HAZEL: come over tonight? please?

CADEN: we could get a place together. we could get a loft. 
HAZEL: caden, that sounds nice. i miss my daughter. maybe she could come live with us.
CADEN: yeah. i miss olive. and the other one. the retarded one.
HAZEL: i'm a bad person.

CADEN: you can't cause someone to kill himself. he was troubled. 
HAZEL: i'm so ashamed of myself.
HAZEL: oh, caden. i wish we had this when we were young. and all the years in between. so many years, so fast.
HAZEL: what did we do?
CADEN: my heart aches so much for you.
HAZEL: we're here, caden. i'm here.
CADEN: i'm aching for it being over.
HAZEL: yeah. the end is built in to the beginning. what can you do?
CADEN: you're just perfect.
HAZEL: i'm a mess. but we fit, don't we.
CADEN: it doesn't always happen for me now. because of the medication and everything. i take a lot of pills.
HAZEL: i don't care. it's okay.

CADEN: i'm sorry. 
HAZEL: it's okay. it's different crying this time. i can tell. i'm crying, too. and i cried last time. after you left. i never told you. but i cried, too.
CADEN: i have a title. the obscure moon lighting an obscure world.
HAZEL: i think it might be too much.

MARIA: olive wants to see you. knows why; the way you abandoned her. 
CADEN MARIA: oh, shut up.she's had a fucked-up life with issues, thanks to you.
CADEN MARIA: you're insane.she's dying, is that insane enough for you?
MARIA: anyway, she wants to say goodbye to you. knows the why.

MARIA OLIVE: hello, darling. hi. 
MARIA: this is him.
OLIVE CADEN: hello.hi, olive. i've missed you so much.
OLIVE: maria, would you leave us?
MARIA: in heaven, my darling.
OLIVE: forgive me but no longer remember english. speak german?

CADEN OLIVE: no. i'm sorry.i had hope you have learned. 
OLIVE: i'm dying, as i'm sure maria told you. the flower tattoos have become infected and they're dying. so i am, as well. this is life.
CADEN: it's maria. she did this.
OLIVE: maria gave me reason to live once you left. the flowers defined me.
CADEN: your mother and maria took you away. i tried for years to find you. i didn't leave you.
OLIVE: you did something.
OLIVE: i want to talk to you about your homosexuality.
CADEN: what? i'm not a homosexual!
OLIVE: maria said you would deny it.
CADEN: she's lying to you.
OLIVE: i had the same struggle when i first fell in love with maria and we began to have dirty, aching sex.

CADEN: maria is your lover? 
OLIVE: of course. she introduced me to myself. to my and to hers.
CADEN: you have no idea how evil she is.
OLIVE: i need to forgive you before i die, but i can't forgive someone who has not asked for forgiveness.

OLIVE: i have no time! i need you to ask for forgiveness! 
CADEN: can you ever forgive me?
OLIVE: for what?
CADEN: for abandoning you.
OLIVE: "for abandoning you to have with my homosexual lover eric."
CADEN: for abandoning you to be have with my homosexual lover eric.
OLIVE: no. no, i'm sorry, i cannot.
MARIA: i hope you're happy, faggot.

HAZEL'S ANSWERING MACHINE: it's hazel. leave a message or don't. your dime. 
CADEN: my love. i know how to do the play. it'll take place over the course of one day. the day will be the day before you died, the happiest day of my life. i'll be able to relive it forever.

CADEN: i need a caden for my hazel. 
MILLICENT: i... i'd very much like to play caden.
CADEN: um...

MILLICENT: i know it would be non-traditional casting, but i think i'm right for it. i think i understand caden. 
CADEN: i don't understand him.
MILLICENT: caden cotard is a man already dead, living in a half-world between stasis and antistasis. time is concentrated and chronology confused for him. up until recently he has strived valiantly to make sense of his situation, but now he has turned to stone.
CADEN: okay. that sounds good.
MICHAEL: she's right? i didn't see that at all. i saw it all as more hopeful.

MICHAEL: any thoughts for today's rehearsal? 
CADEN: i have a new title, maybe.
MICHAEL: huh.
CADEN: the title is about a lot of things.
CADEN: are you gay, michael?
MICHAEL: yes. i don't see what that has to do with anything.
CADEN: do you know someone named eric?

TAMMY: come over tonight? please? 
MILLICENT: i'd like that.
CADEN: ok, take off the sweater.
TAMMY: i'm hot.
MILLICENT: yes, you are.
CADEN: smile shyly at each other.
MILLICENT: this is tedious. this is nothing.
MICHAEL: what's she doing?
TAMMY: he's directing.

MICHAEL: she's not getting the feel of you, caden. you don't move around. you don't talk to people. it's not -- 
MILLICENT: okay, folks, let's run it!
MINISTER: everything is more complicated than you think. you only see a tenth of what is true. there are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. but maybe you won't know for twenty years. and you'll never ever trace it to its source. and you only get one chance to play it out. just try and figure out your own divorce. and they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. but while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. and it never comes or it seems to but doesn't really. and so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come along. something to make you feel connected, to make you feel whole, to make you feel loved.

CADEN: millicent. 
CADEN: that was ... spectacular.
MICHAEL: it really was! delightful!
MILLICENTCADEN: thanks.i'm out of ideas. i'm dead.
MILLICENT: oh. i... could take over... as you... for a bit. until you feel refreshed.
MICHAEL: yes! yes!

CADEN: i need to keep my hand in. 
MILLICENT: well, ellen needs to be filled.
CADEN: filled? you mean...?

CADEN: i do like to clean. 
ADELE'S VOICE: ellen, olive has died. it's a time of overwhelming grief so please forgive my mess; i haven't been able to get out of bed. until today. much affection, a.

OLD PERSON #2: ellen? is your name ellen? 
CADEN: yes?
OLD PERSON #2: caden asked me to give you this.

MILLICENT'S VOICE: ... touched by the sadness of adele's neighbor. so close to death. reminds me of granny. i should really call her. remember how granny bascomb bounced me on her knee pretending to be a horsie. i loved that so much. say thank you to adele's neighbor. 
CADEN: thank you.
OLD PERSON #2: you're very welcome, young lady.
MILLICENT'S VOICE: now say, have a very good day.
CADEN: have a very good day.
OLD PERSON #2: i will indeed.

ELLEN: i'm making eggs. 
ELLEN: is everything okay, eric?
ERIC: everything's everything.

MOTHER: ellen, why do you look so serious? 
ELLEN: i'm going to remember this moment for the rest of my life, mama. and in exactly twenty years, come here with my daughter and have exactly the same picnic.
MOTHER: baby, that's the loveliest thing i've ever heard.

MILLICENT'S VOICE: i can't believe she said that to him! she's a slut, anyway. 
MILLICENT'S VOICE: maybe i can ask adele for a raise. it's been three years. i do a good job. i'm so tired tonight.

MALE VOICE: adele died of lung cancer last night. you may stay on if you like. 
MILLICENT'S VOICE: look shocked. weep.
MILLICENT'S VOICE: go into the kitchen and --

CADEN: hello. 
CADEN: where is everybody?
WOMAN: mostly dead. some have left.
CADEN: would you sit with me for a moment? i'm very tired. and lonely.
CADEN: i feel like i know you.
WOMAN: i was the mother in ellen's dream.
CADEN: yes! that's it. yes. you seem a bit older than i remember.
WOMAN: that dream was quite a while ago.
CADEN: i didn't mean to say you look old.

WOMAN: i know. 
CADEN: everyone's dreams in all those apartments. all those secrets we'll never know. that's the truth of it -- all the thoughts nobody will ever know.
WOMAN: it's true.
CADEN: i'm sorry the experiment didn't work. i wanted it to with all my heart. i wanted to do that picnic with my daughter. i feel i've disappointed you terribly.
WOMAN: no. no. i am so proud of you.
CADEN: all i want is someone to see me, someone to look at me with kindness. for me to be the most special person in the world to just one person.
WOMAN: i know, baby. i know.
WOMAN: you're going to be fine.
CADEN: i know what to do with this play now. i have an idea. i think -- the screen goes black fast.
