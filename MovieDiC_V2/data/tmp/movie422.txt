speaker10: mister mcmurphy!
speaker1: yes, ma'am...
speaker10: will you come with me, please.
speaker1: hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
speaker8: sure, mack!
speaker10: my name is miss ratched. i'm the head nurse here. you've already met miss pilbow and aides washington and warren.
speaker1: yes, ma'am.
speaker10: mister miller, this is mister mcmurphy, who'll be staying with us. greetings are exchanged as they pass through.
speaker10: we do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
speaker1: thank you, ma'am...
speaker10: this is your bed. you may leave your things in that cabinet.
speaker1: yes, ma'am...
speaker10: please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
speaker1: now that you mention it, i sure would like to call my aunt up in portland and tell 'er where i am so she can come visit me.
speaker10: all in good time, mister mcmurphy.
speaker1: yes, ma'am.
speaker10: good. now if you'll just go along with mister washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
speaker10: is there anything else?
speaker1: just that i'm glad to be here, miss ratched. i really am.
speaker10: good. i'm sure we'll be friends.
speaker1: yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
speaker10: yes. now go along, mister mcmurphy.
speaker1: yes, ma'am. lead the way, sam. they cross out of the men's dorm.
speaker11: what other work have you done?

speaker1: hell, doc, i've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the northwest till the army taught me what my natural bent was. 
speaker2: oh, what was that?
speaker1: poker!
speaker2: i see.
speaker1: yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
speaker2: in what way?
speaker1: they say i'm a habitual hassler. like i fight some. sheeut. they didn't mind so much when i was a logger and got into a hassle. that's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. but if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a criminal.
speaker2: i see...
speaker1: to tell the truth, ever since i found my natural callin' i done time in so many small-time jails i could write a brochure...
speaker2: yes... ah, do you know why you're here?
speaker1: well, ya know, doc... doesn't it say so there?
speaker2: well, according to the warden at pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'it appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.' what do you think of that report?
speaker1: i don't, doc...
speaker2: arrested on an assault charge five times...
speaker1: that's correct, doc ...
speaker2: the doctor at the prison states: 'don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' what do you say to that?
speaker1: doc, what can i tell ya?
speaker2: ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, mister murphy?
speaker1: no, this is my first trip, doc.
speaker2: well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, mister mcmurphy. i'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. so, i'd like your cooperation!
speaker1: you bet, doc!
speaker2: good. good.

speaker1: i'm tired. whew. o lord. oh, i'm awful tired... 
speaker2: somebody please see to mister bancini, so we can start the meeting.
speaker3: t-t-t-take it e-e-easy, p-p-p pete...
speaker1: awful tired...
speaker2: at the close of friday's meeting, we were discussing mister harding's problem, concerning his wife... mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. is that correct, mister harding?
speaker4: yes, that's perfectly correct.
speaker2: mister mcmurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. however, the cardinal rule, and i must emphasize this: everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
speaker5: yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
speaker2: yes... we were discussing mister harding's problem with his wife. now, who will start? billy.
speaker3: m-m-m-ma'am?
speaker2: would you like to start?
speaker3: n-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
speaker2: mister sefelt?
speaker2: mister fredrickson?
speaker2: mister taber?
speaker2: mister martini?
speaker6: no!
speaker2: mister scanlon?
speaker2: mister cheswick?
speaker2: am i to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter? mister harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
speaker4: yes, miss ratched, this is correct.
speaker2: but you have no proof.
speaker4: no, miss ratched...
speaker2: and yet you suspect her.
speaker4: yes, that is correct.
speaker2: why?
speaker4: i can only speculate as to the reasons why.
speaker2: have you ever speculated, mister harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
speaker4: miss ratched. given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that i held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that i can speculate on, at this late date, is how i will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
speaker7: what's he talkin' about?
speaker8: yeah, harding, why don't you knockoff the and get to the point.
speaker4: the point is, i will carry on until i fully understand what the function of that relationship is regardless of form or content.
speaker2: yes, billy?
speaker3: i-i-i-i-i d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
speaker8: yeah, harding, you're so i can't believe it.
speaker4: that's a matter of opinion.
speaker7: yeah, harding, where do you breathe anyway?
speaker9: through the ass.
speaker4: is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something?
speaker9: now what would i be trying to say?
speaker4: i don't know. i don't know, but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that.
speaker9: peculiar?
speaker7: why?
speaker8: yeah, why?
speaker10: yeah, tell us why.
speaker4: i hesitate to go on.
speaker2: no secrets, mister harding. let's get it all out in the open...
speaker4: i mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. i know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
speaker4: ... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then i say, categorically speaking, the with you, taber! i don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. no matter what i will carry on until i fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence...
speaker8: you know what, harding? i think you're some kind of morbid or something. you've been talking about your wife evere since i can remember. you know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose!
speaker9: yeah, wise up, harding.
speaker7: yeah, turn her loose!
speaker11: yeah, who do you think you are anyway?... he thinks he's almighty... he's a snob... he's a schmuck... dumbbell... creep... cretin... idiot... get rid of him... ship him upstairs...
speaker12: ffffffuck da wife...
speaker1: tired... awful tired...
speaker11: zap him... give 'im lobotomy... cut his nuts off... he doesn't have any... fag... pervert.
speaker1: i'm tired!
speaker2: somebody see to mister bancini.
speaker1: tired. tired. oh i'm tired...
speaker13: you a good boy, mistah bancini...
speaker1: you see... it's a lotta baloney...
speaker14: yes, yes, mister bancini, now if you'll just be calm...
speaker1: that's all it is, just a lotta baloney. ya see, i can't help it, can't...
speaker14: yes, i know, i know...
speaker1: ... don't ya see. i was born dead. not you. you wasn't born dead. ahhh, it's been so hard... tired... i'm tired... aw-ful tired... mcmurphy looks around at the others.

speaker1: catch it! catch it! 
speaker2: martini, there ain't nobody there, ya goon! go get the ball!
speaker1: no!
speaker1: i get it! i get it!
speaker3: well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those group ther'py shindigs? bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
speaker4: a pecking party?
speaker3: that's right, buddy. and you want to know who pecks the first peck?
speaker5: who? who?
speaker3: ah, come off it! it's that big nurse, that's who...
speaker4: it's as simple as that. you've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of freud, jung and maxwell jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.
speaker3: i'm not talking about fred yoong or maxwell jones, buddy, what i'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
speaker4: did to me?
speaker3: did to you and all the rest of you guys.
speaker6: y-y-yes! yes! y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
speaker3: what did i see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
speaker7: it's the questions she asks.
speaker3: tell 'er to go straight to hell!
speaker4: miss ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
speaker3: she ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
speaker3: she's peckin' at your balls, buddy, at your ever-lovin' balls.
speaker8: that kind of behavior will get you a p.a. rating, my friend.
speaker3: p.a. what the is that?
speaker8: potential assaultive.
speaker7: which gets you shipped up to disturbed for a nice little zap job.
speaker3: huh?
speaker4: electro-shock therapy, my friend. five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
speaker3: tell 'er to go to anyway!
speaker4: and if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to medical surgery.
speaker3: what for?
speaker4: lobotomy!
speaker3: lobotomy?
speaker4: that!

speaker1: is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'? 
speaker2: now, what would i be trying to say?
speaker3: gimme the ball!
speaker4: no. me! me!
speaker5: pass the ball, mcmurphy.
speaker1: pass it to me, martini.
speaker1: c'mon, i'll give it back!
speaker1: atta boy, martini.
speaker1: back and forth, that's it. shoot, man, we'll be takin' on the new york knicks before we're through...
speaker1: hey-ya, hey-ya, come on, come on, i'm waitin' on you suckers, you hit or you sit...

speaker4: she won't give me any more cigarettes!
speaker2: that okay. i'll take your marker.

speaker3: hit me!

speaker1: pardon me miss, but would you mind turning... 
speaker2: stay back! patients aren't allowed to enter the... oh, stay back!
speaker1: all i'm askin' is...
speaker2: oh, stay back, i'm a catholic!
speaker3: mister mcmurphy. patients aren't allowed in here.
speaker1: sorry, ma'am.

speaker1: pardon me, ma'am, can i ask you somethin'? 
speaker2: yes, mister mcmurphy?
speaker1: how 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
speaker2: that music is for everyone, mister mcmurphy.
speaker1: well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
speaker2: mister mcmurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. that music is all they have, and i wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
speaker1: sorry, ma'am... sorry 'bout that...
speaker1: sorry to have bothered you.
speaker2: not at all, mister mcmurphy...
speaker3: your medicine, mister mcmurphy.
speaker1: what's the horse pill for, honey?
speaker3: it's just medication, mister mcmurphy, good for you. now down it goes...
speaker1: look, miss, i don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
speaker3: don't get upset, mister mcmurphy...
speaker1: i'm not upset. all i wanna know, for the lovva jesus...
speaker2: that's all right, miss pilbow, if mister mcmurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
speaker1: no, that's okay, ma'am. down it goes.
speaker4: why didn't you tell her to go to hell, lover boy?
speaker5: yeah, whattsa matter, mack, she too much for ya?
speaker1: you boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
speaker4: i don't see you scoring any points, buddy. and you're just the man for the job, right?
speaker1: hell, i couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
speaker4: she's not all that homely, mister mcmurphy. in fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady. the men look at big nurse.
speaker6: big nurse is busy at her work.

speaker1: yeah, an' i'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... 
speaker2: me. hit me!

speaker1: le's get back to bed, mistah bromden... 
speaker2: chief? i wanna ask ya somethin'. oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? when you chew it in the morning, will it be too hard to bite? this question's got me goin', won't somebody set me right; does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? mcmurphy holds the last note, reaches over and rustles through his nightstand.
speaker2: here ya go, chief...

speaker1: time to got up! come on now, it's a beautiful day! let's not straggle! everybody up, up, up! 
speaker2: le's go, chief. le's go get ourselves all nice and clean... you too, mistah mack-murphy! washington goes off with bromden.

speaker1: mister mcmurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
speaker3: i wanna report a robbery!
speaker1: on this ward?
speaker3: yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
speaker1: oh, i had them removed.
speaker3: what for?
speaker1: patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
speaker1: mister washington!
speaker2: yes, miss ratched?
speaker1: please see to mister bromden.
speaker2: yes, miss ratched...
speaker1: now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast... you too, mister mcmurphy.
speaker3: well, say. how 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
speaker1: after breakfast, mister mcmurphy, after breakfast.
speaker3: you sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
speaker1: yes. now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.

speaker1: 'kay, let's go brush our teeth, fellas... 
speaker1: oh, lulu had a baby, his name was sunny jim, she put 'im in a pot, to teach 'im how to swim. oh, he swam to the bottom, he swam to the top, lulu got excited, an' pulled 'im by his... cock-tail ginger-ale, five cents a glass, an' if ya don't like it ya can shove it up your... ask me no more questions, i'll tell ya no more lies.

speaker1: what's wrong with you guys? 
speaker1: why, if i'd have known how soft this place was gonna be, i'd have arranged for my transfer sooner... look at this here, real orange juice! hooee, that's good. why, you couldn't pay me to leave this place! all this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up...
speaker1: stand aside, sam, nature's callin'.
speaker2: nobody leaves here till seven thirty.

speaker1: don't know if i can hold it that long, sam. 
speaker2: tha's your problem.
speaker1: who do you like in the opening game, sam?
speaker2: huh?
speaker1: mcmurphy turns and walks away.
speaker3: i wanna know about my cigarettes!

speaker1: sit down, mister cheswick. 
speaker2: no, i ain't no kid to have my cigarettes keep from me like cookies! ain't that right, mack! mack???
speaker1: sit down, mister cheswick!
speaker1: you should have thought about that before you gambled all your cigarettes away. is that clear?
speaker1: mister cheswick, is that clear!
speaker3: yeah...
speaker1: good... now, as i recall, we were making quite a bit of headway, last time, with mister harding's problem. so, does anyone care to begin?
speaker1: yes, mister mcmurphy.
speaker4: right... i've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' i got a few things i wanna get off my chest, before we get back to harding's problem.
speaker1: certainly, mister mcmurphy.
speaker4: right!
speaker4: 'kay... item one... i've been thinkin' 'bout the age problem we got on this ward. you know, the young an' old livin' together, an' i was thinkin' what a great thing it would be if the music was turned up louder. louder so the old fellas could hear better... doctor spivey nods with approval. big nurse doesn't.
speaker4: but then i got to thinkin', the music is so loud already, it makes it difficult for the young fellas to hold a decent conversation...
speaker4: well, i was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when i happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' i said to myself, mcmurphy, i said, that place would make a great second day room. a sort of game room for the young fellas. whadaya think, doc?
speaker5: it is worth considering... miss ratched?
speaker1: the point is well taken, doctor, but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day room?
speaker5: well, since it will be largely the chronics who remain here, one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might occur. what do you think, men, is it workable?
speaker3: right, doc. it's workable.
speaker5: fine!
speaker1: good. good. yes, yes, i think we should give it a trial period. so! may we get back to mister harding's problem... yes, mister mcmurphy?
speaker4: i'm not finished yet.
speaker1: go on...
speaker4: 'kay, item two. tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. tomorrow is the opening game of the world series an' what i want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
speaker1: just a minute, mister mcmurphy!
speaker4: yeah?
speaker1: please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
speaker4: the with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. what i want is a vote on it right now!
speaker3: i second the motion!
speaker4: atta boy, cheswick!
speaker1: very well! all those in favor, please raise your hands.
speaker4: okay, raise your hands.
speaker4: come on', what is this crap? who wants to watch the world series? martini and scanlon's hands go up. several acutes look at them. scanlon and martini's hands go down.
speaker1: i count only two, including you, mister mcmurphy. certainly not enough to change ward policy.
speaker1: yes. now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, mister mcmurphy?
speaker4: no way.
speaker3: no way.

speaker2: come on, doc, you know as well as i do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
speaker1: yes, well, miss ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
speaker2: shoot, doc, the only one i'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. that's all.
speaker1: yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
speaker2: come on, doc, you must be kiddin'.
speaker1: i'm afraid not.
speaker2: that old nurse sure wants my in a sling, don't she!
speaker1: no, mister mcmurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at pendleton.
speaker2: guidance and assistance! that's insane! doc, ya gotta help me.
speaker1: i'm sorry, but i can't keep you here.
speaker2: when?

speaker2: so why are you talking to him?
speaker1: i'm not talkin' to him! i'm talkin' to myself! it helps me think!
