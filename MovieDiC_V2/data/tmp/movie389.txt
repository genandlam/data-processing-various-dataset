speaker1: this is harvey milk speaking on friday november 18th. this is to be played only in the event of my death by assassination... 
speaker1: during one of the early campaigns, i started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my signature...

speaker1: as president of the board of supervisors, it's my duty to make this announcement. both mayor moscone and supervisor harvey milk have been shot... and killed. 
speaker1: police are looking for a suspect...

speaker1: hey. i'm harvey. 
speaker2: okay, harvey...
speaker1: today's my birthday. no, today is actually my birthday.
speaker2: really?

speaker1: and, believe it or not, i don't have any plans. people took me out after work... 
speaker2: work? so, that would be... let me guess. ma bell or atandt.
speaker1: the great american insurance company. i'm part of the big, evil, corporate establishment that, let me guess, you think is the cause of every evil thing in the world from vietnam to diaper rash.
speaker2: you left out bad breath.
speaker1: so... you're not going to let me celebrate my birthday all by myself are you?
speaker2: listen, harvey, you're kind of cute for a suit... but i don't do guys over forty.
speaker1: well then, i'm in luck.
speaker2: how's that?
speaker1: because i'm still thirty-nine... and it's only eleven-fifteen.

speaker1: where are you from? 
speaker2: jackson, mississippi.
speaker1: well, this isn't jackson, but you still can't respond to every strange man you meet on a subway platform. it's too dangerous.
speaker2: now you tell me.
speaker1: there's nothing tougher than a new york city cop. they're arrogant, and they're everywhere. i'll show you the cruising spots, if you want, if you promise you'll be careful... little scottie-san.
speaker2: are you on uppers or what?
speaker1: no. this is just... plain old me.
speaker2: you're afraid of the cops?
speaker1: i'm just discreet. i know a lot of people here. if they found out, i could lose my job.
speaker2: oh. you're one of "those." i think you need a change of scenery. new friends.

speaker1: i need a change. 
speaker2: you're forty now.
speaker1: forty years old and i haven't done a thing i'm proud of.
speaker2: you keep eating like this and you'll be a fat by fifty.
speaker1: an idea, half-jokingly,
speaker3: why don't we run away together?
speaker2: where to?

speaker1: i cashed my last unemployment check yesterday... 
speaker2: well, i hope you did something useful with it.
speaker1: i bought an ounce of pot. i was just wondering if you had any

speaker1: plans, or thoughts... about us doing something to, you know, bring in an income. 
speaker2: don't move.
speaker1: i suppose i can wait tables.
speaker3: no way. i want you right here with me... did you see place downstairs is for rent?
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: i was thinking we could open a shop together.
speaker1: what kind of shop?
speaker2: one with very little overhead. not too much work... a little one, just like morris and minnie milk of woodmere, new york...

speaker1: just a little to the left... 
speaker1: hello there. i'm harvey milk.
speaker2: you're the new renters?
speaker1: yes. welcome to castro camera.

speaker1: i want to join the, um... what is it? the eureka valley merchant's association. i want to help in any way possible. i'm no interloper. a jew perhaps, but i hope you'll forgive that. 
speaker2: i don't think your application will be approved, mr. milk. this is a family neighborhood. your kind are far more welcome on haight street.
speaker1: what "kind" do you mean, sir?
speaker2: the merchant's association will have the police pull your license if you open your doors.
speaker3: based on what law?
speaker2: there's man's law and there's law in this neighborhood and in this city. the san francisco police force is happy to enforce either.
speaker1: thanks for the warm welcome to the neighborhood!
speaker3: we pay taxes you know!

speaker1: we'll form our own business association! start with the gay- owned businesses... we'll take down the addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film. we'll ask them what they want to see done here... what they want changed... we'll get money rolling into this neighborhood. revitalize it... 
speaker2: can i come in now?
speaker1: one more minute! i'll go to the neighborhood banks.
speaker2: harvey. what's with all this political activist crap? i thought you were a republican.
speaker1: i'm a businessman, scott. i think businesses ought to treat their customers right. even their gay customers. for sake, this is san francisco!
speaker2: harvey. it's just like every other city in this country. people hate us. big surprise.
speaker1: we should have at least one block in one city right? start there and take over the neighborhood. okay, you can come in now!
speaker2: wow. this is--

speaker1: thanks for the party, mr. milk! 
speaker2: thanks for joining the castro village association!
speaker2: excuse me gentleman... ladies. hello! mr. mcconnelly!
speaker2: i just wanted to stop in and see how business was doing.
speaker3: fine.
speaker2: so you don't mind all these homosexuals in here, do you?

speaker1: there was danny niccoletta, a cute art student who i'd picked up at toad hall. turns out he was also good at running the camera shop... something scott and i found we had surprising little interest in... 
speaker2: opera is passe, harvey. it's about street theater, now.
speaker1: what you're not getting is the spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions...

speaker1: jim rivaldo. a great mind. a great wit. a harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the castro... including himself. 
speaker1: and somewhere along the line jim picked up a protege, a cute political kid from wisconsin... pabich... and of course there was dennis peron, who ran a very popular business with the new kids...
speaker1: and on occasion we actually had a real customer. but only occasionally.
speaker2: harvey... this guy wants to talk to you.
speaker1: welcome. what can we do for you?
speaker3: hi, i'm allan baird. teamsters representative, and director of the coors beer boycott in california.
speaker1: everyone, this is allan baird. he's a very big deal, so behave yourselves.
speaker3: i was told you were like the mayor of the castro, said you organized the cva, you might know some people in the bars.

speaker1: i do have friends in awfully low places, but just so you know, it's not official yet. 
speaker2: what's that?
speaker1: the mayor part. i've considered gathering an army of queers to march up to city hall and secede, but so far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans. but if i could be of any use, i'm all ears!
speaker2: we can't get coors to go union. these guys are like me, they can't be out of work too long.
speaker1: i'm just curious. are we your first stop or your last?
speaker2: it's been a tough one, mr. milk.
speaker1: well, you seem to have noticed that my kind of people drink a lot of beer. if we're going to fast for your sake, i think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this fight, don't you?
speaker2: is that what you really want?
speaker1: and allies. i'll have coors out of every bar in the castro by the end of the week. deal?
speaker2: thank you mr. milk.

speaker1: no more coors beer. it's gotta come out of every bar. gay and straight. 
speaker2: what's he giving you?
speaker1: nothing for me. that's a convert.
speaker2: a convert to what?
speaker1: the cause.

speaker1: a young gay man runs into the store. 
speaker2: the cops, man, they're up on castro street! toad hall.

speaker1: ...if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them, the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests-- 
speaker2: you're gonna run for supervisor, is that the idea?
speaker1: i could go right for mayor, but i think i should work my way up to it... you'll be my campaign manager.

speaker1: because i have so much experience in politics. 
speaker2: politics is theater. it doesn't matter if you win. you make a statement. you say, "i'm here, pay attention to me."
speaker1: harvey, you do that every time you cross the street.
speaker2: coors looks like it might cave. the union boys will owe me. imagine if we get their vote... it'll be fun!
speaker1: fun?
speaker2: we'll make it a spectacle.

speaker1: school supplies, seniors, not what books i read-- 
speaker1: my fellow degenerates, i would like to announce my candidacy for san francisco city supervisor!

speaker1: public dental care for retired people... legalize pot, vote milk. 
speaker1: hey, i like the way your pants fit... where are you from, kid?
speaker2: sorry old man, not interested.
speaker1: where's home?
speaker2: phoenix.
speaker1: i'm harvey milk. i'm running for supervisor. what's your name?

speaker1: cleve... jones. 
speaker2: well mr. jones, we should walk up to my camera shop and register you.
speaker1: that. elections of any kind are a bourgeois affectation.
speaker2: is that right? do you trick up on polk street?
speaker1: if i need the cash... but i'm selective about my clients.
speaker2: tell me one thing before you get back to work then. what was it like to be a little queer in phoenix?
speaker1: i faked a lung disease to get out of pe. so what? what are you, some kind of street shrink?
speaker2: sometimes. but what i'm saying is, phoenix can change. but we have to start with our street: rent control, police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.
speaker1: well, good luck with all that.
speaker2: you know what i think, cleve jones?
speaker1: that you're gonna get somewhere if you keep talking?
speaker2: no. that you need to do what you're good at. be a prick. fight city hall. fight the cops. fight the people who made you come here to do what you do.

speaker1: sorry old man, i'm leaving for spain tomorrow. europe. got all the cash i need in my back pocket. 
speaker2: i didn't come out until very late in life. there was nobody to--

speaker1: the ã¢â€âœfruitã¢â€â was walking home with his ã¢â€âœtrickã¢â€â when they were jumped. 
speaker1: name's robert hillsborough. did you know him?
speaker2: he used to come into my shop. are there any witnesses?
speaker1: just the "trick." jerry taylor.
speaker2: jerry wasn't a trick. they were lovers.
speaker1: call it what you will. he's our only witness and he says he can't identify the attackers.

speaker1: there'd be a dozen witnesses if they thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe. 
speaker2: you're the mayor of castro street now, right harvey? you really wanna help? get your people to show some discretion on the streets, huh?

speaker1: well, it looks like the big guns and the rich gays in san francisco are going to back dianne feinstein and other straight candidates they consider "gay-friendly." 
speaker2: who cares about those old queens?
speaker3: why isn't my campaign manager leading the meeting?
speaker2: i'm beat, harvey. i passed out flyers for seven hours straight.
speaker3: in the bathhouse?
speaker2: people in bathhouses vote. i'm tired. i'm taking a nap.

speaker1: just checking the exposure. that a new boyfriend? he's very cute. 
speaker2: um... thanks, harvey.
speaker1: so who are these so-called "gay leaders?" and who appointed them? and what are you suggesting, jim, that i'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement? past harvey we see a grandmotherly volunteer, thelma, opening the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and approaching harvey.

speaker1: we're down here, on the streets, trying to help people, so where they are they? 
speaker2: david goodstein is the publisher of the advocate and he has a house--
speaker3: a mansion--
speaker2: --in atherton.
speaker4: harvey, you should read this.
speaker5: "harvey milk will have a dream journey and nightmare to hell, a night of horror. you will be stabbed and have your genitals, cock, balls, cut off."

speaker1: i'm calling the police. 
speaker2: they probably wrote it. hey, if somebody tries to kill me, i'll get the sympathy vote, right?
speaker1: you think this is funny? look at it.
speaker2: it's a complete joke. no rhythm. no humor. it's insulting.
speaker1: don't do that.
speaker2: if you put it away, hide it in a drawer, it'll just get bigger and scarier. now it's there. we'll see it every day. it can't get us.
speaker1: all this energy... to make yourself a target. and what for? something we have no chance to win.
speaker2: i keep telling you, it's not just about winning.

speaker1: i worked for a financial institution. i was very discreet. but someone spotted me at the opera, sitting in a box, next to my lover. and i was fired. that's when i decided to do something. so i bought the advocate. and i use my money and my influence in quiet ways, to do what i can... 
speaker2: endorsing straight candidates is what you think is best to help us?
speaker1: yes, if they're friendly to our cause.
speaker3: politics is complicated in san francisco, and supervisor is a citywide office. political alliances need to be built. you can't simply move here from across the country and run for office.
speaker2: but i am running for office. i'm on the ballot. i have the union rank and file, the seniors, and i could use your magazine's endorsement.

speaker1: harvey, we're like the catholic church. we welcome converts, but we don't make them pope the same day. 
speaker2: and why haven't you run?
speaker1: it's too early for a gay candidate for supervisor. especially one from the castro. it's bad for the community's image.
speaker3: what's wrong with the castro?
speaker1: nobody works there. it's all and drugs and more and no one taking responsibility for their own problems.
speaker2: the cops come into our neighborhood and beat us. they turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered.
speaker4: then we file a lawsuit against the city. we go to our political allies in city hall...
speaker2: there are no real gay allies. yes, our friends may sense our struggle, but they can't feel it. it's not life or death for them. we need our own in office.
speaker4: you can't demand acceptance overnight.
speaker2: why not? how can we ask them to respect us if we don't show ourselves some self respect, david.

speaker1: the more ã¢â€âœoutã¢â€â you make us, the more you incite them. step back and quiet down. 
speaker2: go back into the closet? is that what you're saying? because i know the closet. i lived in it for more years than i care to remember. i don't need your endorsement. i'm not asking anyone for acceptance.
speaker1: for you, politics is a game, a lark. like putting on a rock festival or staging a "love-in." you're too old to be a hippie, harvey milk!
speaker2: i'm not a candidate, i'm part of a movement. the movement is the candidate. there's a difference. you don't see the difference. but i do.
speaker3: thanks for the swim. i'm sorry i in your pool.

speaker1: no. not cute. the shoes are hideous and i hate your hair. you're not fooling anybody. 
speaker2: i'm not gonna let the pacific heights biddies write me off again because of a ponytail. i like it.
speaker2: cabaret? for two? lily, is this from one of my kind?
speaker3: no, no. you won't run into the owner. he died in that suit.
speaker1: this isn't sexy, harvey.
speaker2: too bad. no more pot, no more bath houses for me and little poo.

speaker1: it's a racket. it's 1976 and you still have to be straight, white, catholic and male to get into the san francisco police force. it's racist. homophobic. 
speaker2: how many people do you consider enemies, harvey? i've counted five already.
speaker1: you're right, art. and many are your closest friends. you see, i don't think state assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the democrat machine. machines operate on oil and grease. they're dirty, dehumanizing, and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator.
speaker2: mr. milk, i've worked for years as a social worker in this city. i know sacramento. i know how to get done what we all need done there.
speaker1: tell me mr. agnos... right here in the castro, robert hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner. stabbed,

speaker1: you know harv', your whole rap's a real downer. 
speaker2: my you're handsome up close. i can't tell you how much i'm looking forward to licking you... in the polls.
speaker1: you talk a lot about what you're against. what are you for? in this town, you gotta give em' a reason for optimism or you're cooked.

speaker1: harvey. dinner. 
speaker2: ... get some union boys in the audience, they love me...
speaker3: i can't control who's in the audience...
speaker1: harvey, you need to eat something.

speaker1: scott steps back into the kitchen. 
speaker2: ladies and gentlemen. our apartment is officially off limits.
speaker2: downstairs. time to go. go. out!
speaker2: don't say anything.
speaker2: sit down and eat.

speaker1: if you say one thing about politics or your campaign or where you're speaking tonight or whose endorsement you need... i'll stab you with my fork i swear to 
speaker2: i just wanted to say... this is the most delicious meal i've ever eaten in my entire life.
speaker3: if we lose this one, it'll be just me and you again. i promise.

speaker1: you staying up with me? 
speaker2: the election's tomorrow. i won't sleep... was he good looking?
speaker1: no. he was hideous.
speaker2: hard to tell what's worse. with me, my boyfriends usually find better looking ones to cheat with.
speaker1: i thought we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
speaker2: guess what, cleve jones.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: you're going to meet the most extraordinary men, the sexiest, brightest, funniest men, and you're going to fall in love with so many of them, and you won't know until

speaker1: the end of your life who your greatest friends were or your greatest love was. 
speaker2: is that supposed to help?
speaker1: maybe a little. or not.
speaker2: i went to spain last month... long story. in barcelona, there was this memorial march for gay people who died under franco. the police tried to break it up. it started a riot. a bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp, his wig flew off, but he kept fighting. there was blood literally running in the gutter.
speaker1: we could have a revolution here too. but you can't just use the castro to cruise. you gotta fight.
speaker2: you think you'll win?
speaker1: winning isn't my strong suit.
speaker2: well, i don't "do" losing. ever. maybe i should run for office, and you can work for me. if you can do it, i can do it.
speaker1: can you assemble a thousand people in an hour?
speaker2: yeah, sure.
speaker1: all right, if i run again, you're my man.
speaker2: if...?

speaker1: "come to the florida sunshine tree, great tasting orange juice naturally, orange juice with lots of vitamin c, from the florida sunshine tree." 
speaker2: we lost, but we lost by less! more votes than ever... i remember when that used to work. i want to show you something. this is remarkable.
speaker2: the red is where you did best tonight. if we can get the initiative on district elections to pass, and we can -- we can -- our new supervisor's district will go right up market. right around the castro.

speaker1: the district jim outlines is all bright red. 
speaker2: if you run for supervisor with this new district, it's a potential landslide. you'll be the first up- front gay man elected to major office in the u.s.
speaker3: i don't know if i have another one in me. or scott.

speaker1: gays can't reproduce, so they must recruit young people into their lifestyle... 
speaker2: bryant, a spokeswoman for the orange juice industry, vowed to

speaker1: bring her campaign to the rest of the country... 
speaker2: scottie?
speaker3: i'm sorry sir. i um... i read about you in the paper.
speaker2: i'm sorry. i can't talk right--
speaker3: sir, i think i want to kill myself.
speaker2: no. you don't want to do that.
speaker2: where do you live?
speaker3: in minnesota.
speaker2: you saw me in a paper in minnesota?
speaker3: my folks are taking me to this place tomorrow. a hospital. to fix me.
speaker2: there's nothing wrong with you. listen to me. you don't have to hurt yourself, okay? are you there? here's what you have to do. are you listening?
speaker3: yes.
speaker2: get on a bus. go to the next biggest city. new york, san francisco, la, or even minneapolis. it doesn't matter. just leave. you won't be alone. there are people out here just like you who will welcome you and love you.

speaker1: you're not sick. you're not wrong. 
speaker2: i can't.
speaker1: yes. you can. just get on a bus.
speaker2: i can't... i can't walk, sir. i'm in a wheelchair... sir. are you there?
speaker1: that's okay. it's going to be okay.
speaker3: harvey, you better come down. there's gonna be a riot.

speaker1: if you can't control em', we will. 
speaker2: give me permission to march them.
speaker1: where?
speaker2: anywhere.

speaker1: i know you are angry. i am angry. follow me through the streets of san francisco to share our anger! 
speaker1: are they following in back?
speaker2: yes. where are we going?
speaker1: i don't know.
speaker3: they're still too hot in back.
speaker1: help me turn them up van ness.

speaker1: my name is harvey milk... and i want to recruit you. 
speaker1: i am here tonight to say, we will no longer sit quietly in our closets. we must fight. not just in the castro, or san francisco, but everywhere the anitas go. anita bryant did not win tonight. anita bryant has brought us together... she is going to create a national gay force! and the young people in richmond, minnesota, or jackson, mississippi, or woodmere, new york... who are coming out and hearing anita bryant on television telling them that they're wrong, they're sick, that there is no place for them in this great country, in this world... they're looking to us for something tonight... and i say, we have to give them hope!

speaker1: better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great... 
speaker2: harvey speaks to a hall filled with teamsters.
speaker1: hope for the worker who awakens from the american dream to find that all the jobs have left the country... we gotta give em' hope!

speaker1: evelyn lear's in town, at the opera house in tannhauser. 
speaker2: clearly.
speaker1: what if she strolls into the castro for a cocktail? just one more. we can't let rick stokes take it.
speaker2: let rick have it. nobody thinks you're a fraud here, harvey. you're not in new york, you're not a closet case anymore. people respect you here. relax for a year.
speaker1: if people are ever going to take me seriously, i have to win this one.
speaker2: since when did you care if anyone took you seriously?
speaker1: anita wants to put us all back in concentration camps. rick stokes is too weak to beat her back if she gets to california. i have to be in office to protect us from them.

speaker1: i can't do another one. i'll be back for my sheets. if you're not here, i'll see you in the shop next week. 
speaker2: if you leave me right now... i can find someone new.
speaker1: i know. you're a catch.

speaker1: --ring out the old, ring in the new. this is over. done. i don't want to see anything that say's assembly. this three-time loser is running for supervisor it! 
speaker2: who the heck is she?
speaker1: our new campaign manager. she called last week to volunteer and i asked her to help.
speaker3: help or take over? what about scott?
speaker1: we need new blood.

speaker1: guys... anne kronenberg. she's a woman... a woman who likes women. odd, isn't it? 
speaker2: hi guys. mr. milk... rick stokes isn't pulling out. he's officially filed to run against you. my friend at the advocate says david goodstein is backing him.
speaker3: a gay candidate against a gay candidate. it's unfortunate.
speaker4: they'll split the gay vote. the straights will divide and conquer.
speaker1: try to find out when they're going to announce.
speaker5: you replaced scott with a lesbian?
speaker1: anne worked on a recycling campaign up north. she's very organized.
speaker4: how do you know she's not a plant from rick stokes' campaign?
speaker2: are you guys always this paranoid?
speaker3: yes. they take after harvey.
speaker1: shouldn't you be doing someone's laundry?
speaker3: right after you redecorate my house.
speaker2: sir, my girlfriends say you guys don't like women. just asking, is there a place for us in all this, or are you scared of girls?

speaker1: gentleman, we already have a tinker bell, a lotus-blossom, jim and in your three-piece suits. we need someone to manage things. a woman this time. she's the right price, and she has bigger than any of you. 
speaker2: just give me whatever's left over in the register at the end of the day. so should i call the chronicle about getting us an endorsement? no?

speaker1: young lady, you must be confused. 
speaker2: no, sir. i'm harvey's new campaign manager. anne kronenberg.
speaker1: then you should know this race is for district 5, the castro, not for all of your lesbian... compadres--
speaker2: i'm sorry. are we distracting you, mr. stokes? i'd hate to screw you up on your big night.
speaker3: hi rick, handsome suit. annie, do you have any more hand cards?

speaker1: these people are not from this area. they need to leave. now. 
speaker2: not true. guess where we found them all, rick? a slew of them. way up on valencia street. living right there in our district. and you see, as it turns out, annie here is very, very popular with the ladies.

speaker1: they've accused me of many things, but never as blatant a lie as this. 
speaker2: first ever newspaper endorsement.
speaker3: they endorsed you for being a good businessman? has scott read this?
speaker1: yeah? go show him.

speaker1: cleve, maybe you should go find a boy to celebrate with. just in case. 
speaker2: i'm going to the stud. meet me out.
speaker3: gonna win this time, milk?
speaker4: you're more handsome in the posters.
speaker1: thank you. where do you live?
speaker4: ...palomino's are my favorite horse. they're smart. they're fast and compact. do you think i'm more like a palomino or a stallion?

speaker1: my father beat me when he found out... so i came here. i stay in this man's house. but i don't like him. 
speaker2: shh, it's okay, now. no one's ever going to beat you again.
speaker1: i love you.
speaker2: do you even remember my name? harvey.
speaker1: i love you, harvey.

speaker1: i'm sorry. we're all full. 
speaker2: harvey! harvey!
speaker3: it's too crowded. sorry!
speaker4: harvey!
speaker3: scottie--?
speaker1: the new mrs. milk. i give it a week.
speaker4: harvey, is this all for you? are you this famous?
speaker3: no, darling. we do this all the time. do you like it?
speaker5: carol ruth silver... gordon lau... it's the most liberal board in years!
speaker3: what about dan white? did he win?
speaker5: we'll deal with him tomorrow.

speaker1: does this mean, as many straights are concerned, maybe the gays are taking over san francisco? are you going to be a supervisor for all the people? 
speaker2: i have to be. that's what i was elected for. i have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of all people, all their problems, the problems that effect this city effect all of us. thank you san francisco! thank you!

speaker1: i, harvey milk, do solemnly swear that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states and the constitution of the state of california against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and that i will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which i am about to enter and during such time as i hold the office of supervisor, city and county of san francisco. 
speaker1: anita bryant said gay people brought the drought to california. looks to me like it's finally started raining!

speaker1: this will be the first time in many years that we've seen so many new faces on the board of supervisors. do you think such diversity will cripple the board? 
speaker2: the name of the game on the board is six votes to get anything passed. so, like it or not, dan and i are now in bed together... politically speaking.
speaker3: i've assured harvey here that my brochure's comments about "social deviants" referred more to junkies than to his people. see, i'm about to have my first child. i have to make sure this city remains a decent place to raise him.

speaker1: how long were you a fireman, dan? 
speaker2: a couple of years.
speaker1: and before that... you were a police officer?
speaker2: you have something against cops?
speaker1: no. they tend to have something against me.

speaker1: but firefighters. now those are true heroes... they supported me in the last campaign. i support them fully. 
speaker2: i appreciate it.
speaker1: i meant what i said. i'd like to work together.
speaker2: i'll see you at the office, mr.

speaker1: what do you think of my new theater? 
speaker2: a bit over the top.
speaker1: what's with the suit?
speaker2: i got it from a friend.
speaker1: when you come here, i want you to wear the tightest jeans possible. never blend in. and no elevators. ever. always take the stairs, you can make such a grand entrance going up the stairs.

speaker1: all that. it bugs the out of her. 
speaker1: morning annie, let's set cleve up on mail.
speaker2: will do.
speaker1: come into my office...

speaker1: the first order of business that will come out of this office is a city wide gay rights ordinance. just like the one anita shot down in dade county. what do you think, lotus blossom? 
speaker2: i think it's good. not great.
speaker1: then make it brilliant. i want anita's attention here. in san francisco. i want her to bring her fight to us... this bill needs a unanimous vote. we need headlines.
speaker3: dan white won't vote for this.
speaker1: dan's fine. he's just uneducated. we can teach him.
speaker4: harvey, committee meets at 9:30. oh, hi michael, jim. hey, did you get the invitation to

speaker1: my son's christening? i invited a few of the other supes as well. 
speaker2: i'll be there.
speaker1: great!
speaker3: are you going?
speaker2: hey. i'll let him christen me, if he'll vote for my gay rights ordinance. we need allies. we need everyone.

speaker1: jack? 
speaker2: welcome home, harvey! i hope you're hungry. i only know how to cook one thing, but i make it good.
speaker1: did you... break in?
speaker2: i asked the boy downstairs to let me in...
speaker1: danny?

speaker1: he wouldn't let me in. so i came in this way. your friends aren't very nice to me. 
speaker2: i have a town hall meeting tonight, jack.
speaker1: you work too hard. i'm sorry about your window. i'll fix it tomorrow. are you surprised?!
speaker3: jack, i have to go. i have an invitation to a party tomorrow. lots of rich people, politicians. we could get all dressed up...
speaker1: so i could be the first lady?
speaker3: uh-huh.
speaker1: i watched tv here today. all day. i saw all my children. they killed margo. i knew it was going to happen. they try and trick you but it never works.
speaker3: you always see it coming?
speaker1: what? killing the blonde? every time. i'm good with that. i think now the old lady is going to have an affair. then she'll get killed or married. always one or the other. dead or married.

speaker1: if i make you a key, you won't break my windows again, right? 
speaker2: that's right.

speaker1: harvey and dan have pulled themselves away. 
speaker2: i'm proposing a citywide ordinance. it ensures that a person who already has a job can't be fired for their orientation.
speaker3: i'm not sure my constituents would favor that.
speaker2: is anyone else here from the board?
speaker3: you're the only one who showed up i think.
speaker2: were you christened here?
speaker3: yes. right here. same parish. my grandma immigrated here when this was an irish catholic city. the city of st. francis... a lot's changed here since then.
speaker2: you're more like one of us now...

speaker1: you're not like most homosexuals, are you, harvey? 
speaker2: do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"
speaker1: say, where do you stand on the psychiatric center the city's been pushing into my district?
speaker2: well, i'd have to study it...
speaker1: getting it out of my district was a key piece of my platform. it only attracts arsonist, rapists, all that, you know.
speaker2: sure, sure. a campaign promise.
speaker1: a big one.
speaker1: what do you say we watch out for each other's interests? i'd like that.
speaker2: i'd like that, too, dan.
speaker1: i'm sorry. slipped into some shop talk.
speaker2: the gay rights ordinance. my fault.
speaker3: seems an inappropriate subject in here don't you think?
speaker2: hey, don't knock it till you've tried it.

speaker1: supervisors silver and lau are asking you to vote to keep this psychiatric center in dan's district. it'll go down 6 to 5 if you vote to get rid of it. 
speaker2: it's a youth campus, harvey. these are kids that would be displaced from their families if it's moved.
speaker3: i can't just dump dan. the guy's got nothing going for him. no friends...
speaker4: here we go, harvey to the rescue. isn't it enough we have to put up with jack?
speaker3: lay off. he registered 120 voters last week.
speaker4: so do any of your volunteers, but you don't make them all first lady.
speaker2: what does dan white do for you?
speaker3: he intrigues me... i think he may be one of us.
speaker4: dear say it ain't so!
speaker3: it's just a theory...
speaker1: you just think he's cute.

speaker1: no... i know what it's like to live that life. that lie. you can see it in dan's eyes... the fear, the pressure... 
speaker1: good or bad?
speaker2: not great. state senator john briggs is anita bryant's go-to guy in california for sure. he's filed his petition for a statewide referendum to fire all gay teachers and anyone who supports them.
speaker1: how many signatures will he need to qualify for the ballot?
speaker3: whatever. he can get them in two sundays at church in orange county.
speaker1: this means the fight's coming here, where we can do something about it! wichita's one thing, kansas city. but anita's heading for san francisco! she's not going to know what hit her. smile, children! this is the fight we've been waiting for.

speaker1: do it in our public schools. it's time to root them out. 
speaker2: and how are you going to determine who's a homosexual?
speaker1: sir, my bill outlines procedures for identifying homosexuals.
speaker3: how? will you be sucking them off?
speaker1: sir, you can argue with me, but you cannot argue with

speaker1: oh harvey... your boyfriend is in the closet. 
speaker2: excuse me, david?
speaker3: the latino, he's locked himself in the coat room... mr. milk, phil burton is here. he's likely the next speaker of the house and a much needed ally against prop six.

speaker1: you're right, i know, i was late by twenty minutes. i'm sorry, jack. 
speaker2: who were you with? scott? some boy?
speaker1: i was at work. come out, sugar pea.
speaker2: no. you embarrassed me. i didn't know anyone. these are not good people. i don't want to be here.
speaker1: then go home, jack.
speaker2: no. i'll wait for you. go away.

speaker1: the briggs initiative is polling at 75 percent for approval statewide. 
speaker2: 80 percent in other polls. some even have us losing san francisco.

speaker1: so it's important we not deceive people into thinking we can beat this, or we'll have riots and only increase this backlash. 
speaker2: good point, david. let's just roll right over. make it easier for briggs to us up the ass.
speaker3: we're taking this very seriously in my office. we want to send one of these to every home in california.
speaker4: "proposition six is an affront to human rights. an invasion of the state into the private lives of california citizens." does it even say the word gay on this thing? anywhere?
speaker1: no harvey, purposefully not.
speaker3: with the heat bearing down on your movement right now, we think it's best to dodge the "gay" bullet. go for the human rights angle.
speaker4: people need to know who's affected. this flier needs at least one old queen on it. why don't you volunteer for that, david?
speaker5: corey wares is an out gay--

speaker1: this is and masturbation. it's a coward's response to a dangerous threat. 
speaker2: i think you should leave.
speaker1: jack, it's time to go. get everyone together. i want young people, women, fresh heads. fighters and organizers, not politicians.
speaker3: what about, s-c-o-t-t?

speaker1: but we can't afford infighting anymore, cleve. we have to bring together every group. even the old school democrats. 
speaker2: is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy, or are we just gonna stare?
speaker2: if we're gonna convince the 90% to give a about us 10%... we have to let 'em know who we are. everybody's coming out. the entire state. no matter where they live.
speaker3: "come out, come out, wherever you are!"
speaker2: i'm serious. we're going to tell everyone in the state to come out. every gay doctor, lawyer, teacher, dog catcher... we have to leave the ghetto, let all those people out there know that they do know one of us. and if people won't step out of the closet, we open the door for them.
speaker4: 
speaker5: the whole state is not san francisco.
speaker2: clearly, scott.
speaker1: it could be dangerous. there is such a thing as a right to privacy.

speaker1: privacy's our enemy. you want real political power? let's tell the truth for a change. starting here. if there's anybody in this room, right now, who hasn't told their families, their friends, their employers... do it. now. 
speaker2: my folks know already.
speaker3: i haven't told my father yet...
speaker1: people vote two to one for us if they know just one of us.
speaker1: cleve, show where you keep your phone.
speaker4: it's in the bedroom.

speaker1: i thought you were done with politics. 
speaker2: politics. not the movement. what the was that in there?
speaker1: the movement needs people to be up- front. why were you fighting me?
speaker2: you were the biggest closet case alive in new york. you told me and all your boyfriends to keep our

speaker1: traps shut. you were the hypocrite in there. 
speaker2: my parents are gone. my brother knows. i'm sure they knew.
speaker1: i had to listen to your phone calls home to mom. hear you deny that i existed. you want to be "normal" as bad as any of us. more than any of us... those are kids in there. you're asking them to lose their families.
speaker2: if their families won't love them for who they are, who they really are, then they should lose them.
speaker1: that's insane.
speaker2: who's he? do you live together?
speaker1: someone i'm seeing. he's good for me. he makes me stay home at nights, out of the bars...
speaker2: i miss you.
speaker1: oh, harvey, don't... what's that about?
speaker3: har-veyyyyy!
speaker2: he needs me.

speaker1: --i want it noted that i never promised to back moving any mental health centers. i greatly respect supervisor white, but i would like his remarks stricken. 
speaker2: duly noted. we will take a recess before recording the vote.
speaker3: thank you, harvey.
speaker4: can i have a moment with harvey? alone, please, carol?
speaker4: why are you turning on me like this at the last minute? what did i do?
speaker1: i didn't have all the details. i'll help you craft a different version that doesn't displace any kids.
speaker4: harvey, i can't go back to my family and to my folks and to my district without this. don't do this.
speaker1: i'm getting a lot of pressure, dan.
speaker4: you strung me along. and now you're throwing me to the wolves.

speaker1: you only need one more vote, dan. there are 5 other supervisors you could convince besides me. 
speaker2: i'll vote against your queer law.
speaker1: it'll still pass. you can't keep alienating yourself here, dan.
speaker2: i gave you a chance, harvey. i really did. you blew it. you really blew it.

speaker1: lifting her hand with 
speaker2: on to california!

speaker1: they're moving. i don't know where, but... 
speaker2: did jim call the press? get out there with your camera!
speaker3: i'm going!
speaker1: press is covered. but we don't have a permit to march.
speaker2: when i got coors out of the bars, the union gave me this. i want you to have it.
speaker1: what do i do with this?

speaker1: you're an activist. take it. march them. march those people up to the front doors of city hall. when it looks really bad, the city's first gay supervisor will come out and play peacemaker. we save the city from a riot. we can turn this night into more political power for the cause. 
speaker2: i can't do it like you do it.
speaker1: i won't always be here. somebody else will have to take over. i need you to be the scary one now.

speaker1: forty years ago tonight, the gay citizens of germany found out they no longer had civil rights. tomorrow morning, the gay citizens of wichita will also awaken to find that they too have lost their civil rights. you have whistles. you use them when we have been attacked. tonight we have been attacked. 
speaker1: harvey!
speaker1: get the press to the overpass!

speaker1: cleve gets to the head of the crowd. 
speaker2: move... left... move... left...
speaker3: what are you doing? where's harvey?
speaker2: we're shutting down traffic, both directions.
speaker2: disconnect the power arms!

speaker1: they're calling it a "successful mediation." you're a hero. 
speaker2: lose the note cards next time. your job is just to say into that bullhorn what they're all feeling.
speaker1: you're just jealous it wasn't you out there.
speaker3: we're losing prop six by 60% and you're over there celebrating a riot. i need more visibility... if we're going to beat this thing, we have to get briggs to acknowledge us.
speaker4: every paper's calling prop six the main event now. we lose this, we'll have anti-gay laws in all fifty states, and briggs won't return our calls for a public debate.
speaker5: he's ignoring us to death.
speaker3: we need something populist. what's the number one complaint about city life?
speaker1: the smell in the tenderloin.

speaker1: close. 
speaker2: dog
speaker3: if you cleaned up all the dog in the city, you could be elected mayor.
speaker4: "mayor milk."
speaker1: i like it.

speaker1: supervisor lau? 
speaker2: aye.

speaker1: lau, aye. supervisor silver? 
speaker2: aye.
speaker1: silver, aye. supervisor white?
speaker3: no.
speaker1: white, no. madam president, i have ten ayes and one no.
speaker4: the san francisco gay rights ordinance sponsored by supervisors milk and silver is passed.

speaker1: i can't get my stories on page ten, you're getting page one? 
speaker2: doggy-doo's a real problem, george.
speaker2: powder blue to sign they city's first gay rights law... george, we need your help with briggs... the gay community will have your back from now on. on all issues. i hope you'll have ours.

speaker1: what are you working on, dan? 
speaker2: if you have something to discuss, you can have your aide make an appointment with my aide.
speaker1: listen, i know you're disappointed about the psychiatric center...
speaker2: now you need something from me. you want my me to join in with the queers on this prop six business?
speaker1: we prefer the word "gay," dan. just as i'm sure you prefer the word, "irish-american" to "mick."
speaker2: harvey, our society can't exist without the family, without the church.
speaker1: we're not against those things.
speaker2: you're not? can two men reproduce?
speaker1: no. but, we keep trying!

speaker1: c'mon, dan. you're channeling anita and briggs... we can work together. 
speaker2: okay. you introduce an initiative for supervisor pay raises.
speaker1: it's a bad time politically. i have an election next year.
speaker2: you asked for something. introduce pay raises. i can't take care of my family on our salaries. you don't have that problem, do you?
speaker2: mr. milk, you'll excuse me, i have a development meeting.

speaker1: what's wrong, taco bell? 
speaker2: anne and cleve tried to cut me out of your table. you should fire them.
speaker1: i'll take it under consideration. why don't you get us a drink?
speaker3: don't let cezar chavez hear you calling him taco bell.

speaker1: he's getting better. he's enrolling in classes on monday. 
speaker2: i remember when your birthdays were a bit less... lavish. more intimate.
speaker1: who invited you? anne?
speaker2: my boyfriend got an invitation. i was his "plus one."
speaker1: congratulations. it was a tough ticket to get.
speaker2: congratulations to you. looks like you're part of the machine now. you can do better.
speaker1: when i come home to jack, i don't have to talk politics or talk intelligently. or even talk.
speaker1: and where's an old man like me going to get such a good looking young man, right?
speaker2: you're not so old. you look handsome... happy 48th. looks like you're gonna make it to fifty after- all, mr. milk.

speaker1: sorry i missed the party, harv... 
speaker2: no problem, dan. good to see you.
speaker1: dog poop?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: it's good! it's a good one.
speaker2: thanks. but it's a real problem.
speaker1: oh, yeah. i mean, knows how many problems it causes. all kinds of diseases, birth defects probably, i mean, stuff you can't even... hey, i got you a little something.
speaker2: you didn't have to--
speaker1: you didn't have to--
speaker1: why do people always say that? "you didn't have to?" i mean, of course, right? but, that's what they always say. they always say things like that...
speaker2: are you okay, dan?

speaker1: oh, what? yeah, sure. harvey, i just... i just want to say... happy birthday. 
speaker1: i've really learned a lot from watching you, harvey.
speaker2: i doubt that.
speaker1: no, i have. you gotta get out there. get noticed. that's how it works. but, you have an issue.
speaker2: it's more than an issue, dan. dan. i've had four relationships in my life. three of those four tried to kill themselves. i know it was my fault they did it. i told them to stay quiet. to hide. most of my life i've been closeted. that's what living this life is like for most of us. the way things are... this isn't just about our jobs, or any issue, it's our lives we're fighting for.
speaker1: i've learned a lot from you, harvey. i'm going to get my picture in the papers, too. you'll see. i've got my own issue. that's right. dan white's got an issue!

speaker1: i see naked men walking around, naked women walking around, which doesn't bother me as far as my personal standards of nudity, but it's not proper. we wouldn't allow it for any other parade in san francisco, and it should not be allowed for the gay parade. 
speaker2: it came in the mail today.
speaker3: "you get the first bullet the minute you stand at the microphone." looks like the publicity's working.
speaker2: you don't have to go up there.
speaker3: it could happen any day, any night, any time... the nation's eye is on us. i have to do this.

speaker1: my name is harvey milk, and i want to recruit you. i want to recruit you for the fight to preserve your democracy. brothers and sisters, you must come out. come out to your parents. i know that it is hard and will hurt them but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth! come out to your friends, if they indeed are your friends. come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers. once and for all, break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions. for your sake. for their sake. for the sake of the youngsters who are becoming scared by the votes from dade to eugene. on the statue of liberty it says "give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free." in the declaration of independence it is written "all men are created equal and are endowed with certain inalienable rights." for mr. briggs and mrs. bryant and all the bigots out there, no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase those words from the declaration of independence. no matter how hard you try, you cannot chip those words from off the base of the statue of liberty. that is what america is. love it or leave it. 
speaker2: the mayor says briggs is on his way here. he could intercept him for us. we could get him face to face.
speaker1: get the press.

speaker1: the parade is the other direction. 
speaker2: they're taking us another way, sir.

speaker1: i have a right to be here, mr. mayor. 
speaker2: i'm afraid it's not in the interest of your safety, or my public's safety to let you into that parade grounds.
speaker3: hi, i'm harvey milk. it's quite an honor to meet you, mr. briggs.
speaker1: i'm aware. sad you're too afraid to fight this out in public, mr. milk.
speaker3: no sir. i would love to have a public debate. i'm very interested in the details of your argument.
speaker1: you know the details. as do the people. look at the votes across this nation. the "public" is with me.
speaker3: yes sir, today they are. but with my city's mayor and the san francisco press as my witnesses, i'm challenging you to a public debate.

speaker1: senator, as a christian it's interesting that you don't seem to understand what christ was about. he was about accepting people and giving love, not carrying a bible in one hand and hatred in the other... ...now all the gay myths have been shattered, all the fears, all the-- 
speaker2: not in my mind they haven't--
speaker1: that's it. in your mind they haven't, and i'm wondering why--
speaker2: mr. milk, we don't allow people who believe in practicing to teach our children, and the reason we don't is because it is illegal. but it's not illegal to be a homosexual in california.
speaker1: and your law goes even further. any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired--
speaker2: true. but, gay people don't have children of their own. if they don't recruit our children, they'd all die away. that's why they want to be teachers, to encourage our children to join them.
speaker1: how do you teach homosexuality? like french? i was born of heterosexual parents, i was taught by heterosexual teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society. so then why am i homosexual? and no offense meant, but if it were true that children mimicked their

speaker1: teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around. 
speaker2: briggs makes a statement to the press.
speaker3: if they're going to lead such an open life of homosexuality that they want a 21-gun salute every time somebody goes by them, those people are going to be in danger of being removed their job.
speaker1: we were really genuinely frightened by proposition six, and with the backlash gaining strength, we were very pessimistic. we didn't think there was any chance we could beat it. what we hoped to do was to organize to the point that when we did lose, there would be a revolt... that all would break lose.
speaker4: people are coming out, though. we met with groups in bakersfield, redding, a dozen people showed up in a library basement in fresno asking for our support if they came out. last sunday, the reverend of st. mary's came out to his entire congregation...
speaker1: we're still losing, 60 to 30. we have to take the show on the road. call briggs's office. do a press release. tell them he can pick the town, the audience, and i'll ask our supporters not to attend.

speaker1: their audiences are insanely devout. we'll get killed. 
speaker2: get me orange county.
speaker3: jack is flipping out, storming around the place.
speaker4: you just have to go down to la and guess the right things on tv and they'll pay us... you have to use your fame now while you have it. we could have nice things.
speaker2: i don't have time to do game shows right now...
speaker4: you are horrible! i have worked on this surprise for you for weeks!
speaker2: are you drunk right now?
speaker4: you are an ungrateful asshole!
speaker2: jack, i'll have more time soon.
speaker4: you're ashamed of me!
speaker2: that's not true. i think you're smart. you're capable. no matter what your family or your father said. i believe in you... we should figure out something for you to do. i could get you a job.
speaker4: i'll never be good enough for you!

speaker1: if in your statements here you say that child molestation is not an issue, why do you put out literature that hammers it home, why do you play on that myth and fear? 
speaker2: same thing with vd harvey, we put out publications about vd so you can avoid it.
speaker1: but you've even admitted that there's more molestation in the heterosexual group! so why not get rid of the heterosexual teachers?
speaker2: we are not talking about homos... child molestation, the fact is, at least 95 percent of the people are heterosexual. if we took heterosexuals out and homosexuals out, you know what--
speaker3: --we'd have no teachers we'd have no teachers--
speaker1: --no child molestation... so you're saying the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child molestation?
speaker2: no, no, i'm not saying that at all--

speaker1: that's what you just said. 
speaker2: no. i'm saying that we cannot prevent child molestation so let's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group--
speaker1: --sir, in your own drive for personal power, how many careers are you willing to see destroyed? how many lives will you destroy in your for power, and when will you stop?

speaker1: nothing. i just want to know when you'll be home. 
speaker2: you just had them pull me out of my big vote on the dog ordinance.
speaker1: it's poop, harvey. aren't i more important than poop?
speaker2: yes, but... i don't know when i'll be home. maybe 6. 6:15.
speaker1: fine. 6:15.
speaker2: dan? how's the baby?
speaker3: you didn't bring up supervisor pay raises. in fact, i heard you plan to publicly oppose them.
speaker2: i heard you planned to vote against them too, dan. were you trying to set me up?

speaker1: it's not a good time for me to bring it up. politically. 
speaker2: dan, there's a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement, give me that and i'll consider backing pay raises.
speaker1: i don't trade votes... unlike you, the way i was raised, we believe in right and wrong. moral and immoral.
speaker2: black skin and white in your police department? dan, even ronald reagan's come out against proposition six. you're looking more and more out of touch.
speaker1: if i come out against prop six, it's only for the invasion of state's rights issue.
speaker2: and the potential witch hunts against you "straight people," right?
speaker1: you underestimate me, milk. you're very, very wrong about me.
speaker2: i don't know what you mean.
speaker2: what is it, dan? you can tell me.
speaker1: you don't... you can't humiliate me. and you will not demean me.

speaker1: harvey walks home. a passerby shouts: 
speaker2: you're the that just passed that dog thing aren't you? what the do you have against dogs?
speaker3: sir, blind people can't see "shit." what the heck do you have against blind people?

speaker1: harvey. look at me. look at me. you did everything you could. 
speaker2: no, i didn't. not everything...

speaker1: what else could you have done? 
speaker2: i could have come home at six o'clock, not six-fifteen.
speaker3: "beware. the ides. of november."

speaker1: would you like to trade with me? 
speaker2: no. what the heck are you?
speaker1: oh, me? i'm an elected official. i run this city.

speaker1: san bernadino is coming in. not good. 
speaker2: of course not. how not good?
speaker3: 60% for briggs. same in fresno.
speaker2: dear little lotus blossom.
speaker4: imperial is 69% "for" so far.
speaker2: put it up on the board.
speaker2: the whole world is watching this. this is san francisco we're about to lose. are you ready?
speaker5: i can have 15,000 people in an hour. but there's gonna be riots if this thing passes.
speaker2: there better be.
speaker5: what are you telling me?

speaker1: i can't say it because i'm a public official, but for sake, if this thing passes, fight back. 
speaker2: don amador down in la.
speaker3: kind of a bad time, don.
speaker4: no sir, this is paul. don just gave me the phone.
speaker1: paul who?
speaker4: you talked to me on the phone a year or so ago. i'm from minnesota... i'm in a wheelchair.
speaker1: i thought you were a goner, paul.
speaker4: i'm sorry. i should have called. when i read in the paper that you won the supervisor seat, i got a friend to put me on a bus to la.
speaker1: who did you know in los angeles?
speaker4: nobody. that's the uh... i just didn't want to die anymore, sir. i met your friend don down here. i turned 18. i voted today against prop six... thank you, mr. milk.
speaker1: no. you did this all by yourself.

speaker1: i don't think i'd be alive right now without you, sir. you were right about la. it's like gay disney world. 
speaker2: then you have to see san francisco!
speaker1: okay. i will. don wanted me to um... congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight. congratulations mr. milk.
speaker3: it looks like we've taken la county, harvey. by 65%. it's huge.
speaker2: i gotta go, don. thank you. la by 65% put it up! put it up!
speaker4: the polls were off. briggs is going down by more than 2 to 1. the only district where it's leading in san francisco is dan white's.
speaker2: well cleve, now what are we going to do tonight?! cover up lady liberty. the cameras will be coming our way.

speaker1: to the gay community all over this state... my message to you is... so far a lot of people joined us and rejected proposition six, and now we owe them something... we must destroy the myths once and for all, shatter them. we must continue to speak out... and most importantly, most importantly, every gay person must come out. 
speaker1: tonight... tonight it is clear that everyone out there does know one of us. and now that they do, they see we are not sick... they can feel we are not wrong... and they know we should have a place in this great country and in this world... a message of hope has been to sent to all the young people out there... to all those afraid of this wave of hate... to all those who have lost their homes and their hometowns... tonight we know there is a place for us! my brothers and sisters... we can come home again!

speaker1: what's the matter? 
speaker2: you ever heard of sore losers? well, i'm a sore winner... i thought we were goners.
speaker2: i'd started looking forward to the riots.

speaker1: i told you, i don't "do" losing. 
speaker2: i think maybe we're best with our backs to the wall. it's too quiet. i think we should march on washington d.c. next year.
speaker1: milk, you're a decent politician, a mediocre businessman, but you're a lousy gay man. take some time off. fifty's right around the corner. nobody will want you after that...
speaker2: the people voted for us, cleve jones.
speaker1: they did. there's nowhere to march tonight, mr. harvey milk. lets go back inside.

speaker1: i just resigned. congratulations. i'm sure you're pleased. 
speaker1: you'll be the next president of the board.
speaker2: i'm sure we could work together--
speaker3: hey, dan. just got word. can we talk to you for a minute?
speaker1: sure...
speaker3: downstairs. the association meeting room...

speaker1: --white gave up all of his political chits when he resigned without making any arrangements. 
speaker2: the city of san francisco is in disbelief. four-hundred bodies have been found thus far in jonestown, guyana. leader of the people's temple, jim jones...

speaker1: a man has the right to change his mind. give me some peace. 
speaker2: how many of our propositions has dan shut down? we could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense. cement rent control. it's his vote on this board that stands in our way.
speaker1: i get it, harvey. i've been lobbied all week. enough.
speaker2: let me just remind you that you're up for re-election. if you re- appoint dan, you lose the gay vote. they listen to me. you won't get elected dog catcher.
speaker1: i'll make my decision on monday. you know what you sounded like just now? boss tweed or mayor daly.
speaker2: a "homosexual" with a bit of power... rather scary isn't it, mr. mayor?

speaker1: yes. this is dan white. 
speaker2: i'm barbra taylor from kcbs. i'm interested in your reaction. i've received information from the mayor's office that you won't be getting your job back.
speaker1: i'm sorry. i don't know anything about that.

speaker1: hello? 
speaker2: sorry to wake you up.
speaker1: what's wrong?
speaker2: i went to the opera tonight. guess who my date was.
speaker1: who?
speaker2: bidu sayao herself. she was in the first puccini i ever saw. the crowd went wild. it was like i was young again, seeing my first live opera...
speaker1: if you go to the opera again, you should call me.
speaker2: really?

speaker1: yes. i'd go with you. 
speaker2: i'd like that.
speaker1: harvey?
speaker2: look out the window, the sun's coming up.
speaker1: it's late. you should get some sleep.
speaker2: i don't want to miss it.
speaker1: miss what?
speaker2: this.

speaker1: hey, wait a minute, mr.-- 
speaker2: my aide was supposed to come down here and let me in the side door, but she never showed up.
speaker1: and you are?

speaker1: who's it gonna be? is he replacing dan with that liberal lefty don horanzy? that'll really shake up the board, huh? 
speaker2: all i know is that we're getting a new supervisor today. if dan shows up, just avoid him. we don't need a scene today, right harvey?
speaker1: heaven forbid, dianne.

speaker1: you can't take this away from me! 
speaker2: the issue is what's fair, for the people of your district. take some time off. spend it with your family.

speaker1: this time next year we're marching on washington d.c. it'll look like market and castro, but with a million people. write that down. tell president carter we're coming after him next. i'm going to deposit this. i'll be back in 20 minutes. 
speaker2: say, harve, can i see you for a minute?
speaker1: sure.

speaker1: where is everybody? didn't anyone give a damn? 
speaker2: i ask this... if there should be an assassination, i would hope that five, ten, one hundred, a thousand would rise. i would like to see every gay lawyer, every gay architect come out--

speaker1: --if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door... and that's all. i ask for the movement to continue. because it's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power... it's about the "us's" out there. not only gays, but the blacks, the asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us's. without hope, the us's give up-- 
speaker1: --i know you cannot live on hope alone, but without it, life is not worth living. so you, and you, and you...
