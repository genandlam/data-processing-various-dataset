HARVEY MILK: this is harvey milk speaking on friday november 18th. this is to be played only in the event of my death by assassination... 
HARVEY MILK: during one of the early campaigns, i started opening my speeches with the same line and it sort of became my signature...

DIANNE FEINSTEIN: as president of the board of supervisors, it's my duty to make this announcement. both mayor moscone and supervisor harvey milk have been shot... and killed. 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: police are looking for a suspect...

HARVEY MILK: hey. i'm harvey. 
SCOTT SMITH: okay, harvey...
HARVEY MILK: today's my birthday. no, today is actually my birthday.
SCOTT SMITH: really?

HARVEY MILK: and, believe it or not, i don't have any plans. people took me out after work... 
SCOTT SMITH: work? so, that would be... let me guess. ma bell or atandt.
HARVEY MILK: the great american insurance company. i'm part of the big, evil, corporate establishment that, let me guess, you think is the cause of every evil thing in the world from vietnam to diaper rash.
SCOTT SMITH: you left out bad breath.
HARVEY MILK: so... you're not going to let me celebrate my birthday all by myself are you?
SCOTT SMITH: listen, harvey, you're kind of cute for a suit... but i don't do guys over forty.
HARVEY MILK: well then, i'm in luck.
SCOTT SMITH: how's that?
HARVEY MILK: because i'm still thirty-nine... and it's only eleven-fifteen.

HARVEY MILK: where are you from? 
SCOTT SMITH: jackson, mississippi.
HARVEY MILK: well, this isn't jackson, but you still can't respond to every strange man you meet on a subway platform. it's too dangerous.
SCOTT SMITH: now you tell me.
HARVEY MILK: there's nothing tougher than a new york city cop. they're arrogant, and they're everywhere. i'll show you the cruising spots, if you want, if you promise you'll be careful... little scottie-san.
SCOTT SMITH: are you on uppers or what?
HARVEY MILK: no. this is just... plain old me.
SCOTT SMITH: you're afraid of the cops?
HARVEY MILK: i'm just discreet. i know a lot of people here. if they found out, i could lose my job.
SCOTT SMITH: oh. you're one of "those." i think you need a change of scenery. new friends.

HARVEY MILK: i need a change. 
SCOTT SMITH: you're forty now.
HARVEY MILK: forty years old and i haven't done a thing i'm proud of.
SCOTT SMITH: you keep eating like this and you'll be a fat by fifty.
HARVEY MILK: an idea, half-jokingly,
HALF-SERIOUSLY): why don't we run away together?
SCOTT SMITH: where to?

SCOTT SMITH: i cashed my last unemployment check yesterday... 
HARVEY MILK: well, i hope you did something useful with it.
SCOTT SMITH: i bought an ounce of pot. i was just wondering if you had any

SCOTT SMITH: plans, or thoughts... about us doing something to, you know, bring in an income. 
HARVEY MILK: don't move.
SCOTT SMITH: i suppose i can wait tables.
HARVEY: no way. i want you right here with me... did you see place downstairs is for rent?
SCOTT SMITH: yeah.
HARVEY MILK: i was thinking we could open a shop together.
SCOTT SMITH: what kind of shop?
HARVEY MILK: one with very little overhead. not too much work... a little one, just like morris and minnie milk of woodmere, new york...

HARVEY MILK: just a little to the left... 
HARVEY MILK: hello there. i'm harvey milk.
MCCONNELLY: you're the new renters?
HARVEY MILK: yes. welcome to castro camera.

HARVEY MILK: i want to join the, um... what is it? the eureka valley merchant's association. i want to help in any way possible. i'm no interloper. a jew perhaps, but i hope you'll forgive that. 
MCCONNELLY: i don't think your application will be approved, mr. milk. this is a family neighborhood. your kind are far more welcome on haight street.
HARVEY MILK: what "kind" do you mean, sir?
MCCONNELLY: the merchant's association will have the police pull your license if you open your doors.
SCOTT SMITH: based on what law?
MCCONNELLY: there's man's law and there's law in this neighborhood and in this city. the san francisco police force is happy to enforce either.
HARVEY MILK: thanks for the warm welcome to the neighborhood!
SCOTT SMITH: we pay taxes you know!

HARVEY MILK: we'll form our own business association! start with the gay- owned businesses... we'll take down the addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film. we'll ask them what they want to see done here... what they want changed... we'll get money rolling into this neighborhood. revitalize it... 
SCOTT SMITH: can i come in now?
HARVEY MILK: one more minute! i'll go to the neighborhood banks.
SCOTT SMITH: harvey. what's with all this political activist crap? i thought you were a republican.
HARVEY MILK: i'm a businessman, scott. i think businesses ought to treat their customers right. even their gay customers. for sake, this is san francisco!
SCOTT SMITH: harvey. it's just like every other city in this country. people hate us. big surprise.
HARVEY MILK: we should have at least one block in one city right? start there and take over the neighborhood. okay, you can come in now!
SCOTT SMITH: wow. this is--

MAN ON THE STREET: thanks for the party, mr. milk! 
HARVEY MILK: thanks for joining the castro village association!
HARVEY MILK: excuse me gentleman... ladies. hello! mr. mcconnelly!
HARVEY MILK: i just wanted to stop in and see how business was doing.
MCCONNELLY: fine.
HARVEY MILK: so you don't mind all these homosexuals in here, do you?

HARVEY MILK: there was danny niccoletta, a cute art student who i'd picked up at toad hall. turns out he was also good at running the camera shop... something scott and i found we had surprising little interest in... 
DANNY NICCOLETTA: opera is passe, harvey. it's about street theater, now.
HARVEY MILK: what you're not getting is the spectacle of it, the bigger than life emotions...

HARVEY MILK: jim rivaldo. a great mind. a great wit. a harvard graduate, which nobody cared about, in those days, in the castro... including himself. 
HARVEY MILK: and somewhere along the line jim picked up a protege, a cute political kid from wisconsin... pabich... and of course there was dennis peron, who ran a very popular business with the new kids...
HARVEY MILK: and on occasion we actually had a real customer. but only occasionally.
SCOTT SMITH: harvey... this guy wants to talk to you.
HARVEY MILK: welcome. what can we do for you?
ALLAN BAIRD: hi, i'm allan baird. teamsters representative, and director of the coors beer boycott in california.
HARVEY MILK: everyone, this is allan baird. he's a very big deal, so behave yourselves.
ALLAN BAIRD: i was told you were like the mayor of the castro, said you organized the cva, you might know some people in the bars.

HARVEY MILK: i do have friends in awfully low places, but just so you know, it's not official yet. 
ALLAN BAIRD: what's that?
HARVEY MILK: the mayor part. i've considered gathering an army of queers to march up to city hall and secede, but so far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans. but if i could be of any use, i'm all ears!
ALLAN BAIRD: we can't get coors to go union. these guys are like me, they can't be out of work too long.
HARVEY MILK: i'm just curious. are we your first stop or your last?
ALLAN BAIRD: it's been a tough one, mr. milk.
HARVEY MILK: well, you seem to have noticed that my kind of people drink a lot of beer. if we're going to fast for your sake, i think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this fight, don't you?
ALLAN BAIRD: is that what you really want?
HARVEY MILK: and allies. i'll have coors out of every bar in the castro by the end of the week. deal?
ALLAN BAIRD: thank you mr. milk.

HARVEY MILK: no more coors beer. it's gotta come out of every bar. gay and straight. 
SCOTT SMITH: what's he giving you?
HARVEY MILK: nothing for me. that's a convert.
SCOTT SMITH: a convert to what?
HARVEY MILK: the cause.

16.: a young gay man runs into the store. 
YOUNG GAY MAN: the cops, man, they're up on castro street! toad hall.

HARVEY MILK: ...if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them, the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests-- 
SCOTT SMITH: you're gonna run for supervisor, is that the idea?
HARVEY MILK: i could go right for mayor, but i think i should work my way up to it... you'll be my campaign manager.

SCOTT SMITH: because i have so much experience in politics. 
HARVEY MILK: politics is theater. it doesn't matter if you win. you make a statement. you say, "i'm here, pay attention to me."
SCOTT SMITH: harvey, you do that every time you cross the street.
HARVEY MILK: coors looks like it might cave. the union boys will owe me. imagine if we get their vote... it'll be fun!
SCOTT SMITH: fun?
HARVEY MILK: we'll make it a spectacle.

HARVEY MILK: school supplies, seniors, not what books i read-- 
HARVEY MILK: my fellow degenerates, i would like to announce my candidacy for san francisco city supervisor!

HARVEY MILK: public dental care for retired people... legalize pot, vote milk. 
HARVEY MILK: hey, i like the way your pants fit... where are you from, kid?
CLEVE JONES: sorry old man, not interested.
HARVEY MILK: where's home?
CLEVE JONES: phoenix.
HARVEY MILK: i'm harvey milk. i'm running for supervisor. what's your name?

CLEVE JONES: cleve... jones. 
HARVEY MILK: well mr. jones, we should walk up to my camera shop and register you.
CLEVE JONES: that. elections of any kind are a bourgeois affectation.
HARVEY MILK: is that right? do you trick up on polk street?
CLEVE JONES: if i need the cash... but i'm selective about my clients.
HARVEY MILK: tell me one thing before you get back to work then. what was it like to be a little queer in phoenix?
CLEVE JONES: i faked a lung disease to get out of pe. so what? what are you, some kind of street shrink?
HARVEY MILK: sometimes. but what i'm saying is, phoenix can change. but we have to start with our street: rent control, police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.
CLEVE JONES: well, good luck with all that.
HARVEY MILK: you know what i think, cleve jones?
CLEVE JONES: that you're gonna get somewhere if you keep talking?
HARVEY MILK: no. that you need to do what you're good at. be a prick. fight city hall. fight the cops. fight the people who made you come here to do what you do.

CLEVE JONES: sorry old man, i'm leaving for spain tomorrow. europe. got all the cash i need in my back pocket. 
HARVEY MILK: i didn't come out until very late in life. there was nobody to--

COP: the ã¢â€âœfruitã¢â€â was walking home with his ã¢â€âœtrickã¢â€â when they were jumped. 
COP: name's robert hillsborough. did you know him?
HARVEY MILK: he used to come into my shop. are there any witnesses?
COP: just the "trick." jerry taylor.
HARVEY MILK: jerry wasn't a trick. they were lovers.
COP: call it what you will. he's our only witness and he says he can't identify the attackers.

HARVEY MILK: there'd be a dozen witnesses if they thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe. 
COP: you're the mayor of castro street now, right harvey? you really wanna help? get your people to show some discretion on the streets, huh?

JIM RIVALDO: well, it looks like the big guns and the rich gays in san francisco are going to back dianne feinstein and other straight candidates they consider "gay-friendly." 
SCOTT SMITH: who cares about those old queens?
HARVEY MILK: why isn't my campaign manager leading the meeting?
SCOTT SMITH: i'm beat, harvey. i passed out flyers for seven hours straight.
HARVEY MILK: in the bathhouse?
SCOTT SMITH: people in bathhouses vote. i'm tired. i'm taking a nap.

HARVEY MILK: just checking the exposure. that a new boyfriend? he's very cute. 
CUSTOMER: um... thanks, harvey.
HARVEY MILK: so who are these so-called "gay leaders?" and who appointed them? and what are you suggesting, jim, that i'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement? past harvey we see a grandmotherly volunteer, thelma, opening the mail, casually reading a letter, then rising and approaching harvey.

HARVEY MILK: we're down here, on the streets, trying to help people, so where they are they? 
DICK PABICH: david goodstein is the publisher of the advocate and he has a house--
JIM RIVALDO: a mansion--
DICK PABICH: --in atherton.
THELMA: harvey, you should read this.
SCOTT SMITH: "harvey milk will have a dream journey and nightmare to hell, a night of horror. you will be stabbed and have your genitals, cock, balls, cut off."

SCOTT SMITH: i'm calling the police. 
HARVEY MILK: they probably wrote it. hey, if somebody tries to kill me, i'll get the sympathy vote, right?
SCOTT SMITH: you think this is funny? look at it.
HARVEY MILK: it's a complete joke. no rhythm. no humor. it's insulting.
SCOTT SMITH: don't do that.
HARVEY MILK: if you put it away, hide it in a drawer, it'll just get bigger and scarier. now it's there. we'll see it every day. it can't get us.
SCOTT SMITH: all this energy... to make yourself a target. and what for? something we have no chance to win.
HARVEY MILK: i keep telling you, it's not just about winning.

DAVID GOODSTEIN: i worked for a financial institution. i was very discreet. but someone spotted me at the opera, sitting in a box, next to my lover. and i was fired. that's when i decided to do something. so i bought the advocate. and i use my money and my influence in quiet ways, to do what i can... 
HARVEY MILK: endorsing straight candidates is what you think is best to help us?
DAVID GOODSTEIN: yes, if they're friendly to our cause.
RICK STOKES: politics is complicated in san francisco, and supervisor is a citywide office. political alliances need to be built. you can't simply move here from across the country and run for office.
HARVEY MILK: but i am running for office. i'm on the ballot. i have the union rank and file, the seniors, and i could use your magazine's endorsement.

DAVID GOODSTEIN: harvey, we're like the catholic church. we welcome converts, but we don't make them pope the same day. 
HARVEY MILK: and why haven't you run?
DAVID GOODSTEIN: it's too early for a gay candidate for supervisor. especially one from the castro. it's bad for the community's image.
SCOTT SMITH: what's wrong with the castro?
DAVID GOODSTEIN: nobody works there. it's all and drugs and more and no one taking responsibility for their own problems.
HARVEY MILK: the cops come into our neighborhood and beat us. they turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered.
RICK STOKES: then we file a lawsuit against the city. we go to our political allies in city hall...
HARVEY MILK: there are no real gay allies. yes, our friends may sense our struggle, but they can't feel it. it's not life or death for them. we need our own in office.
RICK STOKES: you can't demand acceptance overnight.
HARVEY MILK: why not? how can we ask them to respect us if we don't show ourselves some self respect, david.

DAVID GOODSTEIN: the more ã¢â€âœoutã¢â€â you make us, the more you incite them. step back and quiet down. 
HARVEY MILK: go back into the closet? is that what you're saying? because i know the closet. i lived in it for more years than i care to remember. i don't need your endorsement. i'm not asking anyone for acceptance.
DAVID GOODSTEIN: for you, politics is a game, a lark. like putting on a rock festival or staging a "love-in." you're too old to be a hippie, harvey milk!
HARVEY MILK: i'm not a candidate, i'm part of a movement. the movement is the candidate. there's a difference. you don't see the difference. but i do.
SCOTT SMITH: thanks for the swim. i'm sorry i in your pool.

SCOTT SMITH: no. not cute. the shoes are hideous and i hate your hair. you're not fooling anybody. 
HARVEY MILK: i'm not gonna let the pacific heights biddies write me off again because of a ponytail. i like it.
HARVEY MILK: cabaret? for two? lily, is this from one of my kind?
LILY: no, no. you won't run into the owner. he died in that suit.
SCOTT SMITH: this isn't sexy, harvey.
HARVEY MILK: too bad. no more pot, no more bath houses for me and little poo.

HARVEY MILK: it's a racket. it's 1976 and you still have to be straight, white, catholic and male to get into the san francisco police force. it's racist. homophobic. 
ART AGNOS: how many people do you consider enemies, harvey? i've counted five already.
HARVEY MILK: you're right, art. and many are your closest friends. you see, i don't think state assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the democrat machine. machines operate on oil and grease. they're dirty, dehumanizing, and too often unresponsive to any needs but those of the operator.
ART AGNOS: mr. milk, i've worked for years as a social worker in this city. i know sacramento. i know how to get done what we all need done there.
HARVEY MILK: tell me mr. agnos... right here in the castro, robert hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner. stabbed,

ART AGNOS: you know harv', your whole rap's a real downer. 
HARVEY MILK: my you're handsome up close. i can't tell you how much i'm looking forward to licking you... in the polls.
ART AGNOS: you talk a lot about what you're against. what are you for? in this town, you gotta give em' a reason for optimism or you're cooked.

SCOTT SMITH: harvey. dinner. 
HARVEY: ... get some union boys in the audience, they love me...
JIM RIVALDO: i can't control who's in the audience...
SCOTT SMITH: harvey, you need to eat something.

30.: scott steps back into the kitchen. 
SCOTT SMITH: ladies and gentlemen. our apartment is officially off limits.
SCOTT SMITH: downstairs. time to go. go. out!
SCOTT SMITH: don't say anything.
SCOTT SMITH: sit down and eat.

SCOTT: if you say one thing about politics or your campaign or where you're speaking tonight or whose endorsement you need... i'll stab you with my fork i swear to 
HARVEY: i just wanted to say... this is the most delicious meal i've ever eaten in my entire life.
HARVEY MILK: if we lose this one, it'll be just me and you again. i promise.

CLEVE JONES: you staying up with me? 
HARVEY MILK: the election's tomorrow. i won't sleep... was he good looking?
CLEVE JONES: no. he was hideous.
HARVEY MILK: hard to tell what's worse. with me, my boyfriends usually find better looking ones to cheat with.
CLEVE JONES: i thought we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
HARVEY MILK: guess what, cleve jones.
CLEVE JONES: what?
HARVEY MILK: you're going to meet the most extraordinary men, the sexiest, brightest, funniest men, and you're going to fall in love with so many of them, and you won't know until

HARVEY MILK: the end of your life who your greatest friends were or your greatest love was. 
CLEVE JONES: is that supposed to help?
HARVEY MILK: maybe a little. or not.
CLEVE JONES: i went to spain last month... long story. in barcelona, there was this memorial march for gay people who died under franco. the police tried to break it up. it started a riot. a bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp, his wig flew off, but he kept fighting. there was blood literally running in the gutter.
HARVEY MILK: we could have a revolution here too. but you can't just use the castro to cruise. you gotta fight.
CLEVE JONES: you think you'll win?
HARVEY MILK: winning isn't my strong suit.
CLEVE JONES: well, i don't "do" losing. ever. maybe i should run for office, and you can work for me. if you can do it, i can do it.
HARVEY MILK: can you assemble a thousand people in an hour?
CLEVE JONES: yeah, sure.
HARVEY MILK: all right, if i run again, you're my man.
CLEVE JONES: if...?

ANITA BRYANT: "come to the florida sunshine tree, great tasting orange juice naturally, orange juice with lots of vitamin c, from the florida sunshine tree." 
JIM RIVALDO: we lost, but we lost by less! more votes than ever... i remember when that used to work. i want to show you something. this is remarkable.
JIM RIVALDO: the red is where you did best tonight. if we can get the initiative on district elections to pass, and we can -- we can -- our new supervisor's district will go right up market. right around the castro.

34.: the district jim outlines is all bright red. 
JIM RIVALDO: if you run for supervisor with this new district, it's a potential landslide. you'll be the first up- front gay man elected to major office in the u.s.
HARVEY MILK: i don't know if i have another one in me. or scott.

ANITA BRYANT: gays can't reproduce, so they must recruit young people into their lifestyle... 
TV REPORTER: bryant, a spokeswoman for the orange juice industry, vowed to

TV REPORTER: bring her campaign to the rest of the country... 
HARVEY MILK: scottie?
BOY'S VOICE: i'm sorry sir. i um... i read about you in the paper.
HARVEY MILK: i'm sorry. i can't talk right--
BOY'S VOICE: sir, i think i want to kill myself.
HARVEY MILK: no. you don't want to do that.
HARVEY MILK: where do you live?
BOY'S VOICE: in minnesota.
HARVEY MILK: you saw me in a paper in minnesota?
BOY'S VOICE: my folks are taking me to this place tomorrow. a hospital. to fix me.
HARVEY MILK: there's nothing wrong with you. listen to me. you don't have to hurt yourself, okay? are you there? here's what you have to do. are you listening?
BOY'S VOICE: yes.
HARVEY MILK: get on a bus. go to the next biggest city. new york, san francisco, la, or even minneapolis. it doesn't matter. just leave. you won't be alone. there are people out here just like you who will welcome you and love you.

HARVEY MILK: you're not sick. you're not wrong. 
BOY'S VOICE: i can't.
HARVEY MILK: yes. you can. just get on a bus.
BOY'S VOICE: i can't... i can't walk, sir. i'm in a wheelchair... sir. are you there?
HARVEY MILK: that's okay. it's going to be okay.
DICK PABICH: harvey, you better come down. there's gonna be a riot.

POLICEMAN: if you can't control em', we will. 
HARVEY MILK: give me permission to march them.
POLICEMAN: where?
HARVEY MILK: anywhere.

HARVEY MILK: i know you are angry. i am angry. follow me through the streets of san francisco to share our anger! 
HARVEY MILK: are they following in back?
CLEVE JONES: yes. where are we going?
HARVEY MILK: i don't know.
DICK PABICH: they're still too hot in back.
HARVEY MILK: help me turn them up van ness.

HARVEY MILK: my name is harvey milk... and i want to recruit you. 
HARVEY MILK: i am here tonight to say, we will no longer sit quietly in our closets. we must fight. not just in the castro, or san francisco, but everywhere the anitas go. anita bryant did not win tonight. anita bryant has brought us together... she is going to create a national gay force! and the young people in richmond, minnesota, or jackson, mississippi, or woodmere, new york... who are coming out and hearing anita bryant on television telling them that they're wrong, they're sick, that there is no place for them in this great country, in this world... they're looking to us for something tonight... and i say, we have to give them hope!

HARVEY MILK: better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great... 
64 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT: harvey speaks to a hall filled with teamsters.
HARVEY MILK: hope for the worker who awakens from the american dream to find that all the jobs have left the country... we gotta give em' hope!

HARVEY MILK: evelyn lear's in town, at the opera house in tannhauser. 
SCOTT SMITH: clearly.
HARVEY MILK: what if she strolls into the castro for a cocktail? just one more. we can't let rick stokes take it.
SCOTT SMITH: let rick have it. nobody thinks you're a fraud here, harvey. you're not in new york, you're not a closet case anymore. people respect you here. relax for a year.
HARVEY MILK: if people are ever going to take me seriously, i have to win this one.
SCOTT SMITH: since when did you care if anyone took you seriously?
HARVEY MILK: anita wants to put us all back in concentration camps. rick stokes is too weak to beat her back if she gets to california. i have to be in office to protect us from them.

SCOTT SMITH: i can't do another one. i'll be back for my sheets. if you're not here, i'll see you in the shop next week. 
HARVEY MILK: if you leave me right now... i can find someone new.
SCOTT SMITH: i know. you're a catch.

HARVEY MILK: --ring out the old, ring in the new. this is over. done. i don't want to see anything that say's assembly. this three-time loser is running for supervisor it! 
JIM RIVALDO: who the heck is she?
HARVEY MILK: our new campaign manager. she called last week to volunteer and i asked her to help.
DICK PABICH: help or take over? what about scott?
HARVEY MILK: we need new blood.

HARVEY MILK: guys... anne kronenberg. she's a woman... a woman who likes women. odd, isn't it? 
ANNE KRONENBERG: hi guys. mr. milk... rick stokes isn't pulling out. he's officially filed to run against you. my friend at the advocate says david goodstein is backing him.
MICHAEL WONG: a gay candidate against a gay candidate. it's unfortunate.
JIM RIVALDO: they'll split the gay vote. the straights will divide and conquer.
HARVEY MILK: try to find out when they're going to announce.
DICK PABICH: you replaced scott with a lesbian?
HARVEY MILK: anne worked on a recycling campaign up north. she's very organized.
JIM RIVALDO: how do you know she's not a plant from rick stokes' campaign?
ANNE KRONENBERG: are you guys always this paranoid?
MICHAEL WONG: yes. they take after harvey.
HARVEY MILK: shouldn't you be doing someone's laundry?
MICHAEL WONG: right after you redecorate my house.
ANNE KRONENBERG: sir, my girlfriends say you guys don't like women. just asking, is there a place for us in all this, or are you scared of girls?

HARVEY MILK: gentleman, we already have a tinker bell, a lotus-blossom, jim and in your three-piece suits. we need someone to manage things. a woman this time. she's the right price, and she has bigger than any of you. 
ANNE KRONENBERG: just give me whatever's left over in the register at the end of the day. so should i call the chronicle about getting us an endorsement? no?

RICK STOKES: young lady, you must be confused. 
ANNE KRONENBERG: no, sir. i'm harvey's new campaign manager. anne kronenberg.
RICK STOKES: then you should know this race is for district 5, the castro, not for all of your lesbian... compadres--
ANNE KRONENBERG: i'm sorry. are we distracting you, mr. stokes? i'd hate to screw you up on your big night.
DICK PABICH: hi rick, handsome suit. annie, do you have any more hand cards?

RICK STOKES: these people are not from this area. they need to leave. now. 
DICK PABICH: not true. guess where we found them all, rick? a slew of them. way up on valencia street. living right there in our district. and you see, as it turns out, annie here is very, very popular with the ladies.

HARVEY MILK: they've accused me of many things, but never as blatant a lie as this. 
ANNE KRONENBERG: first ever newspaper endorsement.
CLEVE JONES: they endorsed you for being a good businessman? has scott read this?
HARVEY MILK: yeah? go show him.

HARVEY MILK: cleve, maybe you should go find a boy to celebrate with. just in case. 
CLEVE JONES: i'm going to the stud. meet me out.
GAY MAN: gonna win this time, milk?
JACK LIRA: you're more handsome in the posters.
HARVEY MILK: thank you. where do you live?
JACK LIRA: ...palomino's are my favorite horse. they're smart. they're fast and compact. do you think i'm more like a palomino or a stallion?

JACK LIRA: my father beat me when he found out... so i came here. i stay in this man's house. but i don't like him. 
HARVEY: shh, it's okay, now. no one's ever going to beat you again.
JACK LIRA: i love you.
HARVEY: do you even remember my name? harvey.
JACK LIRA: i love you, harvey.

CLEVE JONES: i'm sorry. we're all full. 
DAVID GOODSTEIN: harvey! harvey!
HARVEY MILK: it's too crowded. sorry!
JACK LIRA: harvey!
HARVEY MILK: scottie--?
CLEVE JONES: the new mrs. milk. i give it a week.
JACK LIRA: harvey, is this all for you? are you this famous?
HARVEY MILK: no, darling. we do this all the time. do you like it?
JIM RIVALDO: carol ruth silver... gordon lau... it's the most liberal board in years!
HARVEY MILK: what about dan white? did he win?
JIM RIVALDO: we'll deal with him tomorrow.

CHANNEL 5 REPORTER: does this mean, as many straights are concerned, maybe the gays are taking over san francisco? are you going to be a supervisor for all the people? 
HARVEY MILK: i have to be. that's what i was elected for. i have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of all people, all their problems, the problems that effect this city effect all of us. thank you san francisco! thank you!

HARVEY MILK: i, harvey milk, do solemnly swear that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states and the constitution of the state of california against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and that i will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which i am about to enter and during such time as i hold the office of supervisor, city and county of san francisco. 
HARVEY MILK: anita bryant said gay people brought the drought to california. looks to me like it's finally started raining!

HOST: this will be the first time in many years that we've seen so many new faces on the board of supervisors. do you think such diversity will cripple the board? 
HARVEY MILK: the name of the game on the board is six votes to get anything passed. so, like it or not, dan and i are now in bed together... politically speaking.
DAN WHITE: i've assured harvey here that my brochure's comments about "social deviants" referred more to junkies than to his people. see, i'm about to have my first child. i have to make sure this city remains a decent place to raise him.

HARVEY MILK: how long were you a fireman, dan? 
DAN WHITE: a couple of years.
HARVEY MILK: and before that... you were a police officer?
DAN WHITE: you have something against cops?
HARVEY MILK: no. they tend to have something against me.

HARVEY MILK: but firefighters. now those are true heroes... they supported me in the last campaign. i support them fully. 
DAN WHITE: i appreciate it.
HARVEY MILK: i meant what i said. i'd like to work together.
DAN WHITE: i'll see you at the office, mr.

HARVEY MILK: what do you think of my new theater? 
CLEVE JONES: a bit over the top.
HARVEY MILK: what's with the suit?
CLEVE JONES: i got it from a friend.
HARVEY MILK: when you come here, i want you to wear the tightest jeans possible. never blend in. and no elevators. ever. always take the stairs, you can make such a grand entrance going up the stairs.

HARVEY MILK: all that. it bugs the out of her. 
HARVEY MILK: morning annie, let's set cleve up on mail.
ANNE KRONENBERG: will do.
HARVEY MILK: come into my office...

HARVEY MILK: the first order of business that will come out of this office is a city wide gay rights ordinance. just like the one anita shot down in dade county. what do you think, lotus blossom? 
MICHAEL WONG: i think it's good. not great.
HARVEY MILK: then make it brilliant. i want anita's attention here. in san francisco. i want her to bring her fight to us... this bill needs a unanimous vote. we need headlines.
JIM RIVALDO: dan white won't vote for this.
HARVEY MILK: dan's fine. he's just uneducated. we can teach him.
DAN WHITE: harvey, committee meets at 9:30. oh, hi michael, jim. hey, did you get the invitation to

DAN WHITE: my son's christening? i invited a few of the other supes as well. 
HARVEY MILK: i'll be there.
DAN WHITE: great!
ANNE KRONENBERG: are you going?
HARVEY MILK: hey. i'll let him christen me, if he'll vote for my gay rights ordinance. we need allies. we need everyone.

HARVEY: jack? 
JACK LIRA: welcome home, harvey! i hope you're hungry. i only know how to cook one thing, but i make it good.
HARVEY: did you... break in?
JACK LIRA: i asked the boy downstairs to let me in...
HARVEY: danny?

JACK LIRA: he wouldn't let me in. so i came in this way. your friends aren't very nice to me. 
HARVEY: i have a town hall meeting tonight, jack.
JACK LIRA: you work too hard. i'm sorry about your window. i'll fix it tomorrow. are you surprised?!
HARVEY MILK: jack, i have to go. i have an invitation to a party tomorrow. lots of rich people, politicians. we could get all dressed up...
JACK LIRA: so i could be the first lady?
HARVEY MILK: uh-huh.
JACK LIRA: i watched tv here today. all day. i saw all my children. they killed margo. i knew it was going to happen. they try and trick you but it never works.
HARVEY MILK: you always see it coming?
JACK LIRA: what? killing the blonde? every time. i'm good with that. i think now the old lady is going to have an affair. then she'll get killed or married. always one or the other. dead or married.

HARVEY MILK: if i make you a key, you won't break my windows again, right? 
JACK LIRA: that's right.

87 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER: harvey and dan have pulled themselves away. 
HARVEY MILK: i'm proposing a citywide ordinance. it ensures that a person who already has a job can't be fired for their orientation.
DAN WHITE: i'm not sure my constituents would favor that.
HARVEY MILK: is anyone else here from the board?
DAN WHITE: you're the only one who showed up i think.
HARVEY MILK: were you christened here?
DAN WHITE: yes. right here. same parish. my grandma immigrated here when this was an irish catholic city. the city of st. francis... a lot's changed here since then.
HARVEY MILK: you're more like one of us now...

DAN WHITE: you're not like most homosexuals, are you, harvey? 
HARVEY MILK: do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"
DAN WHITE: say, where do you stand on the psychiatric center the city's been pushing into my district?
HARVEY MILK: well, i'd have to study it...
DAN WHITE: getting it out of my district was a key piece of my platform. it only attracts arsonist, rapists, all that, you know.
HARVEY MILK: sure, sure. a campaign promise.
DAN WHITE: a big one.
DAN WHITE: what do you say we watch out for each other's interests? i'd like that.
HARVEY MILK: i'd like that, too, dan.
DAN WHITE: i'm sorry. slipped into some shop talk.
HARVEY MILK: the gay rights ordinance. my fault.
MARY ANN WHITE: seems an inappropriate subject in here don't you think?
HARVEY MILK: hey, don't knock it till you've tried it.

DICK PABICH: supervisors silver and lau are asking you to vote to keep this psychiatric center in dan's district. it'll go down 6 to 5 if you vote to get rid of it. 
MICHAEL WONG: it's a youth campus, harvey. these are kids that would be displaced from their families if it's moved.
HARVEY MILK: i can't just dump dan. the guy's got nothing going for him. no friends...
CLEVE JONES: here we go, harvey to the rescue. isn't it enough we have to put up with jack?
HARVEY MILK: lay off. he registered 120 voters last week.
CLEVE JONES: so do any of your volunteers, but you don't make them all first lady.
MICHAEL WONG: what does dan white do for you?
HARVEY MILK: he intrigues me... i think he may be one of us.
CLEVE JONES: dear say it ain't so!
HARVEY MILK: it's just a theory...
DICK PABICH: you just think he's cute.

HARVEY MILK: no... i know what it's like to live that life. that lie. you can see it in dan's eyes... the fear, the pressure... 
HARVEY MILK: good or bad?
ANNE KRONENBERG: not great. state senator john briggs is anita bryant's go-to guy in california for sure. he's filed his petition for a statewide referendum to fire all gay teachers and anyone who supports them.
HARVEY MILK: how many signatures will he need to qualify for the ballot?
CLEVE JONES: whatever. he can get them in two sundays at church in orange county.
HARVEY MILK: this means the fight's coming here, where we can do something about it! wichita's one thing, kansas city. but anita's heading for san francisco! she's not going to know what hit her. smile, children! this is the fight we've been waiting for.

JOHN BRIGGS: do it in our public schools. it's time to root them out. 
TOM AMMIANO: and how are you going to determine who's a homosexual?
JOHN BRIGGS: sir, my bill outlines procedures for identifying homosexuals.
ANOTHER PROTESTER: how? will you be sucking them off?
JOHN BRIGGS: sir, you can argue with me, but you cannot argue with

DAVID GOODSTEIN: oh harvey... your boyfriend is in the closet. 
HARVEY MILK: excuse me, david?
RICK STOKES: the latino, he's locked himself in the coat room... mr. milk, phil burton is here. he's likely the next speaker of the house and a much needed ally against prop six.

HARVEY MILK: you're right, i know, i was late by twenty minutes. i'm sorry, jack. 
JACK LIRA: who were you with? scott? some boy?
HARVEY MILK: i was at work. come out, sugar pea.
JACK LIRA: no. you embarrassed me. i didn't know anyone. these are not good people. i don't want to be here.
HARVEY MILK: then go home, jack.
JACK LIRA: no. i'll wait for you. go away.

DAVID GOODSTEIN: the briggs initiative is polling at 75 percent for approval statewide. 
CLEVE JONES: 80 percent in other polls. some even have us losing san francisco.

DAVID GOODSTEIN: so it's important we not deceive people into thinking we can beat this, or we'll have riots and only increase this backlash. 
HARVEY JONES: good point, david. let's just roll right over. make it easier for briggs to us up the ass.
PHIL BURTON: we're taking this very seriously in my office. we want to send one of these to every home in california.
HARVEY MILK: "proposition six is an affront to human rights. an invasion of the state into the private lives of california citizens." does it even say the word gay on this thing? anywhere?
DAVID GOODSTEIN: no harvey, purposefully not.
PHIL BURTON: with the heat bearing down on your movement right now, we think it's best to dodge the "gay" bullet. go for the human rights angle.
HARVEY MILK: people need to know who's affected. this flier needs at least one old queen on it. why don't you volunteer for that, david?
RICK STOKES: corey wares is an out gay--

HARVEY MILK: this is and masturbation. it's a coward's response to a dangerous threat. 
DAVID GOODSTEIN: i think you should leave.
HARVEY MILK: jack, it's time to go. get everyone together. i want young people, women, fresh heads. fighters and organizers, not politicians.
CLEVE JONES: what about, s-c-o-t-t?

JIM RIVALDO: but we can't afford infighting anymore, cleve. we have to bring together every group. even the old school democrats. 
HARVEY MILK: is anybody gonna pay the pizza guy, or are we just gonna stare?
HARVEY MILK: if we're gonna convince the 90% to give a about us 10%... we have to let 'em know who we are. everybody's coming out. the entire state. no matter where they live.
DICK PABICH: "come out, come out, wherever you are!"
HARVEY MILK: i'm serious. we're going to tell everyone in the state to come out. every gay doctor, lawyer, teacher, dog catcher... we have to leave the ghetto, let all those people out there know that they do know one of us. and if people won't step out of the closet, we open the door for them.
ANNE KRONENBERG: 
SCOTT SMITH: the whole state is not san francisco.
HARVEY MILK: clearly, scott.
JIM RIVALDO: it could be dangerous. there is such a thing as a right to privacy.

HARVEY MILK: privacy's our enemy. you want real political power? let's tell the truth for a change. starting here. if there's anybody in this room, right now, who hasn't told their families, their friends, their employers... do it. now. 
ANNE KRONENBERG: my folks know already.
DICK PABICH: i haven't told my father yet...
HARVEY MILK: people vote two to one for us if they know just one of us.
HARVEY MILK: cleve, show where you keep your phone.
CLEVE JONES: it's in the bedroom.

HARVEY MILK: i thought you were done with politics. 
SCOTT SMITH: politics. not the movement. what the was that in there?
HARVEY MILK: the movement needs people to be up- front. why were you fighting me?
SCOTT SMITH: you were the biggest closet case alive in new york. you told me and all your boyfriends to keep our

SCOTT SMITH: traps shut. you were the hypocrite in there. 
HARVEY MILK: my parents are gone. my brother knows. i'm sure they knew.
SCOTT SMITH: i had to listen to your phone calls home to mom. hear you deny that i existed. you want to be "normal" as bad as any of us. more than any of us... those are kids in there. you're asking them to lose their families.
HARVEY MILK: if their families won't love them for who they are, who they really are, then they should lose them.
SCOTT SMITH: that's insane.
HARVEY MILK: who's he? do you live together?
SCOTT SMITH: someone i'm seeing. he's good for me. he makes me stay home at nights, out of the bars...
HARVEY MILK: i miss you.
SCOTT SMITH: oh, harvey, don't... what's that about?
JACK LIRA: har-veyyyyy!
HARVEY MILK: he needs me.

HARVEY MILK: --i want it noted that i never promised to back moving any mental health centers. i greatly respect supervisor white, but i would like his remarks stricken. 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: duly noted. we will take a recess before recording the vote.
CAROL RUTH SILVER: thank you, harvey.
DAN WHITE: can i have a moment with harvey? alone, please, carol?
DAN WHITE: why are you turning on me like this at the last minute? what did i do?
HARVEY MILK: i didn't have all the details. i'll help you craft a different version that doesn't displace any kids.
DAN WHITE: harvey, i can't go back to my family and to my folks and to my district without this. don't do this.
HARVEY MILK: i'm getting a lot of pressure, dan.
DAN WHITE: you strung me along. and now you're throwing me to the wolves.

HARVEY MILK: you only need one more vote, dan. there are 5 other supervisors you could convince besides me. 
DAN WHITE: i'll vote against your queer law.
HARVEY MILK: it'll still pass. you can't keep alienating yourself here, dan.
DAN WHITE: i gave you a chance, harvey. i really did. you blew it. you really blew it.

ANITA BRYANT: lifting her hand with 
BRIGGS'S): on to california!

CLEVE JONES: they're moving. i don't know where, but... 
HARVEY MILK: did jim call the press? get out there with your camera!
DANNY NICCOLETTA: i'm going!
CLEVE JONES: press is covered. but we don't have a permit to march.
HARVEY MILK: when i got coors out of the bars, the union gave me this. i want you to have it.
CLEVE JONES: what do i do with this?

HARVEY MILK: you're an activist. take it. march them. march those people up to the front doors of city hall. when it looks really bad, the city's first gay supervisor will come out and play peacemaker. we save the city from a riot. we can turn this night into more political power for the cause. 
CLEVE JONES: i can't do it like you do it.
HARVEY MILK: i won't always be here. somebody else will have to take over. i need you to be the scary one now.

CLEVE JONES: forty years ago tonight, the gay citizens of germany found out they no longer had civil rights. tomorrow morning, the gay citizens of wichita will also awaken to find that they too have lost their civil rights. you have whistles. you use them when we have been attacked. tonight we have been attacked. 
CLEVE JONES: harvey!
CLEVE JONES: get the press to the overpass!

69.: cleve gets to the head of the crowd. 
CLEVE JONES: move... left... move... left...
JIM RIVALDO: what are you doing? where's harvey?
CLEVE JONES: we're shutting down traffic, both directions.
CLEVE JONES: disconnect the power arms!

CLEVE JONES: they're calling it a "successful mediation." you're a hero. 
HARVEY: lose the note cards next time. your job is just to say into that bullhorn what they're all feeling.
CLEVE JONES: you're just jealous it wasn't you out there.
HARVEY MILK: we're losing prop six by 60% and you're over there celebrating a riot. i need more visibility... if we're going to beat this thing, we have to get briggs to acknowledge us.
ANNE KRONENBERG: every paper's calling prop six the main event now. we lose this, we'll have anti-gay laws in all fifty states, and briggs won't return our calls for a public debate.
DICK PABICH: he's ignoring us to death.
HARVEY MILK: we need something populist. what's the number one complaint about city life?
CLEVE JONES: the smell in the tenderloin.

HARVEY MILK: close. 
FRANK ROBINSON: dog
JIM RIVALDO: if you cleaned up all the dog in the city, you could be elected mayor.
CLEVE JONES: "mayor milk."
HARVEY MILK: i like it.

CLERK: supervisor lau? 
GORDON LAU: aye.

CLERK: lau, aye. supervisor silver? 
CAROL RUTH SILVER: aye.
CLERK: silver, aye. supervisor white?
DAN WHITE: no.
CLERK: white, no. madam president, i have ten ayes and one no.
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: the san francisco gay rights ordinance sponsored by supervisors milk and silver is passed.

MAYOR MOSCONE: i can't get my stories on page ten, you're getting page one? 
HARVEY MILK: doggy-doo's a real problem, george.
HARVEY MILK: powder blue to sign they city's first gay rights law... george, we need your help with briggs... the gay community will have your back from now on. on all issues. i hope you'll have ours.

HARVEY MILK: what are you working on, dan? 
DAN WHITE: if you have something to discuss, you can have your aide make an appointment with my aide.
HARVEY MILK: listen, i know you're disappointed about the psychiatric center...
DAN WHITE: now you need something from me. you want my me to join in with the queers on this prop six business?
HARVEY MILK: we prefer the word "gay," dan. just as i'm sure you prefer the word, "irish-american" to "mick."
DAN WHITE: harvey, our society can't exist without the family, without the church.
HARVEY MILK: we're not against those things.
DAN WHITE: you're not? can two men reproduce?
HARVEY MILK: no. but, we keep trying!

HARVEY MILK: c'mon, dan. you're channeling anita and briggs... we can work together. 
DAN WHITE: okay. you introduce an initiative for supervisor pay raises.
HARVEY MILK: it's a bad time politically. i have an election next year.
DAN WHITE: you asked for something. introduce pay raises. i can't take care of my family on our salaries. you don't have that problem, do you?
DAN WHITE: mr. milk, you'll excuse me, i have a development meeting.

HARVEY MILK: what's wrong, taco bell? 
JACK LIRA: anne and cleve tried to cut me out of your table. you should fire them.
HARVEY MILK: i'll take it under consideration. why don't you get us a drink?
SCOTT SMITH: don't let cezar chavez hear you calling him taco bell.

HARVEY MILK: he's getting better. he's enrolling in classes on monday. 
SCOTT SMITH: i remember when your birthdays were a bit less... lavish. more intimate.
HARVEY MILK: who invited you? anne?
SCOTT SMITH: my boyfriend got an invitation. i was his "plus one."
HARVEY MILK: congratulations. it was a tough ticket to get.
SCOTT SMITH: congratulations to you. looks like you're part of the machine now. you can do better.
HARVEY MILK: when i come home to jack, i don't have to talk politics or talk intelligently. or even talk.
HARVEY MILK: and where's an old man like me going to get such a good looking young man, right?
SCOTT SMITH: you're not so old. you look handsome... happy 48th. looks like you're gonna make it to fifty after- all, mr. milk.

DAN WHITE: sorry i missed the party, harv... 
HARVEY MILK: no problem, dan. good to see you.
DAN WHITE: dog poop?
HARVEY MILK: yeah.
DAN WHITE: it's good! it's a good one.
HARVEY MILK: thanks. but it's a real problem.
DAN WHITE: oh, yeah. i mean, knows how many problems it causes. all kinds of diseases, birth defects probably, i mean, stuff you can't even... hey, i got you a little something.
HARVEY MILK: you didn't have to--
DAN WHITE: you didn't have to--
DAN WHITE: why do people always say that? "you didn't have to?" i mean, of course, right? but, that's what they always say. they always say things like that...
HARVEY MILK: are you okay, dan?

DAN WHITE: oh, what? yeah, sure. harvey, i just... i just want to say... happy birthday. 
DAN WHITE: i've really learned a lot from watching you, harvey.
HARVEY MILK: i doubt that.
DAN WHITE: no, i have. you gotta get out there. get noticed. that's how it works. but, you have an issue.
HARVEY MILK: it's more than an issue, dan. dan. i've had four relationships in my life. three of those four tried to kill themselves. i know it was my fault they did it. i told them to stay quiet. to hide. most of my life i've been closeted. that's what living this life is like for most of us. the way things are... this isn't just about our jobs, or any issue, it's our lives we're fighting for.
DAN WHITE: i've learned a lot from you, harvey. i'm going to get my picture in the papers, too. you'll see. i've got my own issue. that's right. dan white's got an issue!

DAN WHITE: i see naked men walking around, naked women walking around, which doesn't bother me as far as my personal standards of nudity, but it's not proper. we wouldn't allow it for any other parade in san francisco, and it should not be allowed for the gay parade. 
ANNE KRONENBERG: it came in the mail today.
HARVEY MILK: "you get the first bullet the minute you stand at the microphone." looks like the publicity's working.
ANNE KRONENBERG: you don't have to go up there.
HARVEY MILK: it could happen any day, any night, any time... the nation's eye is on us. i have to do this.

HARVEY MILK: my name is harvey milk, and i want to recruit you. i want to recruit you for the fight to preserve your democracy. brothers and sisters, you must come out. come out to your parents. i know that it is hard and will hurt them but think about how they will hurt you in the voting booth! come out to your friends, if they indeed are your friends. come out to your neighbors, to your fellow workers. once and for all, break down the myths, destroy the lies and distortions. for your sake. for their sake. for the sake of the youngsters who are becoming scared by the votes from dade to eugene. on the statue of liberty it says "give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free." in the declaration of independence it is written "all men are created equal and are endowed with certain inalienable rights." for mr. briggs and mrs. bryant and all the bigots out there, no matter how hard you try, you cannot erase those words from the declaration of independence. no matter how hard you try, you cannot chip those words from off the base of the statue of liberty. that is what america is. love it or leave it. 
CLEVE JONES: the mayor says briggs is on his way here. he could intercept him for us. we could get him face to face.
HARVEY MILK: get the press.

JOHN BRIGGS: the parade is the other direction. 
DRIVER: they're taking us another way, sir.

JOHN BRIGGS: i have a right to be here, mr. mayor. 
MAYOR MOSCONE: i'm afraid it's not in the interest of your safety, or my public's safety to let you into that parade grounds.
HARVEY MILK: hi, i'm harvey milk. it's quite an honor to meet you, mr. briggs.
JOHN BRIGGS: i'm aware. sad you're too afraid to fight this out in public, mr. milk.
HARVEY MILK: no sir. i would love to have a public debate. i'm very interested in the details of your argument.
JOHN BRIGGS: you know the details. as do the people. look at the votes across this nation. the "public" is with me.
HARVEY MILK: yes sir, today they are. but with my city's mayor and the san francisco press as my witnesses, i'm challenging you to a public debate.

HARVEY MILK: senator, as a christian it's interesting that you don't seem to understand what christ was about. he was about accepting people and giving love, not carrying a bible in one hand and hatred in the other... ...now all the gay myths have been shattered, all the fears, all the-- 
JOHN BRIGGS: not in my mind they haven't--
HARVEY MILK: that's it. in your mind they haven't, and i'm wondering why--
JOHN BRIGGS: mr. milk, we don't allow people who believe in practicing to teach our children, and the reason we don't is because it is illegal. but it's not illegal to be a homosexual in california.
HARVEY MILK: and your law goes even further. any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired--
JOHN BRIGGS: true. but, gay people don't have children of their own. if they don't recruit our children, they'd all die away. that's why they want to be teachers, to encourage our children to join them.
HARVEY MILK: how do you teach homosexuality? like french? i was born of heterosexual parents, i was taught by heterosexual teachers in a fiercely heterosexual society. so then why am i homosexual? and no offense meant, but if it were true that children mimicked their

HARVEY MILK: teachers, you'd sure have a helluva lot more nuns running around. 
116 EXT. CITY HALL - DAY: briggs makes a statement to the press.
JOHN BRIGGS: if they're going to lead such an open life of homosexuality that they want a 21-gun salute every time somebody goes by them, those people are going to be in danger of being removed their job.
HARVEY MILK: we were really genuinely frightened by proposition six, and with the backlash gaining strength, we were very pessimistic. we didn't think there was any chance we could beat it. what we hoped to do was to organize to the point that when we did lose, there would be a revolt... that all would break lose.
DICK PABICH: people are coming out, though. we met with groups in bakersfield, redding, a dozen people showed up in a library basement in fresno asking for our support if they came out. last sunday, the reverend of st. mary's came out to his entire congregation...
HARVEY MILK: we're still losing, 60 to 30. we have to take the show on the road. call briggs's office. do a press release. tell them he can pick the town, the audience, and i'll ask our supporters not to attend.

DICK PABICH: their audiences are insanely devout. we'll get killed. 
HARVEY MILK: get me orange county.
118 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT: jack is flipping out, storming around the place.
JACK LIRA: you just have to go down to la and guess the right things on tv and they'll pay us... you have to use your fame now while you have it. we could have nice things.
HARVEY MILK: i don't have time to do game shows right now...
JACK LIRA: you are horrible! i have worked on this surprise for you for weeks!
HARVEY MILK: are you drunk right now?
JACK LIRA: you are an ungrateful asshole!
HARVEY MILK: jack, i'll have more time soon.
JACK LIRA: you're ashamed of me!
HARVEY MILK: that's not true. i think you're smart. you're capable. no matter what your family or your father said. i believe in you... we should figure out something for you to do. i could get you a job.
JACK LIRA: i'll never be good enough for you!

HARVEY MILK: if in your statements here you say that child molestation is not an issue, why do you put out literature that hammers it home, why do you play on that myth and fear? 
JOHN BRIGGS: same thing with vd harvey, we put out publications about vd so you can avoid it.
HARVEY MILK: but you've even admitted that there's more molestation in the heterosexual group! so why not get rid of the heterosexual teachers?
JOHN BRIGGS: we are not talking about homos... child molestation, the fact is, at least 95 percent of the people are heterosexual. if we took heterosexuals out and homosexuals out, you know what--
JOHN BRIGGS  HARVEY MILK: --we'd have no teachers we'd have no teachers--
HARVEY MILK: --no child molestation... so you're saying the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child molestation?
JOHN BRIGGS: no, no, i'm not saying that at all--

HARVEY MILK: that's what you just said. 
JOHN BRIGGS: no. i'm saying that we cannot prevent child molestation so let's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group--
HARVEY MILK: --sir, in your own drive for personal power, how many careers are you willing to see destroyed? how many lives will you destroy in your for power, and when will you stop?

JACK LIRA: nothing. i just want to know when you'll be home. 
HARVEY MILK: you just had them pull me out of my big vote on the dog ordinance.
JACK LIRA: it's poop, harvey. aren't i more important than poop?
HARVEY MILK: yes, but... i don't know when i'll be home. maybe 6. 6:15.
JACK LIRA: fine. 6:15.
HARVEY MILK: dan? how's the baby?
DAN WHITE: you didn't bring up supervisor pay raises. in fact, i heard you plan to publicly oppose them.
HARVEY MILK: i heard you planned to vote against them too, dan. were you trying to set me up?

DAN WHITE: it's not a good time for me to bring it up. politically. 
HARVEY MILK: dan, there's a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement, give me that and i'll consider backing pay raises.
DAN WHITE: i don't trade votes... unlike you, the way i was raised, we believe in right and wrong. moral and immoral.
HARVEY MILK: black skin and white in your police department? dan, even ronald reagan's come out against proposition six. you're looking more and more out of touch.
DAN WHITE: if i come out against prop six, it's only for the invasion of state's rights issue.
HARVEY MILK: and the potential witch hunts against you "straight people," right?
DAN WHITE: you underestimate me, milk. you're very, very wrong about me.
HARVEY MILK: i don't know what you mean.
HARVEY MILK: what is it, dan? you can tell me.

HARVEY MILK: to the gay community all over this state... my message to you is... so far a lot of people joined us and rejected proposition six, and now we owe them something... we must destroy the myths once and for all, shatter them. we must continue to speak out... and most importantly, most importantly, every gay person must come out. 
HARVEY MILK: tonight... tonight it is clear that everyone out there does know one of us. and now that they do, they see we are not sick... they can feel we are not wrong... and they know we should have a place in this great country and in this world... a message of hope has been to sent to all the young people out there... to all those afraid of this wave of hate... to all those who have lost their homes and their hometowns... tonight we know there is a place for us! my brothers and sisters... we can come home again!

HARVEY MILK: how many of our propositions has dan shut down? we could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense. cement rent control. it's his vote on this board that stands in our way.
MAYOR MOSCONE: i get it, harvey. i've been lobbied all week. enough.
HARVEY MILK: let me just remind you that you're up for re-election. if you re- appoint dan, you lose the gay vote. they listen to me. you won't get elected dog catcher.

DIANNE FEINSTEIN: all i know is that we're getting a new supervisor today. if dan shows up, just avoid him. we don't need a scene today, right harvey?
HARVEY MILK: heaven forbid, dianne.

DAN WHITE: you can't take this away from me! 
MAYOR MOSCONE: the issue is what's fair, for the people of your district. take some time off. spend it with your family.

HARVEY MILK: this time next year we're marching on washington d.c. it'll look like market and castro, but with a million people. write that down. tell president carter we're coming after him next. i'm going to deposit this. i'll be back in 20 minutes. 
DAN WHITE: say, harve, can i see you for a minute?
HARVEY MILK: sure.

SCOTT SMITH: where is everybody? didn't anyone give a damn? 
HARVEY MILK: i ask this... if there should be an assassination, i would hope that five, ten, one hundred, a thousand would rise. i would like to see every gay lawyer, every gay architect come out--

HARVEY MILK: --if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door... and that's all. i ask for the movement to continue. because it's not about personal gain, not about ego, not about power... it's about the "us's" out there. not only gays, but the blacks, the asians, the disabled, the seniors, the us's. without hope, the us's give up-- 
HARVEY MILK: --i know you cannot live on hope alone, but without it, life is not worth living. so you, and you, and you...
