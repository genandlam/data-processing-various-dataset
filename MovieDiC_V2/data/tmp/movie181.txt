GLADYS: showtime.

DOCUMENTARIAN: do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea? 
GLADYS: oh yah-sure, i know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy-legged women's libbers say, "pageants are old- fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
IRIS: what's sick is women dressin' like men!
GLADYS: uh... you betcha, iris. yah-i think yous boys'll find that things are different here in mount rose... civil servettes ad-lib agreement. gladys for one thing, y'know, we're fearin' folk - every last one of us... civil servettes ad-lib agreement. gladys you won't find a back room in our video store... servettes ad-lib "amen. yah-you betcha." etc. gladys ...that filth is better left in the "sin cities."
IRIS: a.k.a. minneapolis - st. paul.

IRIS: gladys -- gladys! look out!

GLADYS: oh, my! hello, father donigan! sidewalks, sidewalks? iris mimes drinking, "glug, glug." gladys iris, stop! it's not his fault. the communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them. 
IRIS: that's why we lutherans use grape koolaid for the blood of christ.

IRIS: oh, there's a parking space over there. oh, no, that's just a compact. sorry. 
GLADYS: you'd think they'd build the parking lot of america to go with the mall of america!
IRIS: it's a two-hundred dollar fine!
GLADYS: i said i'd move if a cripple came. let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
IRIS: all right, let's go.

GLADYS: wait! wait! wait! wait! wait! wait! wait! i just thought of the theme. 
IRIS: oh! what is it? gladys "proud...to be...an...american." servettes react with pleasure.

GLADYS: last year? it was, "buy american."
DOCUMENTARIAN: and the year before that?
GLADYS: "u.s.a. is a-okay."
DOCUMENTARIAN: can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?

TAMMY: yeah, you bet i do. i mean, maybe other people think i can't win a beauty pageant. but other people didn't think i could beat out becky leeman for president of the gun club, either. and i did. i-i-it's just like anthony robbins says, "i'm a winner. nobody can stop me but me!" 
TAMMY: kabloom! tammy's john deere thresher blows up!

GLADYS: well, you know, i think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young. 
IRIS: it's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. it's just so odd and gross.
GLADYS: you know that sometimes it's hard to understand great plan.
IRIS: yeah.
FEMALE MOURNER #1: may i have a tissue?
GLADYS: but the show must go on. i gotta get a hold of ted and ask him if we can use that barn light as a spot again. so you watch the jell-o salad, okay?

PREGNANT FRY GIRL: this pageant's like a roach motel.

BECKY: "who are you?!" oh mary, you kill me. she always says that. it's a little game we play. every week - same dippy little look on her face. "who are you - who are you?" just like that. it's me - becky - and i brought your favorites. becky puts the chocolates on mary's lap, a few spill. throughout the following, mary slowly reaches for them as if they're forbidden fruit and she's a very hungry eve.
AMBER: how nice, becky, she's anorexic.
BECKY: she's skinny, not deaf, amber.

BECKY: japan.
LESTER: that's enough, young lady.

GLADYS: i'll field that one - rebecca's saving her voice. becky smiles admiringly at gladys. gladys you-betcha, rebecca's ready. she's been singin' and dancin' since she was knee high to a pig's eye. 
LESTER: yah-she's near as good as that little black fella - with the glass eye.

HAROLD: ...oh you betcha! we're happier than the day hanky got acquitted. i get made a judge, then the furniture store hires us to paint the whole thing. we're gonna use the money to get our mamma a proper headstone. oh, and move her out to the cemetery.

LESTER: hey tim, carla - if yous kids don't try to jew me down none, i'll throw in a matchin' hutch. the couple smiles excitedly. lester see, that there's my specialty. don't pay me less and i'll give ya more. secret is, the hutch is included in the price. ain't that right, jean?

LORETTA: why do i think becky'll win? you're talkin'... don't pinch!. you're talkin' kbout the richest family in a small town. it's front page news when one of kem takes a can one of yous boys give me a ride home?
ANNETTE: don't fall for it. she lives two trailers down.
LORETTA: so? be real easy.
ANNETTE: go on home, loretta. come on. go on, the party's over.
LORETTA: anyone?

DOCUMENTARIAN: so you know, brett just got shot in the head. 
BECKY: he did? well, huntin's dangerous...so, anyways, my mom gave me this 30-aught for my sixteenth birthday...
MR. LARSON: amber, i need stella now!
AMBER: sorry. i just thought she might not wanna meet her maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
MR. LARSON: well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother." the clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. pink cheeks, and...
AMBER: -- red nose and ears. i know, i know.
AMBER: sorry i couldn't talk today kcause...i'm scared, okay? i open my locker right after first period and there's a picture of tammy curry taped inside.

TWIN OFFICER #1: oh-yah, helluva way to go, there. after some extensive investigation, we figure the curry girl musta been drivin' and smokin' and kablewey! 
TWIN OFFICER #2: not enough left of her to fill a tin.

AMBER: yah-sure, tammy liked to driver her dad's thresher - she said the heavy vibration helped her think, y'know? but i know for a fact she only smoked after a good drive. you ask me or anyone else who isn't scared to talk about it - tammy was murdered. i bet diane sawyer never had to deal with like this... toss me "caucasian 5," would ya? 
MR. LARSON: amber...
AMBER: no, don't say it. another stray bullet to the head. she adjusts brett's red plaid hunting cap. amber i'm gonna need more caps.

AMBER: mommmm! i'll be right behind you in the hearse!
LORETTA: don't let that worry you, annette!

DOCUMENTARIAN: so, doctor, is this sort of an unusual injury here? 
DOCTOR: oh you betcha, this was a doozy. right now, our chief concern is to stabilize annette, then, in surgery, remove this here.

LORETTA: annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
LORETTA: you're what?!
AMBER: i-i'm quittin' the pageant.
LORETTA: i heard you, i was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. oh for chrissakes, amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a lawn dart!
AMBER: oh i'm dead...
CANDY STRIPER: hey, lil' miss sad-pants and her friend serious sally, how kbout some nice cool mints to turn those frowns upside-down. "s."
AMBER: so, what do i say?
LORETTA: simple. just say, "mom, i know you sacrificed everything - relationships, dreams - your tummy, and thighs - all to bring me into this world. all so i could have tap lessons and be in the pageant - the same one you were in. but, y'know what? i'm quittin'." there. easy as pie.
AMBER: oh my i'm so dead...
LORETTA: yeah, you betcha...

ANNETTE: go on! get out! 
AMBER: mom, look, don't say anything. first of all, i'm not pregnant.
ANNETTE: i ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. i'm reaching' a point where i'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
AMBER: okay. yesterday i...i got this picture. so i kinda, y'know, i'm thinkin' no. i'm gonna, i-i-i'm gonna quit the pageant.
ANNETTE: what?!
AMBER: ow!

AMBER: nice mouth you got there, mom, but i- i'm not goin' through this again. 
ANNETTE: you're not goin' through this again? you? you're not the one who knows how jiffy pop feels.
AMBER: oh, c'mon... first the picture of tammy, then brett clemens, now this? it's scary.
ANNETTE: let me tell you "scary," amber. look at me. do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? i'm a "lifer" here. best i can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
AMBER: that's it, i'm goin'...
ANNETTE: honest to if i got to do it over? i'd start walkin' outta this town the minute i took my first step. practically the only thing i wouldn't do different is have you...
AMBER: i hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
ANNETTE: it's me...i just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. this pageant's your ticket outta here. i know you can win, amber. annette c'mere. i love you so much.
AMBER: i love you much.
LORETTA: hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
AMBER: no. mom said if i did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
DOCUMENTARIAN: so has your mom kept your dad's life a secret?
AMBER: no. she never hid the fact that my dad picked his career over us. what'd she used to say?
LORETTA: "once a carnie, always a carnie."
AMBER: oh-yah.
TWIN OFFICER #1: the atkins fire? foul play? shit-no. after some thorough investigatin', we determined it musta been a bad wirin'. mosta them trailer-folk plug a tv, vcr, crock pot and fry-daddy into one outlet and don't think nothin' of it ktil kablewey!
TWIN OFFICER #2: not enough left to fill a tin.

ANNETTE: "bad wirin'?!" well, if that ain't the biggest crock-a-shit ever. ooowwww-jesus! did k-mart have a sale on dull needles? 
CANDY STRIPER: i-i just need one more "do-over."

GLADYS: so, remember the three most important parts of a good interview... 
IRIS: okay, everybody, listen up!
GLADYS: number one, american teen princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers. the girls put their knees together. gladys excuse me, miss penthouse ninety- eight, put your knees together. i could drive a boat show in there. gladys paces. gladys ankles together. hands resting lightly on your laps. good. sit up straight. smile!

GLADYS: all right. number two: the judges are as nervous as you are. 
DOCUMENTARIAN: so are you about ready to start the judging - start the interview, there?
JOHN: uh, i-i guess i could answer that. yep. we're ready. so, we should probably get the young girls in here, then. y'know, to start the interviews...

HAROLD: uh, "if you could be any tree in the woods, what kinda tree would you be?" 
TESS: dogwood.
V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE: on molly howard, seated.
MOLLY: bonsai.
V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE: on leslie, seated.
LESLIE: green?
V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE: on michelle johanson, seated.
MICHELLE: a tree? i can be any tree you want. gimme a minute.
V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE: on becky, seated.
BECKY: one with strong roots in a community like mount rose, a solid christian trunk and long leafy branches to provide shade for handicapped kids on a hot summer day.

HAROLD: "who would you pick to be president, dead or alive?" pan over to molly howard. 
MOLLY: uh, emperor hirohito.
V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE: on leslie, seated...
LESLIE: brett favre!
V.F.W. - BACK ROOM - MONTAGE: on becky, seated.
BECKY: my mother, kcause she could solve world hunger with one of her blue- ribbon rhubarb pies, create world peace with one of her prayers and still find time to look beautiful...for my dad, lester leeman.

JOHN: what the is she trying to say? say it! 
JANELLE: the ktards pants are completely off!
HAROLD: close up shop. close up shop, hank.
HANK: harold!
HAROLD: close up shop!

HAROLD: you amber atkins? 
AMBER: yes. yes i am. thank you, hello.
HAROLD: "name and spell all the united states in alphabetical order." pan over to a stunned amber.
AMBER: seriously?
HAROLD: ah-yep.
AMBER: well, ah...alabama. a-l-a-b-a-m-a. alaska. a-l-a-s-k-a. arizona. a-r-i-

AMBER: west virginia. w-e-s-t-v-i-r-g-n-i-a. wisconsin. w-i-s-c-o-n-s-o-n. wyoming. w-y-o-m-i-n-g. 
HAROLD: uh-okay, then.
MARY: with two weeks until the pageant... i was practicing my talent. finishing my costume, brushing up on current events, and running eighteen miles a day on about four hundred calories. i was ready.

LESLIE: oh-yah, really nervous. it's been about two months. i haven't told my boyfriend yet. how did you know? 
DOCUMENTARIAN: i meant, nervous about the pageant?
LESLIE: oh! nervous about the pageant! yah sure!

TESS: and, uh, this is my lucky bolt. they think it fell from a dc-10. the doctor said i was lucky the flat side hit me, um, otherwise it coulda gone right through my head. i know, i know, gives me the willies, too. i guess the explosion... 
JANELLE: amber? can we switch numbers? i need to go first. my cousin just had a deaf baby and i get to go see it!
AMBER: yah-sure, eight's my luck number anyway. diane sawyer was number eight at her local.
JANELLE: thank you.

GLADYS: i'll be honest. this is a hard time for me. this is the part of the pageant when you realize that tomorrow night, all but one of these girls will walk out of here a loser. it's hard for me to know how that must feel, but i'm sure it doesn't feel good. in b.g., a big stage light falls on janelle's head. crash! gladys and camera rush the stage. "through the eyes of love" continues throughout. 
AMBER: don't you get it? i was supposed to go first. i was contestant number one. that light was meant for my head. if janelle hadn't wanted to change numbers... i owe my life to that deaf baby.
LORETTA: that was your mom. she wanted you to have this.
AMBER: really, loretta?
LORETTA: you-betcha.
AMBER: my mom wanted me to have this?
LORETTA: oh, shut up. i thought it might help you get some sleep.
AMBER: loretta, never have kids.
LORETTA: well god-love-ya for thinkin' i still could.
AMBER: oh...my...god! it's just like diane sawyer's! kcourse it's not a size ten, diane was a little hippy back then. oh, thank you! thank you! thank you!

MRS. HOWARD: go molly! go! number one daughter! 
PAT: whooo! leslie kicks teen princess ass! go muskies!

MOLLY: atomic power makes me, molly howard, proud to be an asian-american. 
TESS: uh, this, uh, my uncle phil's world's largest ball of twine, in bundy minnesota, makes me, um, it makes me proud i'm american - i kinda misunderstood the assignment.

IRIS: okay, okay! listen-up. coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal. number one, gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' with your hips durin' the "physical fitness" routine... 
AMBER: oh my my-my tap costume's gone.
IRIS: uh, amber? we're not puttin' on our talent costumes. you need to put on your "physical fitness" outfit. and let's shake a leg, ladies.
AMBER: no, wait. it-it was here before the openin' number...wait. what am i sayin'? i should just ask you, becky. where is it?
BECKY: what?
AMBER: you heard me. where is it?
BECKY: if you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
AMBER: i just did.
BECKY: well then, you better be willin' to back it up, kcause you're talkin' like crazy.
AMBER: oh-oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, becky - bring it on.
BECKY: well, as my mother says at sunday dinner, "come and get it,"
AMBER: oh, i'll "get it." i'll "get it" all right. i might even take seconds.
BECKY: if you want seconds, then i'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
AMBER: 
IRIS: girls! girls!
BECKY: give me your stringy-ass hair!
AMBER: i'll get you!
CREW GUY: oh don't stop kem now...
BECKY: you're choking my, you
IRIS: y'know, i-i don't think yous boys should, uh, should be in here while the girls are changin'.
AMBER: i hate her!
IRIS: we all do. now let's go.
GLADYS: yah-so how kbout a big round of applause for last year's mount rose american teen princess, in a farewell performance. who could forget her lip- synching to "don't cry out loud," by melissa manchester. and here she is, mary johanson!

IRIS: all right, why don't we take up the stepladders, all right? for the physical fitness number? 
BECKY: they're wet.
LISA: hey, my hands are stuck.
MOLLY: uh, i'm kinda dizzy from the fumes.
IRIS: well, hold kem away from you so it doesn't get on the outfits. what kinda mental paints step ladders the morning of a pageant.

HANK: here come the judge - pinch, pinch - here come the judge - pinch, pinch - here come the judge... 
GLADYS: get back! get back, you total retard!
LORETTA: go hank!
GLADYS: i'm okay, i'm okay - dress is fine. i'm okay...well, our other judges are jean kangas and john dough...

BECKY: hurry up. 
LESLIE: okay, guys, i think we all got some. you just take it off.
AMBER: here, i didn't get any.
LESLIE: here, have some.
MICHELLE: hand me another white one.
LISA: listen, you guys, don't go int the bathroom. tess blew chunks all over. man, she ate a big dinner.
BECKY: maybe she shoulda shoved that lucky bolt down her throat for desert.

IRIS: "i'd like to take you back seventeen years, when a peanut farmer was in the white house, a group-a boys callin' themselves kqueen' topped the record charts and gladys leeman was gladys wood and she was mount rose american teen princess!" gladys enters wearing sash, tiara and plaid culottes. applause. a slide is shown of her at 17. 
GLADYS: thank you, thank you. you know, i won the talent contest by sewing these culottes, butterick pattern 7-4-3-2. can you believe it? they still fit!
LORETTA: she had a big then, she's got a big now.
GLADYS: thank you, thank you. our next eontestant is ready, so let's welcome her: tess weinhaus!
BACKSTAGE - LEFT: amber paces. on stage tess drones on at the mic.
TESS: the beagle is known for it's howl. "aaauuuuuhhhh." the pekinese has it's own distinctive bark. "yip, yip, yip." not to be confused with the chihuahua's, "yap, yap, yap." but none can compare to the greatest bark of all - the german shepherd...
AMBER: ...yah-it's just gone... i mean, i-i just wanna tap, y'know? i'm not sayin' i'm the best, or that i'd even win, but shouldn't i at least get a chance to compete? i just wanted my mom to see me dance.
CHLORIS: amber - amber, c'mere.
AMBER: please, mrs. k, i got so much vaseline on my teeth, i'm gonna be smilin' for a year.
CHLORIS: no. here.
AMBER: mrs. k--
CHLORIS: you're... you're special and... ah hell, go out there and kick some leeman ass.

AMBER: mrs. clark, why are you doing this to me? why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on? 
IRIS: amber, i'm sorry. i really am. but you know the rules. all talent costumes hafta be okay'd by gladys before the pageant.
AMBER: but, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
IRIS: sorry. i-i don't make the rules.
AMBER: this, this... this is
IRIS: amber atkins! that is not american teen princess language!
AMBER: good, kcause this isn't an american teen princess pageant - it's, it's germany!
IRIS: where do they get this stuff...

AMBER: mrs. leeman? 
GLADYS: huh?
AMBER: i-i'm wearin' this costume. i'm, uh, i'm gonna do my talent tonight.
GLADYS: oh really - i don't think so. uh, amber, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. and this... this is why we have the rule. my goodness gracious, i couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. we have kids in the audience.
AMBER: but, you - i mean... it's not my fault. i-i... please? i didn't do anything wrong...
MICHELLE: that's why... i must say... soylent green... is... people.
GLADYS: oops, that's my cue.
MOLLY: wish me luck.
AMBER: good luck, molly.

LISA: oh, amber... 
AMBER: i-i-i-i-i-, j-uh-j-uh-just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
LISA: i can't believe this is happenin'. i can't believe she said you couldn't...
AMBER: "here," wh-wh-what?
LISA: my jacket. take it kcause, y'know, i got my costume okay'd before the pageant. you can wear it.
MICHELLE: oh man, lisa, i wouldn't do this.
LESLIE: they're never gonna let you perform naked. i asked.
LISA: shut up, yous guys. look, amber, i'm not gonna win. and let's be honest, a family only needs one "liza" and you know peter's got much better legs than me.
AMBER: your parents'd kill you.
LISA: oh c'mon, i love kem, but you know they only had me kcause peter needed a kidney.
AMBER: lis, i want to, i really do, but... oh, i can't.
LISA: then do it for peter. mrs. leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. he'd pop his nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, i don't know, got her back.
AMBER: yah?
LISA: oh-you-beccha.
GLADYS: now, it's with overwhelming pride that i introduce contestant number six, who also happens to be president of her class - two years running - a member of the honor roll and the new president of the lutheran sisterhood gun club - rebecca ann leeman!

IRIS: c'mon, lisa. you're up next. 
LISA: i quit. and, uh, since my costume, y'know, was okay'd a month ago? i'm givin' it to amber. amber breaks a smile.
GLADYS: boy, i'd hate to follow that. wow!
CROWD REACTS.: gladys

PREGNANT FRY GIRL: nah. i think i'm like, due or somethin'.
LESTER: ahhh. beautiful as a whore's today. eh, boys?
GLADYS: hey! turn that float around. you think a swan's gonna swim first up main street?

GLADYS: c'mon, rebecca, you wanted it. now get up there. ride it side-saddle if you have to - like a horse. c'mon, now. 
BECKY: it smells funny. like gasoline.
GLADYS: oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in mexico.
BECKY: my dress'll reek.
GLADYS: listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. now get your up there and show me some teeth.

LESLIE: amber, if i die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck? 
AMBER: yeah...
LESLIE: and the bite marks on my ears?
AMBER: yes...
LESLIE: i know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
AMBER: yes, leslie!

HANK: help...hank! help...hank! help...hank! help...hank! 
GLADYS: okay, i designed the float, you know. and, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
