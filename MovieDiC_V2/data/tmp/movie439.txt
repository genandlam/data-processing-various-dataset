DICK VAN DYKE: told you it was your lucky day. bet you thought i was just a fan or something. 
JENNIFER: what happened?
DICK VAN DYKE: a miracle.
DICK VAN DYKE: ... see, every time i thought i'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. they'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... they'd know all about muffin but they wouldn't know about bud ...
DAVID: what the hell's going on!
DICK VAN DYKE: shh! can't talk like that now. you're in ... you know ...

DICK VAN DYKE: well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.

JENNIFER: noooooo! 
DAVID: you--you gotta get us out of here.
DICK VAN DYKE: why would i do that?
DAVID: because we don't belong!
DICK VAN DYKE: oh sure you do ... "mcintire's department store" ... "their father dressed as prince charming." that was gorgeous bud.
DAVID: my name's david.
JENNIFER: oh ...
DICK VAN DYKE: you know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
DAVID: look--we appreciate it. we really do. we just--we want to go home now.
DICK VAN DYKE: but you don't know how long i've been looking for someone like you.
DICK VAN DYKE: i'm very disappointed ... in fact ... i'm starting to get a little upset.
DAVID: don't get upset.
DICK VAN DYKE: weil wouldn't you! you look for someone for years ... you pour your heart into it ... this is a privilege you know. i don't think i better talk about this right now.
DAVID: where are you going ...
DICK VAN DYKE: i don't think we should discuss this until i'm a little bit more composed.

DAVID: oh 
JENNIFER: what's going to happen?
DAVID: i don't know ... it's not possible ... is it possible?
BETTY: bu-ud ... mary sue ... your breakfast is getting cold.
DAVID: it can't be possible.

BETTY: well, come on kids. you're not going off to school without a hot breakfast inside you ... they just stare at her. 
BETTY: forward march.
BETTY: i just love you in that sweater mary-sue. it's so flattering.
JENNIFER: thanks.

DAVID: i don't believe this. 
JENNIFER: neither do i.
GEORGE: well, c'mon. dig in.
BETTY: i put blueberries in them just the way you like.
JENNIFER: actually--i'm not real ... hungry.
BETTY: here. why don't you have some waffle cakes. and there's sausage and eggs and some good crisp bacon ... ... and a ham steak.
BETTY: ... and of course, a nice big bowl of oatmeal.

PAT BOONE: "... tooty fruity--oh rooty. tooty fruity ... oh rooty." 
PAT BOONE: "... tooty fruity--oh rooty ..."

JENNIFER: i'm gonna hurl, david. i swear to 
DAVID: just take deep breaths.
JENNIFER: all that animal fat. i feel it in my pores or something.
JENNIFER: i still don't see why we're doing this.
DAVID: we're supposed to be in school.
JENNIFER: we're supposed to be at home david! we're supposed to be in color! oh ... a man calls out from across the street.
MR. SIMPSON: hello bud.
DAVID: hello mr. simpson.
MR. SIMPSON: hear your dad got a new car.
DAVID: oh yeah. a buick. it's swell.
JENNIFER: you know him?
DAVID: owns the hardware store.
JENNIFER: okay, now you listen to me! i don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! i had a date with mark davis and i even bought new underwear!
DAVID: we just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again.
JENNIFER: play along?
DAVID: well, yeah. i'm ... bud parker and you're ... um--mary sue.
JENNIFER: no! i'm not gonna do it! if i don't dress like this for mom i'm sure as not going to do it for you!
DAVID: we don't have a choice jen. we're stuck until he comes back.
JENNIFER: why can't we just explain it?
DAVID: to who?

FIREMAN: c'mere, kitty ... 
JENNIFER: oh we are. we're stuck in like "nerdville". i always knew you'd pay a price for this. i knew you couldn't be hopelessly geekridden for this long without suffering some like, really tragic consequences. ... but it's just not fair. i mean--i'm starting to get really--popular. debbi russell transferred to another school and my skin's been great since march and mark davis is starting to come around and ...
BOY'S VOICE: hello mary sue.
BIFF: what's all the commotion? where's the cat?
JENNIFER: um ... it's ...
BIFF: ah, right ...
JENNIFER: who's that?
DAVID: biff martin. captain of the basketball team.
JENNIFER: does he--you know--like "me"?
DAVID: as a matter of fact he does.
JENNIFER: hunh.

JENNIFER: those are my friends. 
DAVID: peggy jane, lisa anne and betty jean.
JENNIFER: can we do any better?
DAVID: i don't think so.
LISA ANNE: mary sue. you're gonna be late for geography.
JENNIFER: okay ...

MISS PETERS: last week class, we discussed the geography of main street. this week, we're going to be talking about elm street. can anyone tell me one of the differences between elm street and main street? tommy. 
TOMMY: it's not as long?
MISS PETERS: that's right, tommy. it's not as long. also, it only has houses. so the geography of main street is different than the geography of elm street.

MISS PETERS: mary sue. 
JENNIFER: what's outside of pleasantville?
MISS PETERS: what? i don't understand ...
JENNIFER: outside of pleasantville ... what's at the end of main street?
MISS PETERS: oh, mary sue. you should know the answer to that. the end of main street is just the beginning again.

BIFF: hi ya bud. 
BUD: hi ya biff.
BIFF: can i ask you a question?
BUD: sure.
BIFF: well ... if i was to ask your sister ... what i mean is, if i was to go up to mary sue ...
DAVID: oh are we in that episode?
BIFF: what?
DAVID: i don't believe it.
BIFF: what's the matter?
DAVID: you want to ask her out tonight, right? and then you want to give her your school pin ...
BIFF: yeah ... how'd you know?
DAVID: lucky guess. look, biff ... i don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
DAVID: what i mean is ... mary sue's been a little "different" lately ...
BIFF: she won't go out with me?
DAVID: i didn't say that. it's just that right now ...
BIFF: i don't know what i'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...

DAVID: look, i'm sure we'll work something out. i'll talk to her or something. 
DAVID: honest. it'll be fine.

JENNIFER: no way. 
DAVID: one date, jen--that's all i'm asking. if you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
JENNIFER: it's too weird david. this place is giving me the creeps. did you know all the books are blank?
DAVID: what?
JENNIFER: i looked in the library. they got covers with nothing inside them.
DAVID: what were you doing in a library?
JENNIFER: i got lost. oh here ... look at this!

JENNIFER: just watch. you know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'cause nothing burns around here, that's why! they don't need any firemen ... 
DAVID: jen, listen ...
JENNIFER: i like--really need a cigarette, too.
DAVID: i'll get us out of here. i really will. but if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. we may never get home.
JENNIFER: you really think anybody's gonna, like, notice if i don't have a chocolate malt with this guy.
PEGGY JANE: you won't believe what we just heard.
LISA ANNE: biff martin's going to ask you out.
BETTY JEAN: and that's not all ...
PEGGY JANE: no, that's not all ...
ALL THREE TOGETHER: he's going to give you his pin!

JENNIFER: i could like kill a guy with these things. 
DAVID: it's in your closet.
JENNIFER: i've worn some stuff before ...
DAVID: he won't notice anyway.
JENNIFER: what do you mean?
DAVID: they don't notice that kind of thing.
JENNIFER: so what's the point?
DAVID: jen please ...
JENNIFER: he-llo? i've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
DAVID: just go with the program--hunh? i'm late for work.

MR. JOHNSON: bud? 
DAVID: sorry ... i had to help my folks and then i couldn't find my hat ...
MR. JOHNSON: oh.
MR. JOHNSON: i didn't know what to do.
DAVID: what's wrong?
MR. JOHNSON: well--i always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then i make the french fries ...
DAVID: yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON: but you didn't come so i kept on wiping.
DAVID: i'm sorry.
DAVID: you know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if i haven't put out the napkins yet.
MR. JOHNSON: i'm so glad you're here.
DAVID: i understand.

DAVID: peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders of fries and a split? 
TEEN AGE GIRL: peppermint soda, two chocolate shakes, order of fries, and we'll split it.
MR. JOHNSON: there aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID: what?
MR. JOHNSON: well, usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
DAVID: listen to me!
DAVID: do you have the lettuce?
MR. JOHNSON: ... yeah.
DAVID: have you cooked the burgers?
MR. JOHNSON: yes.
DAVID: well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
DAVID: really. it's fine.

BIFF: i sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight mary sue. 
JENNIFER: well "gee whizz" biff. i sure am glad you asked me.
BIFF: i don't know if i ever said this to you before, but, well ... i think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
JENNIFER: really biff? the keenest?
BIFF: oh yeah.
JENNIFER: gosh. i hardly know what to say.
DAVID: what can i get you two?

BIFF: oh, i dunno bud. guess i'll have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke. 
JENNIFER: oh, i dunno bud. guess i'll just have a salad and an evian water.
JENNIFER: cheeseburger it is.

BIFF: see the whole time we were in civics together, i really wanted to sit next to you--but you were always sitting between peggy jane and lisa anne. 
BIFF: ... and you always seemed so smart and everything. like that report you did on "our town hall." gosh. i didn't know what i'd talk to you about.
JENNIFER: well, sometimes talking's over-rated.
BIFF: hunh? oh, right ...
BIFF: so i know i haven't been steady with anybody, but i just don't want to rush it. you don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
JENNIFER: oh, gosh no.
BIFF: i mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but i figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. don't you?
JENNIFER: oh you bet. will you excuse me for a sec?

JENNIFER: chirist ... 
GIRL'S VOICES: "did he give it to you ... did he give it to you ... i bet he gave it to her ... did he give it to you?"
JENNIFER: i don't think he knows how.
LISA ANNE: i bet he's gonna take her to lover's lane.
PEGGY JANE: i bet he is. i bet he is.
BETTY JEAN: i bet he's even gonna hold her hand!

DAVID: couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes. if you need anything, i'll be right over there. 
BIFF: anyhow ... i really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
JENNIFER: you want to get out of here?
BIFF: what?
JENNIFER: you wanna get out of here? you wanna leave?
BIFF: but where would we go?
JENNIFER: ... lover's lane.
BIFF: lover's lane!
JENNIFER: yeah. lover's lane. you up for it?
CLOSE UP. BIFF.: he just stares at her with his mouth open ...
WIDER.: jennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand.
JENNIFER: c'mon. let's go.

BIFF: sure is pretty. 
JENNIFER: oh yeah ... gorgeous.
BIFF: to be honest mary sue. i didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
JENNIFER: oh, biff. you can "pin" me any time you want to.
BIFF: oh, that's silly mary sue. how could you possibly pin me?

GEORGE: son, what's wrong? 
DAVID: have you seen mary sue?
BETTY: why no. she's still on her date with biff ... is something the matter?
DAVID: no, i ... i was just ... worried about her.
GEORGE: bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys. ... in fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here. that's if she can learn to bake.
BETTY: oh, george ...
GEORGE: but your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.

JENNIFER: ... why? 
BIFF: i think ... i might be ill ...
JENNIFER: it's s'posed to happen, biff.
BIFF: it is?
JENNIFER: trust me ...

DAVID: oh no ... i'm fine. 
BETTY: how 'bout some marshmallow rice squares?
DAVID: i'm fine.
BETTY: now who could that be.

DAVID: oh hi! 
MR. JOHNSON: hi there. you took off so quick. i wasn't sure if you were okay.
DAVID: oh, yeah. sorry. i'm fine. i just ... had to get home early.
MR. JOHNSON: bud ...
DAVID: yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON: you know how when we close up, i close the register, then you lower the shades, then i turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
DAVID: yeah ...
MR. JOHNSON: well you weren't around this time so i did the whole thing myself.

MR. JOHNSON: oh, hello betty. 
BETTY: hello bill.

JENNIFER: hello mr. johnson. 
MR. JOHNSON: oh, hello mary sue.
DAVID: what did you do to him?
JENNIFER: nothing.
DAVID: what do you mean "nothing?" that's not nothing. that's ...
JENNIFER: relax "bud." we had a really nice time. ... now i'm really tired and we gotta get up early for school in the morning so ...
JENNIFER: 'night.

DAVID: oh no ... 
COACH: come on men. let's go. big game next week.
DAVID: oh my ...

DAVID: you can't do this, jennifer. i warned you. 
JENNIFER: so what's the big deal. oh. okay. they're like not good at basketball anymore. like--omigod, what a tragedy.
DAVID: you don't understand. you're messing with their universe.
JENNIFER: well maybe it needs to be messed with. did that ever like--occur to you? you know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
PEGGY JANE: "ms". how you doin'?
JENNIFER: kewl "pj". how you doin'?
PEGGY JANE: "kewl." jennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by.
DAVID: you have no right to do this.
JENNIFER: well if i don't who will?
DAVID: they're happy like this.
JENNIFER: david, nobody's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set. you like all this don't you?
JENNIFER: i mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it. oh i am just so personally horrified right now ...
DAVID: i just don't think we have the right to ...
JENNIFER: david, let me tell you something. these people don't want to be geeks. they want to be "attractive." they've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
DAVID: they don't have that kind of potential.
JENNIFER: um--hello? you want to like take a look?
BOY: wow. what kind of gum is that?

DR. HENDERSON: let me see it again. 
DR. HENDERSON: well ... i don't think it's anything to worry about ... it'll probably just clear up by itself. cut down on greasy foods and chocolate. no french fries, that kind of thing. it's just a "teenage" thing.

DAVID: what'll it be? 
JENNIFER: me too. sounds swell.
DAVID: two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
MR. JOHNSON: there aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID: look. i thought we talked about this, i thought we said ...
MR. JOHNSON: oh--what's the point, bud?

DAVID: what did you say? 
MR. JOHNSON: well ... i'm not sure i see the point anymore.
DAVID: what are you talking about! you make hamburgers! that is the point!
MR. JOHNSON: no i know ... i know i do ... but it's always the same, you know? grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... it never changes. it never gets any better or worse ...
DAVID: just listen to me ...
MR. JOHNSON: ... like the other night, when i closed up by myself. that was different ...
DAVID: forget about that!
MR. JOHNSON: oh ... okay. ... but i really liked it.
DAVID: look, you can't always like what you do. sometimes you just do it because it's your job. and even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
MR. JOHNSON: why?
DAVID: so they can have their hamburgers!
MR. JOHNSON: you know what i really like?
DAVID: ... what's that?
MR. JOHNSON: christmastime.
MR. JOHNSON: see every year on dec 3, i get to paint the christmas decorations in the window. and every year, i get to paint a different thing ... one year it's the north pole. the next i do santa's workshop. here i'll show you.
DAVID: wow ... that's pretty good ...
MR. JOHNSON: thanks. but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year. and then i thought "gee. that seems awfully silly. that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?" david looks at him speechless.
MR. JOHNSON: well don't you?
DAVID: i think you should try not to think about this anymore.
MR. JOHNSON: really?
DAVID: yeah.
MR. JOHNSON: oh. okay. i'll try that then.

GUS: have they ever lost before? 
GEORGE: basketball? no they sure haven't.
BOB: just feels "wrong", that's all.

GUS: yeah. that's a good point, ralph. they do have that saying. 
BOB: but they do win 'em all, gus. they've always won 'em all.
GUS: well, yeah. that's true too.

MARGE: ... he said it would clear up on its own if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets ... 
BETTY: well that makes sense.
MARGE: except it's spread to her lips now too.
MARY: and you say it's just "red?"
MARGE: well--like red, only ... "redder."
MARY: hunh. i know what you mean. that's like the front of bill johnson's shop. i was going by it the other day and it looked green only "greener."

MARGE: have you seen him lately? the man doesn't look like himself. i was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring. wasn't looking at anything in particular--just staring off into space. 
MARY: that is strange.

MARGE: betty, it's your bid. 
BETTY: uh ... seven hearts.

BETTY: mary sue? 
JENNIFER: yeah?
BETTY: can i ask you a question?
JENNIFER: sure.
BETTY: what goes on up at lover's lane?
JENNIFER: what do you mean?
BETTY: well, you hear all these things lately. you know--kids spending so much time up there ... is it holding hands? that kind of thing?
JENNIFER: yeah ... that--and ...
BETTY: what?
JENNIFER: it doesn't matter.
BETTY: no. i want to know.
JENNIFER: ... sex.
BETTY: ah.
BETTY: what's sex?
JENNIFER: you sure you want to know this?
BETTY: yes.
JENNIFER: okay.
JENNIFER: you see mom ... when two people like each other very much ...

BETTY: yes ... it's just that ... 
JENNIFER: what?
BETTY: well ... ... your father would never do anything like that.
SHOT. JENNIFER.: she bites her lip weighing her next sentence ...
JENNIFER: oh. hmm ... well, mom ... there's ways to "enjoy" yourself without dad.
ANGLE. BETTY.: she looks across the table, perplexed.

GEORGE: sweetie? you coming to bed? 
GEORGE: betty?

DAVID: right here! 
FIRE CHIEF: where is it?

DAVID: here! grab this nozzle. 
FIREMAN: but where's the ...
DAVID: just grab it!
DAVID: okay! now point this right at the flames--like this. the fireman nods and does as he is told. david opens the valve sending out a huge flume of water.
FIREMAN: whoa! so that's what these do.
BOB: ... in honor and in recognition of your heroism ...

MARGARET: that was sure swell ... 
DAVID: oh. thanks, margaret.
MARGARET: i baked you my oatmeal cookies.
DAVID: oh, no ... you baked those for whitey.
MARGARET: no. i baked them for you.
DAVID: no. you baked them for whitey.
MARGARET: no. i baked them for you.
DAVID: um ... thanks.
MARGARET: see ya.

JENNIFER: i had nothing to do with that fire. 
DAVID: it's okay.
JENNIFER: not directly anyhow ...
DAVID: it's fine.
JENNIFER: um ... they like wanna ask you a question ... i didn't know how to handle it. so ...
DAVID: sure.
DAVID: how you doin?
VARIOUS KIDS: swell ...
BOY: how'd you know about the fire?
DAVID: what?
BOY: how'd you know how to put it out and all?
DAVID: well--where i used to live ... that's just what firemen did.
BOY: and where's that?
BOY: what's outside of pleasantville?
DAVID: look it doesn't matter. it's not important.
BOY: what is it?
DAVID: it's really not important.
GIRL'S VOICE: what's outside of pleasantville?

MARGARET: c'mon. tell us ... 
DAVID: well ... there are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. there are some places where it keeps on going.
MARGARET: keeps going ...
DAVID: well--it all just keeps going.
2ND BOY: like the "mighty mississippi".
DAVID: ... what?
BOY: "it was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
DAVID: i thought the books were blank?
JENNIFER: they were.
JENNIFER: okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. they asked me what it was about and i like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, but i told them what i did remember, and the next thing i knew the pages had filled in.
DAVID: the pages filled in?
JENNIFER: but like only up to the part about the raft, because i didn't read any farther.

2ND BOY: do you know how it ends? 
DAVID: well, yeah ... i do.
MARGARET: so how does it end?
DAVID: well--see ... they're both running away--huck and the slave ... and ... they go up the river ... but--in trying to get free they sort of see that they're free already.
DAVID: oh my
2ND BOY: wow!
3RD BOY: do you know this one?
DAVID: hunh? oh yeah ... well this is great. see--holden caulfield is like this really lonely kid...

GUS: i don't know phil. it's pretty strange. 
PHIL: i'll say it's strange. gettin' stranger.
PHIL: i mean goin' up to that lake all the time is one thing, but now they're going to a library! i mean what's next?
BURT: oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda.

GEORGE: want some bridge mix? 
BOB: oh, no thanks ...
GEORGE: betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
BOB: i'm fine--but thank you.
BOB: george, you're probably wondering why i asked if i could come over today ...
BOB: i'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town. you know what i mean by "changes"?
GEORGE: "changes."
BOB: "changes." and it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. it's little things. did you hear about bill miller?
GEORGE: no. what?
BOB: wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
GEORGE: one of those ... big beds?
GEORGE: oh my gosh. what's he gonna to do?
BOB: i really don't know. ben miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
GEORGE: ... how?
BIG BOB: said he didn't want to do it anymore. just took off his apron in the middle of an order. mrs. thompson had her groceries spread all over the counter ... took 'em four hours to sort the whole thing out.
GEORGE: holy cow.
BIG BOB: george, everyone likes you.
GEORGE: oh well ...
BOB: no. they do. and it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... they respect you ...
GEORGE: thank you very much.
BOB: and it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. if you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
GEORGE: no. of course not.
BOB: and that's why i want you to be on the pleasantville chamber of commerce.
GEORGE: oh my gosh. i hardly know what to say.
BOB: why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
GEORGE: oh sure ... you bet. betty ...
BETTY ...: still no answer.

DAVID: are you okay? 
DAVID: are you alright?

BETTY: what am i going to do? 
DAVID: it's okay. it's alright.
BETTY: i can't go out there. how can i go out there?
BETTY: look at me ...

DAVID: have you got any make up? 
BETTY: in my handbag.
DAVID: okay--first we'll dry you out a little.

BETTY: what? 
BETTY: does it look okay?
DAVID: looks just like it did.
BETTY: and they won't be able to tell?
DAVID: wait.
BETTY: what?
DAVID: it's fine.
BETTY: thank you.
DAVID: sure.

MR. JOHNSON: oh, hi. 
DAVID: hi.
MR. JOHNSON: aren't you a little early?
DAVID: i brought you something ... from the library.

DAVID: it's an art book. 
MR. JOHNSON: oh my gosh, bud ...
DAVID: open it.
DAVID: i just thought since you liked painting it might help to ...

MR. JOHNSON: mmmmgh ... 
WIDER. SODA SHOP.: they sit like that for a beat.
MR. JOHNSON: it's beautiful, bud ...
DAVID: what's wrong?
MR. JOHNSON: i'll never be able to do that.
DAVID: oh, well--you're just starting out.
MR. JOHNSON: no, that's not it.
MR. JOHNSON: where am i going to see colors like that?

MR. JOHNSON: must be awfully lucky to see colors like that. i bet they don't even know how lucky they are. 
CLOSE UP. DAVID.: he just stares for a second.

DAVID: hi. 
MARGARET: oh ... hi.
DAVID: look, i probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
DAVID: it's just that my folks are gonna stay home and they said i could use their car. ... you want to go out with me tonight?
MARGARET: sure ... where would we go?
DAVID: ... lover's lane?

DAVID: "oh when the saints ... go marching in ..." 
MAN'S VOICE: bud ...
MAN'S VOICE: david ...

DICK VAN DYKE: hello there. 
DAVID: ... hi.
DICK VAN DYKE: well c'mere, young fella.
DICK VAN DYKE: you know i've been thinkin' ... i might have been a little "hasty" the other day when you asked to come home--just took me by such surprise, ya know--ha ha ...
DICK VAN DYKE: so even though i can't make any promises, well--i figured if you asked me real nice--i might just be willing to talk about it again.
DAVID: i can't.
DICK VAN DYKE: what?
DAVID: talk about it. right now, i mean. i got to ... um ...
DICK VAN DYKE: bud--i thought you wanted to come home.
DAVID: oh ... i do. yeah. it's just that i told my "dad" i'd clean out the rain gutters and mr. johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
DICK VAN DYKE: i'll be honest with you bud. i'm getting sorta concerned about what i'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
DAVID: re-runs?
DICK VAN DYKE: like when margaret henderson makes her cookies for whitey. ... those aren't your cookies bud.
DAVID: oh, i know they're not. but i mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
DICK VAN DYKE: excuse me?
DAVID: well they're not just cookies. i mean, they're great cookies ... look, i'd love to get into this whole thing but i'm really running late. why don't we hook up tomorrow?

JENNIFER: what's wrong? 
DAVID: nothing.
JENNIFER: nothing?
DAVID: listen ...
DAVID: you're reading?
JENNIFER: yeah. can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
JENNIFER: d.h. lawrence. you ever heard of him?
DAVID: ... yeah.
JENNIFER: seemed kinda sexy. look. i read 35 pages.
DAVID: that's great.
JENNIFER: so what is it?
DAVID: well ... i just ... can i ask you a question?
JENNIFER: sure.
DAVID: remember when you told me that lisa rosenberg liked me?
JENNIFER: yeah ...
DAVID: well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
JENNIFER: no. she really liked you.
DAVID: you weren't playing a joke? she woulda gone out with me?
JENNIFER: gone out with you. she woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
DAVID: wow.
JENNIFER: can i ask you a question?
DAVID: yes.
JENNIFER: how come i'm still in black and white?
DAVID: what?
JENNIFER: well i've had like ten times as much as these girls and i'm still like this. they have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
DAVID: oh, i don't know. maybe ... ... it's not just the ...
JENNIFER: what?
JENNIFER: no, it's not just the sex, is it?

MARGARET: um ... you gotta turn off main street. 
DAVID: oh ... right.

DAVID: what's that smell? 
MARGARET: aren't these great?

MR. JOHNSON: oh, hi ... 
BETTY: i'm sorry ...
MR. JOHNSON: no, no ... come on in.

BETTY: i just thought ... it's beautiful. 
MR. JOHNSON: thanks.
MR. JOHNSON: i was just trying to do one of these "still lifes."

MR. JOHNSON: having kind of a tough time. 
BETTY: i think it looks nice.
MR. JOHNSON: well ...
BETTY: oh my ...

MR. JOHNSON: here. look at this. 
BETTY: where'd you get this?
MR. JOHNSON: bud brought it to me.
BETTY: bud?
MR. JOHNSON: here's my favorite.

MR. JOHNSON: what do you think? 
MR. JOHNSON: isn't it great how she's resting like that?
BETTY: she's crying.
WIDER.: mr. johnson looks down at the painting.
MR. JOHNSON: what?
BETTY: she's crying.
MR. JOHNSON: no she's not.
BETTY: yes she is.

MR. JOHNSON: wait ... 
BETTY: i've got to go ...
MR. JOHNSON: it's alright.
MR. JOHNSON: it's alright. let me see.
BETTY: no ...
MR. JOHNSON: it's beautiful.

MR. JOHNSON: ... it's beautiful. 
MR. JOHNSON: you shouldn't cover that up.

BIFF: mary sue--c'mon ... 
JENNIFER: what are you doing?
BIFF: it's six-thirty ...
JENNIFER: so.
BIFF: we were gonna ... you know ...
JENNIFER: oh. i can't.
BIFF: why not?
JENNIFER: i'm busy.
BIFF: with what?

DAVID: mmmmgh. 
MARGARET: do they have those ... where you come from?
DAVID: yeah ... i guess. i don't know.
MARGARET: you don't know?
MARGARET: so what's it like?
DAVID: what?
MARGARET: out there.
DAVID: oh. don't know ... it's different.
MARGARET: how?
DAVID: well it's louder ... and scarier i guess ... and ... and a lot more dangerous ...
MARGARET: sounds fantastic. you know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes. she giggles. david looks at her in amazement.
MARGARET: do they have an ocean? i've heard about the ocean.
DAVID: yeah.
MARGARET: what's that like?
DAVID: well it's big. and it's blue ... ... it's really really blue.
MARGARET: mmmm.
MARGARET: you want some berries?
DAVID: hunh?

MARGARET: i picked them myself. they grow wild up here. mmm. so sweet. 
DAVID: they just grow like that?
MARGARET: here.

GEORGE: honey--i'm home. 
GEORGE: honey--i'm home ...

BETTY: what is that? 
MR. JOHNSON: i don't know.

MARGARET: what's going on? 
DAVID: rain.
MARGARET: real rain?
DAVID: yeah ... you don't have rain either?
DAVID: right. of course you don't ...
MARGARET: what do we do?
DAVID: we'll just put up the top.
MARGARET: what top?
DAVID: it's fine. come on.
DAVID: it's alright. there's nothing to be afraid of.

GEORGE: honey, i'm home ... 
GEORGE: where's my dinner?
KITCHEN.: he crosses into the darkness ...
GEORGE: where's my dinner ...

BOB: are you alright? what is it? 
GEORGE: rain.
BOB: real rain?
BOB: oh my ...
BOB: ... we had no idea. burt was rolling a 250 and ... are you alright?
BOB: what happened?
GEORGE: well, i ... i came home like i always do, and i came in the front door. and i took off my coat. and i put down my briefcase and i said "honey. i'm home."
ANGLE. MEN.: they all nod in recognition.

GEORGE: ... only no one was there. 
GEORGE: so i went into the kitchen and i yelled it again. "honey--i'm home." but there was no one there either. no wife. no lights. no dinner.
GEORGE: so i went to the oven--you know-- because i thought maybe she had made me one of those "tv dinners ..."
GEORGE: but she hadn't. she was gone.
BOB: ... it's gonna be fine george.
GUS: what do we do bob?
BOB: well--we'll be safe for now--thank goodness we're in a bowling alley-- but if george here doesn't get his dinner, any one of us could be next. it could be you gus, or you burt, or even you phil ...
BOB: ... that's real rain out there gentlemen. this isn't some little "virus" that's going to "clear up on it's own." there's something happening to our town and i think we can all see where it comes from.
BOB: we're gonna need a town meeting. phil, how fast can you turn around a leaflet in your print shop?
PHIL: couple of hours.
BOB: gus, why don't you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks ...
BOB: and the first thing you're gonna do is get a cup of hot cocoa and a nice dry bowling shirt.

MR. JOHNSON: you can't go out there. 
BETTY: but i really should get home.
MR. JOHNSON: but you can't go out there.
BETTY: sounds nice ... once you get used to it.
MR. JOHNSON: yeah. it does.
BETTY: like a drum.
MR. JOHNSON: yeah.

BETTY: i told you where i was. 
GEORGE: all night?
BETTY: i got caught in the storm. you were gone all night too.
GEORGE: i was in a bowling-alley.
GEORGE: look. let's just forget about it.
BETTY: i told you, george. i'm not going.
GEORGE: sure you are.
BETTY: no i'm not.
BETTY: look at me george. that meeting's not for me. look at my face.
GEORGE: it's fine. you'll put on some make up and ...
BETTY: i don't want to put on some make up ... george's eyes widen. it's a watershed moment.
GEORGE: it goes away ... it'll go away.
GEORGE: okay--now you listen to me ... you're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
BETTY: no i'm not sweetie.
BETTY: ... there's a meatloaf in the fridge. you just put it in the oven and turn this little up to three-fifty. if you put the pie in forty minutes later, it'll be hot in time for dessert.
BETTY: i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ... i'm gonna go now.
GEORGE: where are you gonna go?
BETTY: i'm gonna go now.
GEORGE: betty, don't go out there like that! they'll see you! they'll see you!
GEORGE: betty, come back here!

SHOT. BOB.: he holds up a pair of bright red boxer shorts. 
BOB: jane davidson found these in her son's laundry basket.
BOB: this is from mary petersen's front porch. she found one last week. there were two more this morning ...

DAVID: i got you something. 
MARGARET: it's beautiful. where'd you get it?
DAVID: it was a prop for the school play ...
MARGARET: can i open it?
DAVID: sure ...

DRIVER: hello bud ... 
DAVID: hello whitey.
WHITEY: hello margaret.
MARGARET: hello whitey ...
WHITEY: hey bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now?
DAVID: no reason. how come you're not?
WHITEY: oh. we're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it. see.
WHITEY: no reason hunh ... see i thought maybe it was cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend.
DAVID: why don't you guys just get the out of here.
WHITEY: oh, okay, bud. we'll do that.
DAVID: it's fine ... it doesn't mean anything.

WOMAN: ed mcfadden's got a blue front door. 
ED MCFADDEN: it's always been blue!
WOMAN: not that blue!
MAN: there's a big tree turning orange in joe baker's front yard!

BOB: obviously certain "changes" have been happening. up until now, things in pleasantville have always been-- well ... "pleasant." and, recently, certain things have become ... "un-pleasant." now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant, from the things that are "un-pleasant." 
BOB: george, why don't you and burt take the lead on this. why don't you put together kind of an "un-pleasant" activities committee ...

DICK VAN DYKE: bud ... 
DICK VAN DYKE: i want a word with you ...
DAVID: oh--well ...

DICK VAN DYKE: what the do you think you're doing! 
DAVID: what do you mean?
DICK VAN DYKE: what do i mean! you think this is a toy? you think it's your own little coloring book ...
DAVID: look--it just sort of "happened" ...
DICK VAN DYKE: a deluge doesn't just "happen." bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ... you burned down an elm tree for christ's sake ...
DAVID: i had nothing to do with that.
DICK VAN DYKE: oh. i'm sorry--refresh my memory. what episode does the happen in, again?
DAVID: look ...
DICK VAN DYKE: it was a gift bud. it was so special. you liked these things as much as i did, remember: warm smells in the family kitchen? a smile from a stranger? you know how rare that is?
DAVID: ... only if they mean it.

DAVID: i didn't do anything wrong. 
DICK VAN DYKE: oh no? let me show you something!

DICK VAN DYKE: where's the remote control i gave you? 
DAVID: why?
DICK VAN DYKE: because you're coming home. i'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
DAVID: no you're not.

DAVID: i'm going to leave now. 
DICK VAN DYKE: you're not going anywhere. you're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody happy again!!!
DICK VAN DYKE: don't make me get rough with you!

DAVID: get out of here! 
DIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY.: david moves up to her gently.
DAVID: are you alright?
DAVID: what?

DAVID: oh my 
DAVID: are you alright? are you okay?

MARGARET: where are they? 
DAVID: i'm not sure.

JENNIFER: don't! just let go. 
BIFF: it's better, mary sue.
JENNIFER: i said, no!

DAVID: hello? 
MR. JOHNSON: just thought i'd try to tidy it up a bit.
MR. JOHNSON: it's okay. once we sweep it up it'll be alright again ...
DAVID: well he's right. come on. let's turn these booths back up. "mary sue", why don't you help me slide this in front of the door. we'll be okay in here.

BOB: this is not the answer people. 
BOB: no matter how upset we may get, or how frustrated we may be, we're not gonna solve our problems out in the street. it's just the wrong way to do it. we have to have a "code of conduct" we can all agree to live by.
BOB: now, i asked george and burt here to sketch out some ideas-and i think they've done a terrific job. if we all agree on these then we can take a vote and i think we'll start to move in the right direction.
ANGLE. CROWD.: they murmur and nod ...
BOB: reading from the
CODE OF CONDUCT"): "one: all public disruption and acts of vandalism are to cease immediately."

LISA ANNE: "courteous and pleasant manner." that doesn't sound too bad. 
DAVID: "three: the area commonly known as lover's lane as well as the pleasantville public library shall be closed until further notice." this sends a murmur amongst the kids.
DAVID: "four: the only permissible recorded music shall be the following: pat boone, johnny mathis, perry como, jack jones, the marches of john phillips souza or the star spangled banner. in no event shall any music be tolerated that is not of a temperate or "pleasant" nature."
VARIOUS KIDS: "oh my gosh ... no ..." david holds up his hand.
DAVID: "five: there shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind."
DAVID: "six: no bedframe or mattress may be sold measuring more than 38 inches wide." "seven: the only permissible exterior paint colors shall be black, white or gray, despite the recent availability of certain alternatives."
DAVID: "eight: all elementary and high school curriculums shall teach the "non-changist" view of history-- emphasizing "continuity" over "alteration." wow.

BOY: hey. this thing works. 
BUDDY HOLLY: well all the things that you say and do make me want to be with you-oo-oo ...
LISA ANNE: turn that off!
DAVID: sure you are.

DAVID: it's okay. we'll get you a new one. 
MR. JOHNSON: i don't know what i'd do if i couldn't paint anymore bud. i just don't know what i'd do ...

BOB: did you do this? 
DAVID: yes i did.
BOB: do you know that it's illegal?
DAVID: yes i do.

BOB: you're not allowed to do this! i could arrest you for this. 
DAVID: still doesn't make it right.
BOB: dan! arrest them!
DAN: um ... i don't know how to do that, bob.
BOB: what do you mean!?
DAN: well, i never had to do it before.
BOB: you put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
DAN: oh. guess i could do that, then.
DAVID: c'mere, dan. i'll help you.

DICK VAN DYKE: hope you're proud of yourself. 
DAVID: i am actually ... glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
DICK VAN DYKE: okay, let's cut the and get right to it. where's that remote control?
DAVID: why?
DICK VAN DYKE: because you're coming home.
DAVID: why don't you just take me back without it?
DICK VAN DYKE: oh. you're a smart little aren't you? it's kind of like a restricted ticket. you gotta leave the same way you came.
DAVID: so ... i guess as long as i'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. we could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
DICK VAN DYKE: just gimme the remote!
DAVID: i'm sorry. i can't do that.
DICK VAN DYKE: i don't know what went wrong. you answered every question. you knew every detail. the senior prom ... mcintire's department store. we had all the same warm memories: sock hops. the church social ...
DAVID: they weren't my memories. i borrowed them. it's no good when you borrow them.
DICK VAN DYKE: how long do you think you've been here?
DAVID: i don't know ... three, four weeks.
DICK VAN DYKE: much less than that. an hour and a half.
DICK VAN DYKE: see--and this is really great-- the show was on for what--half an hour a week? so that means for every week that goes by in pleasantville, only half an hour goes by in the real world.
DICK VAN DYKE: now buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. and if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. well, not forever--lemme think ... five year sentence ... carry the three ... that comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
DAVID: i'm going on trial tomorrow?
DICK VAN DYKE: this is tv pal. they don't fool around.
DAVID: there's worse places.
DICK VAN DYKE: oh sure. for the first hundred years. then it starts to get a little monotonous. sleep well.

BOB: bud parker and william johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the pleasantville code of conduct and laws of common decency. do you admit that on the night of may 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following forbidden colors to the pleasantville town hall: red, pink, vermillion, puce, chartreuse, umber, blue, aqua, ox blood, green, peach, crimson, yellow, olive and magenta. 
DAVID: um ... yes i do. where's our lawyer?
BOB: we prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. i don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
BOB: do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
DAVID: well--it was dark out ...
BOB: good. do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
DAVID: it was accessible to everyone.
BOB: very well. let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges. he looks directly at them for the first time.
BOB: do you have anything to say in your defense?

MR. JOHNSON: i didn`t mean to hurt anybody. i just have to paint ... i need to. 
DAVID: i think i've got something to say.
BOB: very well ...
DAVID: i think i know why you're doing this. i mean, i understand why you're doing this. i used to feel the same way. i used to want this place to stay just the way it was. i never wanted it to change ...
DAVID: but nothing stays the same. you get things, and you lose things, and that's the good part and the bad part--but you can't have a good part without a bad part.
DAVID: it's like the basketball team.
BOB: the basketball team?
DAVID: sure. everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
DAVID: wouldn't it feel better than when they used to win all the time?
DAVID: see, i know you want it to stay "pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like silly ... or ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ... and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them. look at those faces back there. they're no different than you are. they just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
BOB: okay--that's enough!
DAVID: i thought i was allowed to defend myself.
BOB: you're not allowed to lie.
DAVID: i'm not lying ... here i'll show you.
DAVID: mr. simpson ...
MR. SIMPSON: yes.
DAVID: what color is that hedge of yours?
MR. SIMPSON: green.
DAVID: no, not that hedge. the other one.
MR. SIMPSON: the other one?
DAVID: the one in your mind. the one that you see on a bright cold morning. the one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
DAVID: what color is that hedge?

THE AUDIENCE: "no ... let him finish ... go on ..." 
DAVID: alright. dad ...

GEORGE: yes bud. 
DAVID: don't you miss her?

DAVID: i mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ... 
DAVID: maybe you can't even describe it. maybe you only know it when it's gone. maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. you might even call it "love."
BIG BOB: okay, that's it!!!
DAVID: now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
DAVID: don't you wish you could tell her that?

DAVID: but see that's just the point. it can't stop at once. because it's in you. and you can't stop something that's in you. 
BOB: it's not in me.
DAVID: oh sure it is.
BOB: no it isn't.
DAVID: what do you want to do to me right now?
DAVID: c'mon. everyone's turning colors. kids are making out in the street. no one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
BIG BOB: that's not going to happen!
DAVID: but it could happen.
BIG BOB: no it couldn't!

DAVID: are you sure? 
JENNIFER: i told you. i'm like positive.
DAVID: this thing works. we could go home right now.
JENNIFER: i'm not ready yet. i gotta do this for a little while.

JENNIFER: besides. you think there's like a chance i'm gonna get into college back there? 
DAVID: honestly ... no.
DAVID: you got the admissions letter.
JENNIFER: right here.
DAVID: and you're sure about this?
JENNIFER: i've done the thing, david. it's really kinda old.
DAVID: i'll come back and check on you in a month.
JENNIFER: you're like the coolest brother in the world.

MARGARET: you're gonna forget about me. 
DAVID: no i won't. i swear.
MARGARET: i like calling you david.
DAVID: i like it too.

MR. JOHNSON: well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was? 
DAVID: you're gonna keep painting aren't you?
DAVID: well ...
MR. JOHNSON: oh. i've got something for you.

DAVID: it's beautiful. 
MR. JOHNSON: just a little--you know.

BETTY: i made you these for the trip.
