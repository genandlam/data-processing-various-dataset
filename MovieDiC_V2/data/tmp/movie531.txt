BRAD: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 73. miguel shakes his head, no. after a beat...
MIGUEL: if you no play baseball... what you do?

SALVADOR: yo! sugar!
MIGUEL: holy how'd you get here?
SALVADOR: on a airplane, motherfucker.

STU: welcome to america, kid.
MIGUEL: just do me a favor... don't give it away to the first white girl you meet.
MIGUEL: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 78.

HELEN: you started dropping your arm in the third. i think that was your problem. 
EARL: he lost control of his breaking pitches and they just zeroed in on the fastball, which isn't as fast as it used to be.
HELEN: earl...
EARL: don't matter, he can't understand anyway. miguel stares out the window in the backseat.

STU: i know it's hard when you don't perform up to your own expectations for yourself. but you need to learn self- control. can you understand what i'm saying? you need to learn that your actions have consequences. so we're gonna take the cost of the water unit you broke out of your next check... that's not something your family back home's gonna be too proud of... is it? 
STU: so you should think real hard next time. think about channeling that frustration you're feeling onto the field. into practice. channel it into working harder--
MIGUEL: --i am work hard! everyday i work hard.
STU: so work harder, goddamnit! you think you're the only one on this team works hard?
STU: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 80.
MIGUEL: i don't understand you. you speak too fast. i just don't understand!
STU: look, you may think i don't know what you're going through, but i do. i've been on the mound; i've played through pain. i've been in your exact situation before. i've struggled too... i've...

JEFF: listen, your first time, take a half. okay? no more. you gotta ease into it. half. 
JEFF: and anyone finds these, you didn't get them from me, okay?
SALVADOR: what's up?
JEFF: what's up, sal?
SALVADOR: did you hear i made player of the week?
SALVADOR: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 81.
MIGUEL: you told me last night.
SALVADOR: which one do you use?
MIGUEL: that one.
SALVADOR: thanks.

JACK JEFFERIES: miguel santos appears to be in top form tonight, striking out two of three in the first. i don't want to jinx it, but this sure looks like the santos we knew earlier this season. 
JACK JEFFERIES: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 82.

JACK JEFFERIES: top of the fifth and santos is showing some control issues. not sure what's going on down there, but he seems to be talking to himself.

STU: hardy! don't wander off; i gotta talk to you about that accountant...
STU: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 85.

STU: so, um, anyway, i'm bumping sal into your slot in the rotation. i'd like to see how you handle a relief spot. 
JACK JEFFERIES: moving up from relief, torres makes his third start for the swing. i tell ya, this lanky kid from the dominican republic has surprised us all with his unique delivery and precision. reminds me of a young pedro martinez... hey there bees fans, don't forget, closing night is approaching fast and tickets are selling out. so pick yours up at the box office today...

HELEN: oh, honey, you don't have to do that. 
MIGUEL: no problem. i want to help.
