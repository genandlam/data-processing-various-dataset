speaker1: yes. little. secondaria?
speaker2: high school?
speaker1: yes. a little of... high school. but i sign when i have sixteen years.
speaker2: you signed at sixteen? wow. so you didn't finish school?
speaker2: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 73. miguel shakes his head, no. after a beat...
speaker1: if you no play baseball... what you do?
speaker2: um... it's hard to say for sure, but i like history, so i'd probably go to grad school... maybe teach someday.
speaker3: brad! we're up for b.p. let's go.

speaker1: these are grandma's from the other night.

speaker1: there was an injury to the wichita right-fielder. they called up brad this morning... he left you this... stu hands miguel an old paperback book. 
speaker2: yo! sugar!
speaker3: holy how'd you get here?
speaker2: on a airplane, motherfucker.
speaker1: great, you guys know each other. sal's our new middle-relief man. throws a nasty cutter. you could learn a thing or two from him, santos...
speaker3: okay.
speaker2: what he say?
speaker2: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 76.
speaker3: don't worry about it... good to see you.
speaker2: good to see you, too, sugar. i'm a little nervous.
speaker3: look, just remember... it's the same game we played back home. same rules, different place. just have fun. it's only a game.

speaker1: santos allows his second homerun of the game. first night off the dl, and not looking so sharp. 
speaker2: ...stu is scribbling on his scorecard.
speaker1: sutton makes the call to pull santos here in the 4th, bringing in rookie reliever, salvador torres for his bridgetown debut.
speaker1: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 77.
speaker3: strike!
speaker3: strike two!
speaker3: strike three!

speaker1: a stellar debut for torres, who records the final out, baffling josh lansford with a nasty side-armed cutter. 
speaker2: welcome to america, kid.
speaker3: just do me a favor... don't give it away to the first white girl you meet.
speaker3: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 78.

speaker1: you started dropping your arm in the third. i think that was your problem. 
speaker2: he lost control of his breaking pitches and they just zeroed in on the fastball, which isn't as fast as it used to be.
speaker1: earl...
speaker2: don't matter, he can't understand anyway. miguel stares out the window in the backseat.

speaker1: i know it's hard when you don't perform up to your own expectations for yourself. but you need to learn self- control. can you understand what i'm saying? you need to learn that your actions have consequences. so we're gonna take the cost of the water unit you broke out of your next check... that's not something your family back home's gonna be too proud of... is it? 
speaker1: so you should think real hard next time. think about channeling that frustration you're feeling onto the field. into practice. channel it into working harder--
speaker2: --i am work hard! everyday i work hard.
speaker1: so work harder, goddamnit! you think you're the only one on this team works hard?
speaker1: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 80.
speaker2: i don't understand you. you speak too fast. i just don't understand!
speaker1: look, you may think i don't know what you're going through, but i do. i've been on the mound; i've played through pain. i've been in your exact situation before. i've struggled too... i've...

speaker1: listen, your first time, take a half. okay? no more. you gotta ease into it. half. 
speaker1: and anyone finds these, you didn't get them from me, okay?
speaker2: what's up?
speaker1: what's up, sal?
speaker2: did you hear i made player of the week?
speaker2: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 81.
speaker3: you told me last night.
speaker2: which one do you use?
speaker3: that one.
speaker2: thanks.

speaker1: miguel santos appears to be in top form tonight, striking out two of three in the first. i don't want to jinx it, but this sure looks like the santos we knew earlier this season. 
speaker1: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 82.

speaker1: top of the fifth and santos is showing some control issues. not sure what's going on down there, but he seems to be talking to himself. 
speaker2: don't worry about it. you're all good. just relax. throw strikes. they can't touch you. just throw strikes.
speaker2: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 83. miguel nods. orlando goes back behind the plate.

speaker1: hardy! don't wander off; i gotta talk to you about that accountant...
speaker1: official shooting script as of 10/22/07 85.

speaker1: so, um, anyway, i'm bumping sal into your slot in the rotation. i'd like to see how you handle a relief spot. 
speaker2: moving up from relief, torres makes his third start for the swing. i tell ya, this lanky kid from the dominican republic has surprised us all with his unique delivery and precision. reminds me of a young pedro martinez... hey there bees fans, don't forget, closing night is approaching fast and tickets are selling out. so pick yours up at the box office today...

speaker2: no problem. i want to help.
