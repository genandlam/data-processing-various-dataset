speaker1: i don't want to be just theoretically gay, i want to do something about it.
speaker1: ...i want to do something about it...
speaker1: ...i want to do something about it.

speaker1: since i came out to my father, he never speaks to me. that's why i've been always attracted to older men. 
speaker2: he found an out gay priest to guide him spiritually. he saw a therapist for the first time. he joined the primetimers. movie night.

speaker1: look, its lonely out here, so you'd better learn how to talk with me. 
speaker2: while i understand up to 150 words - i don't talk.
speaker1: i know. i know.

speaker1: oliver! please help me with all these ropes. 
speaker2: pop, pop, stop -- you're gonna hurt yourself.

speaker2: i got the moves... you've got the skills...

speaker1: you remember when oliver was funny? and he could actually, like, talk, in complete sentences? 
speaker2: funny? funny? i don't think so fun maybe, but not funny unless, like, serious is funny. then he's' hilarious.
speaker2: but, lovable. you are very lovable.

speaker2: no? arthur, sit!
speaker2: he's so cute. shake!

speaker2: oh, you're being a therapist!
speaker1: thanks, yeah. very good.

speaker1: well, i didn't ask for this. who would ask for this? this color. this nose. this cheek, this chin. you know, this is my life. this isn't a story. this isn't a joke... 
speaker2: yeah.

speaker2: oh, i was just- i was gonna take a break, actually.
speaker3: well then your father.
speaker3: i don't understand. you can't talk? is it a mental problem? do you need analysis?
speaker3: that's a physical problem.

speaker1: i was doing such a good job of hiding it. how could you tell? 
speaker1: clearly, i'm gonna need a drink. you?
speaker1: you, stay here, yeah?

speaker1: no, its just not a natural color for a chicken. 
speaker2: no.

speaker2: young gay men don't go for older gay men.
speaker2: you have it easy.

speaker1: sorry. 
speaker2: can we just sleep?
speaker1: sure, sure.

speaker1: oliver. 
speaker1: how long are you here when you get back?
speaker1: a year?
speaker1: a month? right. and then?...
speaker1: you're filming here. acting.

speaker1: and after?... 
speaker1: just somewhere else. where?
speaker1: yes.

speaker1: pop, you get so much mail. 
speaker2: hal, its remarkable how well you've recovered from being on the ventilator.

speaker1: but...? 
speaker2: the bronchoscopy revealed a mass about the size of a quarter. it is located in your lower right lung.
speaker2: i'm afraid the biopsy showed it's cancerous.
speaker1: uh-huh. i see.
speaker2: it appears to have spread... to the large hilar lymph nodes in your chest and liver.

speaker1: do you have any questions? 
speaker2: no. thank you.
speaker3: i'm sorry.
speaker2: well, let's not rush out and tell everyone.
speaker3: andy?
speaker2: no need to get him up a tree.
speaker2: can you read me something?

speaker1: yeah, he's fine. he sleeps on your bed. 
speaker2: but is he eating?

speaker1: yeah, yeah, he's eating. 
speaker2: oh i worry so much about--
speaker2: oh here we are...

speaker1: a slug. 
speaker2: oh, andy, you can't bring that kind of thing in here.
speaker1: oh i can look.
speaker2: you.
speaker2: it's time for inspection...
speaker3: hello, mr. fields.
speaker2: hello.
speaker1: i'm andy. hal's boyfriend
speaker3: i'm sophia.
speaker1: you know, i have the right to be here as much as anyone else.
speaker2: go take a walk. calm yourself.

speaker1: what was all that? 
speaker2: oh, andy hasn't had it easy. be nice to him.
speaker2: andy, where did you get these?

speaker1: guys, guys, this is to us. cheers. 
speaker2: drinking's not allowed in the room.
speaker3: oh, it's not?
speaker4: i'm sorry.
speaker3: no, no, no. she's a wonderful nurse. here's to health care.
speaker5: to health care!

speaker1: what did you do with my father? he was so polite. 
speaker2: oh, i invited him - but he never returns my calls.

speaker1: two, four, six, eight... 
speaker2: that's it? that's all you're gonna tell me?
speaker1: i'm gonna meet her at her hotel again. you happy?
speaker2: yeah, i'm very happy. are you happy?
speaker1: here's eight...
speaker1: we haven't actually had a conversation yet, so, you know...

speaker1: you're thinking about her all the time. 
speaker2: and you know that because?
speaker1: because you're not talking about it. i know you.
speaker2: it's true. it's embarrassing. i'm 38 and falling for a girl again...

speaker1: it's like i lost the instructions or i, i never had them... 
speaker2: where's pop?
speaker3: at the museum.
speaker2: is something wrong with you guys?
speaker3: what're you, in the fbi?
speaker2: no.
speaker3: the cia?
speaker2: no.

speaker1: kgb? sla? pta? bmw? 
speaker1: there is nothing wrong with me and pop.
speaker1: c'mon.
speaker1: when you feel bad, you go into a room and scream - loud as you want, for a minute or two, then it's out of you. it's called catharsis.

speaker1: i don't feel like screaming... 
speaker2: you will...

speaker1: what the is that? 
speaker2: l-e-it, elliot
speaker1: well, that's ridiculous.
speaker2: i know! you're not very supportive.
speaker1: well, its just copying something someone did, like, 30 years ago in the bronx.
speaker2: well yeah. i'm part of a tradition of civil disobedience, something bigger than myself.

speaker1: how does it work? 
speaker2: shake it, you have to shake it.
speaker3: oliver runs back to the car, exhilarated.
speaker2: what was that?
speaker1: historical consciousness... you know, something bigger than myself.
speaker1: let's do it again. elliott drives off. oliver's coming to life.

speaker1: he's sweet. he misses your dad. 
speaker2: maybe we, we could, um, just talk for a second.
speaker1: right.
speaker1: well, my name is anna. you're worried you can't trust me because you don't know who i am. i get it. that makes sense to me.

speaker1: oliver, stop it. 
speaker2: this music's old.
speaker1: it's black, black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most, them and the jews.
speaker1: in my next life i'm gonna marry a good hot blooded jew - someone full of emotion.
speaker2: i'm jewish right?
speaker3: you're a quarter, i'm a half, your father's none. he has the least emotions, you'll have more emotions than him, but i'll have the most emotions.

speaker1: excuse me mrs. fields.... 
speaker2: what? you're not allowed to interact with the art?
speaker1: it's just that...
speaker3: c'mon.
speaker2: you too? you like being a good citizen?
speaker3: no.

speaker1: can you toss me my camisole. 
speaker1: no, my camisole.
speaker2: camisole?
speaker1: you don't know what a camisole is?
speaker2: i was brought up by these animals and they didn't like questions.
speaker2: they were very frowned upon. so i had to guess.
speaker1: you can ask me anything.
speaker2: anything?
speaker2: what's out there?
speaker1: that's a tree.
speaker2: yeah.

speaker1: and cars. 
speaker2: uh-huh.
speaker1: another building like this one.
speaker2: right.
speaker1: people in the building like us. half of them think things will never work out. the other half believe in magic. it's like a war between them.
speaker2: how do you know so much about people?
speaker1: oh. well, you have to learn how to read their faces.
speaker1: for example... here is mad.
speaker1: happy...
speaker1: sometimes its just nothing.
speaker2: oh yeah?
speaker1: this is nothing... and they are good at looking one way and being another way.

speaker1: you don't know me. i like that. 
speaker2: no, that's not true.
speaker1: oh yeah?
speaker2: yeah, you have blonde hair that goes down to about here. you smoke in non-smoking rooms.
speaker2: okay, open your eyes...
speaker1: oh yeah? you drive on the sidewalk. you were raised by animals. sometimes you look very alone, like you just got here.
speaker2: yeah, you see, you don't know me at all.

speaker1: someone flashy walks into your life and you're just gonna fall for it? 
speaker2: are we married yet?
speaker1: no, uh, it doesn't work like that. there are other steps, it's complicated.
speaker2: i hope this feeling lasts.

speaker1: what happened with michelle? 
speaker2: you know... i don't know.
speaker1: she seemed great.
speaker2: she was great.
speaker1: maybe you should take out a personal ad, where you explain your situation?
speaker2: my situation?
speaker1: yeah, i mean, you want to be in a relationship but you can't stay in one.
speaker2: that's your fatherly advice?

speaker1: well, a lot of people use them... i did. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: if andy wasn't going to be monogamous, why should i be?
speaker2: pop.
speaker1: yourself.

speaker1: oh what have you got this time? 
speaker2: it's a green caterpillar.
speaker1: no, no, no, you don't have a green caterpillar.
speaker2: oh yeah i do.

speaker1: hey, you going? 
speaker2: yeah, michael's in town.
speaker1: oh. right.
speaker3: i thought he was your boyfriend?
speaker1: well, at least i'm the number one boyfriend.
speaker3: pop.
speaker1: oh, my stomach.
speaker3: alright, come on. come on.
speaker3: arthur, down.
speaker1: well, let's say, when you were little, you always dreamed of some day getting a lion?

speaker1: and you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and the lion doesn't come. then along comes a giraffe. 
speaker1: you can be alone or you can be with the giraffe.
speaker2: i'd wait for the lion.
speaker1: that's why i worry about you.

speaker1: hey, what did you get? 
speaker1: liv ullman. very serious.
speaker2: and i found this crazy book.
speaker1: that's kind of a classic american thing.
speaker2: maybe we can figure out some classic american things to do.
speaker1: yeah, like page 75?
speaker2: uh-huh.
speaker1: or 75 all the way through, through

speaker1: veronica lake. 
speaker2: oh i love her.
speaker1: she was a pin-up model and a film star... success was short-lived... series of broken marriages... she struggled with mental illness and alcoholism. she died of hepatitis at the age of 53.
speaker2: all these actor stories end sad. i can tell you that already. it's not a good life.
speaker2: so. now i want real mexican food.
speaker2: and i want to try page... 46.

speaker1: no. 
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: really?
speaker2: it's really good.

speaker1: what do you think? 
speaker2: it's so good.
speaker1: it's good? oh, i wasn't sure you'd like it.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: you're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel.
speaker2: i like this place.

speaker1: i used to love hotels. but now i'm always in a new apartment or... in another hotel somewhere. 
speaker2: how do you keep hold of friends...
speaker1: it makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people.
speaker2: you can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people.
speaker1: you are like that? its what you do?
speaker1: so we are the same?

speaker1: oh, did i wake you? yeah. thank you maria. and now that you're here, uh, would you please put those up there? 
speaker2: what are you--? pop. what?
speaker1: i'm reorganizing.
speaker2: prednisone makes you crazy.
speaker1: i'm just not sleepy. i feel great.

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: nothing, you're pretty.
speaker1: no...
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: jewish girls are not pretty. they can be "interesting", or cute, but not pretty.
speaker2: you're kidding right?
speaker1: that's what my mom told me.
speaker2: she did not.
speaker1: no, you're right, this girl at school told me that. and i went home and my mom said, `anna, who told you that?

speaker1: here, pop. 
speaker2: oh,
speaker1: i know, i know. come on.
speaker2: hey, no, no, no. that's the gay pride day stuff. just leave those.
speaker1: alright.
speaker2: and that's for gay book club. you better leave those too.
speaker1: but what about this chair? is it gay?
speaker2: the chair's not gay. obviously.

speaker1: pop, pop, the cord won't go that far. 
speaker2: oh, to with it.
speaker2: oh, hey what's that?
speaker3: now that you're out of the hospital, you'll have to exercise, get you back into shape.
speaker2: that's a great idea.
speaker3: okay, let's try it. i'll, i'll show you how.
speaker2: yeah, later on, i'm gonna make myself some tea.
speaker3: okay, i'll clean it up. it's a little - yech.
speaker2: your mother's vase needs some flowers.

speaker1: you need to tell andy that you're... not well. 
speaker2: you'll tell him, won't you?
speaker1: me?
speaker2: please?

speaker1: hey. 
speaker2: you know that i tried to have with women?
speaker1: yeah?
speaker2: yeah. i wanted you to know i tried, it just, it didn't work.
speaker1: hey, i don't have a problem with gay guys.
speaker2: have you ever had with a man?
speaker1: no.

speaker1: i heard that if a man hasn't had with another man, he's always afraid of gay men. you know, they're a threat. 
speaker2: i don't know andy.
speaker1: i didn't want you to feel threatened, i don't want to have with you. what i do, most people wouldn't even call it sex.
speaker2: okay, okay.
speaker1: hey...
speaker2: i couldn't tell him.
speaker3: that's okay.
speaker2: no it's not. you can't hide this from him. he loves you.
speaker3: for someone with so much relationship advice, you seem awfully alone.

speaker1: don't, don't. 
speaker1: it's my dad.
speaker2: he's that bad?
speaker1: i'll be my dad, you be me.

speaker1: honey? 
speaker2: oui? anna continues to talk in a different voice.
speaker1: c'est toi, cheri?

speaker1: oui papa. 
speaker2: you never call me back.
speaker2: you know, i can't stop thinking about, you know, about it. doing it.
speaker1: doing what?
speaker2: killing myself. you are the only one i can tell that to.
speaker1: you should tell mom about that, not me.
speaker2: you are my girl.
speaker2: now i have to kill you.
speaker1: just as it was going so well.
speaker2: i know. i'm sorry.
speaker1: hey anna?
speaker2: hey oliver?
speaker1: how do you feel about vandalism?

speaker1: you know what? here, give me arthur. we'll just stay here and get arrested. you know, that's good. 
speaker2: you okay?
speaker3: yeah. i'm gonna stay here with my new friend .
speaker2: okay.

speaker1: yeah. 
speaker1: i'm trying to impress you.
speaker2: really?
speaker2: it's working. they kiss.

speaker1: arthur, arthur. i'm sorry. 
speaker2: oh. no problem. no problem. what's with this card?
speaker1: uh, do you mind? oliver swipes the man's key, the door opens.
speaker2: thank you.

speaker1: he looked like your dad? 
speaker2: yeah.
speaker2: somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick.

speaker1: good for him. 
speaker2: oliver continues to tell anna about hal.

speaker1: well, glad you could make it. 
speaker2: i thought i was making dinner?
speaker1: it's movie night.
speaker3: hal, you look wonderful.
speaker1: oh, i'm turning the corner on this thing.

speaker1: he started telling everyone that he was getting better. 
speaker1: why're you telling them you're "turning the corner"?
speaker2: well...
speaker1: you have stage 4 cancer?
speaker2: it's not as bad as it sounds.
speaker1: pop. there is no stage 5.
speaker2: that's not what it means.
speaker1: what does it mean?
speaker2: it just means it's been through 3 other stages.
speaker1: what movie are we watching?
speaker2: "the life of harvey milk." he was the first openly gay politician...
speaker1: yeah i know who harvey milk is.
speaker2: good, good.

speaker1: eventually grew old. he could no longer walk far and he could no longer preach in a loud voice. one day he announced to his apostles that he was departing. the three disciples prayed with him, gave him water, bathed and fed him. after gasping for breath for several days, one morning, just as dawn came, passed away. 
speaker2: you re-wrote jesus' death?
speaker1: it was so violent, we need new stories. oliver goes over and kisses hal on the head.

speaker1: for the first time i saw him really in love. 
speaker2: he sounds amazing. but that must have been crazy for you.

speaker1: i couldn't sleep, i wanted to walk around... 
speaker1: you've lost so much. what if i can't make up for that?
speaker2: if this is too much, then we should just stop.
speaker1: wait, wait.
speaker1: i don't want to stop.

speaker1: ah, you're awake! arthur says it's time to get up, he says he has the day off. 
speaker2: he talks to you too?
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: your english is not so perfect. and he said ten minutes.

speaker1: you okay? you did really well. 
speaker2: yeah, i can't believe that was your first time.
speaker1: you watching all the humans going around and around.
speaker3: excuse me. there's no dogs allowed in the building. you need to remove him from the premises please.

speaker1: if i leave him on his own, he loses all control. 
speaker2: i'm sorry. there's no dogs allowed in the building.
speaker1: yeah, but if i leave him in the car, he cries, he howls. i can't leave him in the car.
speaker3: c'mon, it's her first time!
speaker4: a ca vas! c'est bon!
speaker2: i don't know what she's saying but i don't like it.
speaker1: she is just talking in french. she's saying it's ok, it is such a small dog.
speaker2: you need to remove the dog from the premises or i'm going to have to call the authorities.
speaker1: you're gonna call the authorities?
speaker3: it, steal the skates, just leave.
speaker4: dans ce pays! on ne peut pas amener un chien. on peut rien faire. mais c'est con...

speaker1: he shouldn't do this to you. 
speaker2: even if we don't answer, he's still in here .i go somewhere else, he's still here.
speaker1: your leaving soon?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: i think you should come to my house and move in with me.
speaker2: would you want a strange girl like me?
speaker1: yeah, a lot.
speaker2: do you cook?

speaker1: yes . 
speaker2: i would love that.
speaker1: but now i'm going to have to kill you for sure now.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: cause i'm falling in love with you.
speaker3: anna and i are in a relationship in

speaker1: next one. 
speaker2: lord.
speaker2: here, that means gay pride.
speaker1: yeah, everyone knows that, here.
speaker2: no they don't.
speaker1: everyone knows about that pop.
speaker2: don't be ridiculous.
speaker2: did you know, about me?
speaker1: no, i just thought you and mom weren't in love.
speaker2: we loved each other.
speaker1: but you were gay that whole time.
speaker2: i learned how not to be.
speaker1: for 44 years?
speaker2: i knew i was gay, though, at dinner parties i was looking at the husbands not the wives.

speaker1: what about sex? you guys had sex? 
speaker2: she didn't think i was the greatest lover, but we made do. look, i liked my life, the museum, our house, that's what i wanted.
speaker1: and mom? you wanted mom too right?
speaker2: yes, stop that.
speaker2: she proposed to me you know.
speaker2: i said - look i love you and we're great buddies but you know what i am. and then she says, that doesn't matter. i'll fix that.
speaker3: i thought. oh, i'll try anything.

speaker1: ...generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints. but these things don't matter at all because you are real and you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.'" 
speaker2: andy's moving in.
speaker1: yeah? is that a good idea?
speaker2: just be happy about it.

speaker1: this is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness. 
speaker1: here, this could be your...
speaker1: your gonna need a big cd box.
speaker1: i'm sorry.
speaker2: i'm sorry too. they shake hands and she leaves.
speaker1: well, that went well.
speaker3: are we married yet?

speaker1: this is the living room. 
speaker1: dining room.
speaker1: there are my parents. my mom. hal, georgia, this is anna - anna - hal, georgia.
speaker2: hello.

speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: they go up.

speaker1: you ok? 
speaker2: are you?
speaker3: i couldn't sleep, i didn't want to bug you.
speaker1: i was nervous, and excited. i kept thinking, maybe i'm not so lost.
speaker2: why were you crying yesterday?

speaker1: you okay? 
speaker2: yeah.

speaker1: you seem so unhappy with me. 
speaker2: well are you happy here?
speaker1: maybe i'm not perfect at it. i don't really know what i'm doing... but i want to be here.

speaker1: i don't know anna. i don't think this is what i am supposed to feel like. 
speaker2: okay. i will go back to new york then.

speaker1: hal, you don't need to come in for any more treatments. 
speaker2: have i done something wrong?

speaker1: it's best that you stay home. hospice can help you more now, any more treatments would just -- cause more pain. 
speaker2: i see.
