GARY: hey! do you sell crack? 
GARY: it's cool. i'm only a cop on tv.

GARY: is this crack? 
GARY: do you know how to do it?

GARY: yes, hello. i'm having a medical situation. yes. okay. i don't have a belly button. i do not have a belly button where i should, on my belly. and i'm concerned, because i don't know if that's... 
GARY: can a person live without a belly button? because if you think about it, you're born with one. so if you don't have one, you're unborn and it's really hazy whether you're alive or not. i guess i'm wondering: am i alive? or what if i'm god?
GARY: no, no. i'm totally sober.
GARY: no, i don't think i need an ambulance. i don't seem to be dying any faster than usual. but i should probably go to the hospital, don't you think? yeah, i should.

MARGARET: la la la la la. like you've never done worse. 
MARGARET: okay, yes. he totalled a car. but it was an environmentally friendly car. why doesn't that get reported?
MARGARET: please! he was heartbroken, betrayed. you say you understand but you don't. you can't. you're like a big giant vulcan.

6.: noticing something to her right... 
MARGARET: he's coming. i'll call you later.

MARGARET: hi. margaret. i work for lola. 
GARY: gary.
MARGARET: i know. we need to go out the back.

GARY: are there reporters out front? 
MARGARET: a few. not hugh grant level. more like robert downey, jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like goldilocks. "this bed is just right." i handled episodes two through four for robert. this sort of thing is my specialty.
GARY: what is?
MARGARET: famous don't worry. mama's gonna take good care of you.

PAROLE OFFICER: answer it. 
GARY: hello? yes. yes.
GARY: the weather in toledo is rainy.
PAROLE OFFICER: use your normal voice.
MARGARET: it's computer voice recognition. the system can call you any time day or night. if you don't answer within five rings, the police come and haul your off.
GARY: what if i'm not here?
MARGARET: that's why it's called house arrest. you stay inside your house. he can take direction, i promise.

MARGARET: okay, just so it's said, this house is flammable. 
GARY: i didn't mean to burn down my house.
MARGARET: yeah, i didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but i did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it. this flammable house belongs to one of lola's other fabulous clients, who is currently shooting a pilot in toronto.
GARY: actor?
MARGARET: writer. so for the next six weeks, su casa es su casa. i say, feel free to wear his clothes. he'll probably get a sick thrill of out it. the gays.
GARY: he has dogs?
MARGARET: they're away at summer camp. now, try the bed.
GARY: it's fine.
MARGARET: comfortable?
GARY: sure.

MARGARET: look, gary, i know this has been crazy and stressful. i want you to feel safe. and comfortable. 
GARY: i do.
MARGARET: i'm a fan of yours, you know. your number-one fan.
MARGARET: but if you this up, i will smash your ankles with a sledge hammer.
MARGARET: that wouldn't be comfortable for either of us.

MARGARET: i'll be coming by twice a day to check up on you. i'm the only person who should be coming by. no buddies, no pals, no heroin dealers... 
GARY: i don't do heroin.
MARGARET: yeah, crack is classy. and i'm not buying you porn. there's spray-per- view on cable.
GARY: good. i really wasn't concerned about my career, my family or my future. i just wanted to jack off.

MARGARET: let me see your phone. 
GARY: c'mon! all my numbers are in that.
MARGARET: dial ten digits at random. whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone.
MARGARET: you have my cell number. you have delivery menus. you're fine.
GARY: i guess.

GARY: hello?! yes. yes. 
GARY: nine leopards run through the jungle. i bought two cakes at the store.

MARGARET: poltergeist, and no. maybe they were rats. l.a. is teaming with rats. they live in the palm trees. 
GARY: sure. maybe.
MARGARET: okay. you know i'm a licensed psychotherapist.
GARY: really?
MARGARET: no. i'm a publicist. my job is what other people think of you, not what you think of yourself. so pull your together. i am thisclose to getting christine walsh to do your piece in parade.
GARY: parade? i hate parade.
MARGARET: everyone hates parade. but the people who watch "crime lab," they love their marilyn vos savant. give them a woman of indeterminate age who solves riddles and they are in hee-haw heaven.
GARY: okay.
MARGARET: one heartfelt act of contrition and maybe the showrunner won't kill off your character between seasons.

MARGARET: i swear to if you go batshit on me... 
GARY: i'm not crazy.
MARGARET: exactly. exactly.

WOMAN'S VOICE: sorry! really sorry. 
WOMAN'S VOICE: over here. to your left. right. sorry. right.
SARAH: i'm working on my putting, if you can believe it.
GARY: not really.
SARAH: okay. maybe i was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor. you see, i'm under house arrest, too.
GARY: what did you do?

SARAH: i had with my husband. 
GARY: that's awful.
SARAH: nine months later, i had jaden. that's her over there.
GARY: she's cute.
SARAH: she's sleeping for another... ...seventeen minutes. she keeps to a schedule.
GARY: she sounds really boring.
SARAH: she is.
GARY: you're rich. shouldn't you have a nanny from ecuador?
SARAH: i'm canadian.
GARY: ohhh...
SARAH: i can't work in the u.s. plus, i want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself.
GARY: very canadian.
SARAH: thanks.

SARAH: listen, jaden goes down again at 2:30. maybe i could stop by. 
GARY: i'm pretty sure i'll be here.
SARAH: it's a date.
GARY: is it?
SARAH: oh. i'm sarah, by the way.
GARY: gary.
SARAH: yeah. i know.

SARAH: the best of all possible worlds. 
GARY: okay.
SARAH: voltaire. candide. are you actually reading it?
GARY: i thought i was.
SARAH: sorry i bailed. jaden had a fever.

GARY: ah! how boring of her. 
SARAH: housewarming gift.
GARY: demon liquor.
SARAH: the best part is, i can drink it.
GARY: so did i.

GARY: ... so it's kind of hard to prove that i only meant to burn my ex- girlfriend's stuff, and not the entire house. 
SARAH: yeah. fire's tricky that way.
GARY: how about you? any history of arson?
SARAH: strangely enough...
GARY: i knew it! i could see that little spark.
SARAH: it wasn't arson. probably.
SARAH: okay. when i was a little girl, our house caught on fire.

GARY: oh 
SARAH: i'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms and raced through the burning building, out onto the pavement.
SARAH: i stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames. and when it was all over, i said to myself, "is that all there is to a fire?" is that all there is?
SARAH: is that all there is, is that all there is? if that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. she leans closer.
SARAH: let's break out the booze and have a ball. if that's all there is.
SARAH: is that all there is, is that all there is? if that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. let's break out the booze and have a ball, if that's all there is.

SARAH: i need to... 
GARY: just...
SARAH: my shoes. are here. okay.
SARAH: crap!
GARY: don't worry about it. just...
SARAH: i'm going. bye.

SARAH: goodnight, sweetheart. 
GARY: goodnight.
VOICE: the cat says meow! the pig says oink!
VOICE: the cow says moo! the cow says moo! the cow says moo!
VOICE: the dog says, nine. nine. nine.

GARY: hello. 
GARY: yes. yes. two trains run through the forest.
MALE COMPUTER VOICE: nine. nine. nine. nine.

GARY: you scared the out of... 
GARY: what?
NOELLE: you're hurt.
GARY: i don't speak that. sorry. i don't...
GARY: i'm fine. i'll be fine.
GARY: where are your parents?
GARY: your mom, your dad. where are they?
NOELLE: mom is at the car. where you left her.

NOELLE: you're lost. 
GARY: look, you need to go back, okay? you shouldn't be out here. it's not safe. noelle glances to her left.
GARY: 
GARY: evening, officers.

MARGARET: ...the cops come, they throw your in jail. if you ever try to take it off, the cops come and throw your in jail. and if they ever detect drugs or alcohol in your system... 
GARY: ...the cops come and throw my in jail.
MARGARET: no. i kick your ass. then the cops come and throw your in jail.
GARY: do i still have to answer the phone?
MARGARET: no, i'll be doing that from now on.
GARY: i don't need a babysitter.
MARGARET: despite all evidence to the contrary. don't worry, i'm a cool roomie. who do you think taught affleck how to gamble?
MARGARET: let's never hear that again.

GARY: so the guy was like, "do you know fencing?" and i say, of course. 
MARGARET: lies!
GARY: always. so he says, "foil or epi?"
MARGARET: epã©e.
GARY: i say, i'm about equal in both.
MARGARET: which is true.
GARY: so he tosses me this conan sword and goes after me. i'm just swinging, trying to stay alive.
MARGARET: you cut his ear off?
GARY: just a little. but i got the job.

MARGARET: wait. you were in pirates of the caribbean? 
GARY: yes. no. not the movie, the ride. i was like, "gar! keep both hands inside the boat!" margaret laughs so hard she coughs.

MARGARET: goodnight, fuckface. 
GARY: goodnight, you filthy whore.

MARGARET: it's incredible. 
GARY: i know. whenever i see them, and i always feel like,
MARGARET: ...i was born at the wrong time.
GARY: exactly.

SARAH: where's the warden? 
GARY: groceries.
SARAH: quite the little missus.

GARY: how's jaden? 
SARAH: boring. we haven't had nearly the grand old time you two have been having.
GARY: you've been watching.

SARAH: well. i don't want to meddle in your affairs. 
GARY: my affairs?
SARAH: everyone needs affection. i get it.
GARY: i don't. are you seriously jealous?
SARAH: the opposite. i just want to protect her.
GARY: from what?
SARAH: from you. look at you. you date models. actresses. tennis players.
GARY: yeah.
SARAH: on a scale of one to ten, you belong with the nines. we both know you won't settle for less.

MARGARET: what are "the nines?" 
GARY: what?

MARGARET: "look for the nines." 
GARY: it's not mine.
MARGARET: it's your handwriting.
GARY: i didn't write it.
MARGARET: okay.
MARGARET: all-ee-all-ee-all-come-free.
GARY: what?
MARGARET: nothing.
GARY: seriously, what?
MARGARET: nothing. i thought you were...forget it. done. sorry.

MARGARET: yhello? hi. what?! i have to take this. 
MARGARET: well, who thought it was a good idea letting courtney into a pottery shop?

MARGARET,: who doesn't look pleased. 
MARGARET: i know who you are.
SARAH: really.
MARGARET: i know what you are. and if you come near him again...
SARAH: you'll what?
SARAH: what are you going to do, m...
SARAH: sorry, what's he calling you?
MARGARET: margaret.
SARAH: i like that. "margaret." classic.
MARGARET: why can't you just leave him alone?
SARAH: alone? he's an actor. if nobody's watching him, he doesn't really exist. and for the record, i'm not the one deceiving him.

MARGARET: goodnight, ratface. 
GARY: goodnight.

SARAH: hey neighbor. 
GARY: hi.

SARAH: sorry for the psychotic episode. 
GARY: okay.
SARAH: are you alright? you look a little beautiful mind-ish.
GARY: how many times should the number nine come up? probablistically?
SARAH: probablistically?
GARY: you know what i mean.
SARAH: one time out of ten.
GARY: how about every time?
GARY: but they only show up when you look for them. looking for them changes things.
SARAH: some of these are prices. there's going to be a lot of nines when...
GARY: there is something wrong with the world.
SARAH: you have an eyelash on your... here...

SARAH: i can get you out of here. but you have to trust me. 
MARGARET [O.S.]: morning.

MARGARET: everything okay? 
GARY: peachy.
MARGARET: peachy's good. i like peaches.

MARGARET: you want coffee? 
GARY: sure.
GARY: what do i do?
SARAH: you have to trust me.

MARGARET: you okay? 
GARY: no.
MARGARET: oh.
GARY: tell me about the nines.
MARGARET: the nines?
GARY: the nines.
MARGARET: sort of hard to start there...
GARY: try. and don't tell me i'm imagining it. they're showing up everywhere, and i want to know why.
MARGARET: best guess? they're your subconscious trying to remind you who you are.
GARY: i'm a nine?
MARGARET: yes. it doesn't make a lot of sense of out context. coffee?
GARY: why don't you drink coffee? you're always drinking tea.

MARGARET: happy? 
MARGARET: you're not going to understand this yet, but we've known each other for like 25 years. one day when i was 12, you called me out of the blue.
GARY: talking.
MARGARET: on the phone. usually.
GARY: i never met you before i came here.
MARGARET: you, gary, never met me. but you're not always... i can understand why you're a little confused.
GARY: no. i'm a lot confused.
MARGARET: theories?
GARY: this is all a dream.
MARGARET: no.
GARY: i'm in a coma.
MARGARET: no.
GARY: then i'm dead. this is hell, or purgatorium or something.
MARGARET: okay, a purgatorium is where romans vomited. but no. this is as real as anything can be.

GARY: what does that mean? 
MARGARET: everything is what it is. but you're not who you think you are.

NEW ANGLE: gary gets up, headed for the front door. 
MARGARET: no! please, gary, don't.

MARGARET: you don't know what you're doing. 
GARY: what happens if i cross this line?
MARGARET: i don't know. but it's not good.

GAVIN: melissa mccarthy is my first and only choice for the lead. 
MELISSA: i love it. i'll do it.

45.: susan howard vp, drama development 
SUSAN: i just don't know if you need the cold open. people want to get right to the story.

GAVIN: i invited susan to see a rough cut because i trust her taste. 
SUSAN: could we be more clear why mary is so freaked out at that moment?
GAVIN: wow. i thought it was pretty obvious. and dramatic.
GAVIN [INTERVIEW]: more importantly, i trust her as a barometer of roger's taste.
SUSAN: i know. but that's roger's big thing this season. never let the audience be confused.

MELISSA: what's the line? 
GAVIN: how could you...
MELISSA: howkajew?
GAVIN: yeah.
MELISSA: howkajew. it sounds like kosher drug paraphernalia. like, come on shmuley! have a toke on the howkajew.
GAVIN: i know. it's just for the test screening.
MELISSA: they really think people won't get it?
GAVIN: the people might not.
MELISSA: i didn't think we were making the show for people.
MELISSA: howkajew... how could you... how couldjew...

MELISSA: i feel so dirty. 
GAVIN: that's how i like ya.

GAVIN: that guy's looking at me. 
SUSAN: he can't see you.
MODERATOR: how about you? did you feel it was...
AGITATED MAN: it's not real.
MODERATOR: and what do you mean by that?

GAVIN: the guy was crazy. obviously. the show is kinda twisted, and it just flipped something in him. 
PRODUCER'S VOICE: what did he say?
GAVIN: oblivio accebit. it's latin.
PRODUCER'S VOICE: what do you think it means?
GAVIN: other than the world is coming to an end? "oblivio" also means forgetting, forgetfulness. i think that's what i'm going to do. forget it.

SUSAN: did you have a chance to look at the cards yet? 
GAVIN: from the screening?
MELISSA: pardon me. daddy needs his drink.
SAM: woman, where's my cocktail!
MELISSA: i'm a-comin! i still love you most.
SUSAN: people write stuff on the cards they won't say in a focus group. they get more specific.
SUSAN: roger has this advice i always remember.

SUSAN: forget about anyone who scores you in the twos and threes. they'll never like your show. 
SUSAN: instead, look for the nines.
GAVIN: the nines.
SUSAN: they're the one who think your show is almost the best thing they've ever seen. they get your vision. they just want it to be even better.
MELISSA: round two is starting without you!
SUSAN: so you'll look at the cards?
GAVIN: absolutely.

GAVIN: she doesn't have a ton to do in the pilot. there's so much to set up, you don't get a lot of melissa- time. 
SUSAN: true. that's one of the challenges with a premise pilot.
GAVIN: but the network still likes the show?
SUSAN: of course. roger is your biggest cheerleader.
GAVIN: how about above roger?
SUSAN: roger calls the shots.
GAVIN: after he consults with the higher powers.
SUSAN: true.
GAVIN: do they like the show?
SUSAN: they haven't seen it. they're watching all the pilots on friday.
GAVIN: why are you focusing on melissa?

SUSAN: because she's the biggest concern. 
GAVIN: she's also the biggest star in the show.
SUSAN: no, you're the biggest star. roger made a huge deal with you, and he went along with casting melissa when that wasn't his instinct.
GAVIN: well, hooray for roger. i don't understand what you want me to do.
SUSAN: meet with someone.
GAVIN: who?
SUSAN: dahlia salem.
SUSAN: the network has a holding deal with her.
GAVIN: yes. and you put her in gatin's pilot.
SUSAN: it's dead. it's dying. but the network loves dahlia. so if she could jump over to your show...
GAVIN: replace melissa and reshoot the pilot.
SUSAN: roger would pay for it.
GAVIN: so is this even about melissa?

SUSAN: roger's on a flight to london. but i talked with him before he left. 
GAVIN: what does that mean?
SUSAN: it means yes.
GAVIN: yes, replace melissa?
SUSAN: he wants your show on the air, starring dahlia. i just got off the phone with her agents. they love it. she loves you.
GAVIN: what about melissa?
SUSAN: you want me to call her agents?
GAVIN: no. i'll tell her.

MELISSA: as long as he needs me, i know where i must be... 
MELISSA: in-between the pilot and the series, i'm trying to squeeze in a one-woman show. i've always been obsessed with nuns. they're sort of like fag-hags.

GAVIN: i think my house is haunted. 
MELISSA: your house is really old.
GAVIN: 1926. ever since i got back, i feel like there's someone else there. and then last night, i thought i heard something. a woman singing.
MELISSA: like a ghost?

GAVIN: i guess. and then i saw something. 
MELISSA: the woman?
GAVIN: it was a man. i think it was me.
MELISSA: your house is haunted by yourself?
GAVIN: yeah.
MELISSA: gavin, are you alright?
GAVIN: no. no.
GAVIN: the network wants to replace you.
MELISSA: oh my
GAVIN: and i'm letting them, because i really want the show on the air. i have all these characters inside my head, and they want to live. i'm the only way they can. this is the only way they can. i have five seasons mapped out, and though it either you go away, or the show goes. i had to make a decision, and that's the decision i made. i'm sorry.
MELISSA: so it's done. finished. decided.
GAVIN: yes.

MELISSA: i understand. it's not your fault. you're morally incapable of doing the right thing. 
MELISSA: don't get me wrong. i think you do feel bad for me. but that's all you feel for me. you still see me as the fat girl you call on friday night when a date falls through. let's go to a movie! let's go to fubar! and if you meet a hot piece of ass, don't worry about melissa, you can apologize tomorrow. or don't! same difference. it's not like we're actually friends.
GAVIN: i don't want to do this on camera.
MELISSA: no, because you can't control it. your little puppets are off their strings, running around. saying things you didn't write. reality terrifies you.
GAVIN: reality.
MELISSA: yes.
GAVIN: the reality is, you would not be here without me. i gave you your first few roles. and your career is a result of that.
MELISSA: thank you. thank you for finally playing that card. i always knew you were holding onto it, the "i invented melissa mccarthy card." congratulations, you win. the game is over.

GAVIN: it's surreal being here. none of this is how i planned it. 
GAVIN: hey you!
WOMAN'S VOICE: hi. gavin.
DAHLIA: you're doing your...show.
GAVIN: get on. come join reality television.
GAVIN: when did you get in?

DAHLIA: just now. this whole last 24 hours has been surreal. 
GAVIN: i just said surreal.
DAHLIA: you're good? i wanted to call you.
GAVIN: please. call anytime. i don't sleep.
DAHLIA: i just felt weird about what happened.
GAVIN: did something happen?

GAVIN: so i just bumped into dahlia salem, star of my show... 
GAVIN: ... who tells me gatin's show got picked up, so no, she won't be in my show, which makes me wonder, does my show even exist?
GAVIN: no, i've left word with roger. i've left word with susan. it's like they've dropped off the face of the earth.

GATINS: look, i'm sorry. but i'm kind of not. i want my show on the air. and i think it was for you to go after dahlia behind my back. 
GAVIN: i heard your show was gone.
GATINS: i "heard" you fired melissa mccarthy without having a backup. why would they pick up your show when you don't have a star?
GAVIN: the network wanted dahlia.
GATINS: yeah, in my show. we tested right before you. our numbers were through the roof.
GAVIN: really.

GATINS: really. who's your exec? 
GAVIN: susan howard.
GATINS: she would know. she was there.

GAVIN: i will break your finger. 
SUSAN: i'll call you back.
SUSAN: roger wanted to talk to you personally.
GAVIN: 
SUSAN: they're only picking up two dramas.
GAVIN: the rest is, what, reality?
SUSAN: you can go mid-season.

GAVIN: you can go to hell. 
SUSAN: wow.
SUSAN: you think i deliberately sabotaged your show.
GAVIN: didn't you?
SUSAN: g., i'm on your side. trust me, i'm the only one who is trying to protect you.

GAVIN: all i want to know is why. 
SUSAN: you want a motive?
GAVIN: yes.
SUSAN: this isn't "crime lab." no one got murdered.
GAVIN: my show did. so tell me why.
SUSAN: i had to get you away from her.
GAVIN: melissa.
SUSAN: you had to give her up. c'mon, g. if she really mattered, you couldn't have betrayed her so easily.
GAVIN: i didn't.

SUSAN: what, you're the victim? the big creator can't stand up to one little d-girl? it was your choice. i didn't make you do anything. i mean, do you have any principles? do you believe in anything but your own ego? 
GAVIN: you.
SUSAN: your dialogue used to be sharper. maybe gatins could do a polish.
SUSAN: is that all there is?
SUSAN: do you feel like a man? because i'll tell you a secret.
SUSAN: you're not.

GAVIN: done. gone. i`m not going to be your puppet. 
OFF-SCREEN VOICE: are you alright?
GAVIN: i'm fine.
OCTAVIA: who were you talking to?

MARGARET: i can understand why you're a little confused. 
GARY: no. i'm a lot confused.
MARGARET: theories?
GARY: this is all a dream.
MARGARET: no.
GARY: i'm in a coma.
MARGARET: no.
GARY: then i'm dead. this is hell, or purgatorium or something.

MARGARET: okay, a purgatorium is where romans vomited. but no. this is as real as anything can be. 
GARY: what does that mean?
MARGARET: everything is what it is. but you're not who you think you are.
GARY: okay, then. who am i?
MARGARET: you're a multi-dimensional being of vast, almost infinite power. you created this world on a whim, and decided to stick around to see how it turned out. you, this body you're in, is just one of your incarnations. avatars. call you what you will.
GARY: are you saying i'm god?
MARGARET: technically, no. if is a ten -- a theoretical ultimate, that-which- no-greater-can-be-imagined -- you're more of a nine.
GARY: so what are you?
MARGARET: humans are sevens. monkeys are sixes.
GARY: what are the eights?
MARGARET: koalas. they're telepathic. plus, they control the weather.

MARGARET: what's important is that you, you're the big cheese. el supremo. you could destroy the world with a single thought. don't, incidentally. just file that away. but the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. when people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. they just don't want to be forgotten. 
MARGARET: so you understand, i would have told you earlier, but i didn't...
GARY: yeah.
MARGARET: okay.
GARY: i understand. but i don't believe you.

GABRIEL: noelle! don't get too far ahead. 
MARY: no. you had ice cream at lunch.
GABRIEL: apparently frozen yogurt doesn't count.
MARY: i'll make note.

MARY: did you hit it? 
GABRIEL: shouldn't have to.

GABRIEL: i think we left the overhead light on. 
MARY: 
MARY: noelle.
GABRIEL: battery is dead. least the starter is.
MARY: how do we...?
GABRIEL: we call the service. that's all we can do.
MARY: it's just the little battery that's dead, right? the big one is probably fine.
GABRIEL: i guess.
MARY: we can't jump it from one battery to the other? cross-over somehow?
GABRIEL: who did you marry? macgyver?

MARY: are you getting a signal? 
GABRIEL: no. do you?
MARY: yes! one bar.
MARY: we're okay. daddy's calling people to help us.
GABRIEL: the minute you try to place a call, the bar goes away.
MARY: keep trying.
GABRIEL: okay, i'll keep trying, mary. but it will keep happening.
MARY: well, what do you want to do?
GABRIEL: i don't know.
MARY: maybe if you hold it up higher.

GABRIEL: the problem is we're boxed in. it's a canyon. 
GABRIEL: where we turned off the main road, it was more open. and higher, too.
MARY: that's at least a mile.
GABRIEL: i can run that.
MARY: so...we stay here?
GABRIEL: you okay with that?
MARY: i don't think we have a choice, so, yeah. go.
GABRIEL: daddy's going to get a truck to help us out. you take care of your mom, okay?
GABRIEL: i'll be right back.

GABRIEL: excuse me! hi! hello? she stops, turns. 
GABRIEL: excuse me. do you have a cell phone?
SIERRA: no, i don't. there's no service up here.
GABRIEL: yeah, i'm finding that out.
SIERRA: you can usually get a signal up at the ranger station.
GABRIEL: okay...

SIERRA: you follow the road. it's probably... i don't know. you have a car? 
GABRIEL: it's dead. that's why i need...
SIERRA: oh...
GABRIEL: yeah.
GABRIEL: are you headed back to your car now? if you could give me a ride to a gas station, wherever...
GABRIEL: oh. hey. look, i'm not some crazy ted bundy guy. i'm not going to you or kill you or anything.
GABRIEL: of course, that's what ted bundy would say. look, i'm a videogame designer. my wife is an editor. my daughter is four.
GABRIEL: they're waiting back at the car, and i want to get some help before it gets dark.
SIERRA: i can call somebody when i get to town.

GABRIEL: i believe you. i do. but you don't know where the car is. and the guy might not come. we can't be up here all night. 
SIERRA: i'm sorry.
GABRIEL: don't be sorry. just help me out here.
SIERRA: no. i can't. i'm sorry.
GABRIEL: why won't you trust me? she doesn't turn back, heading down the road.

MARY: okay, but you have to be careful, understand? you have to use big girl hands. 
MARY: do you want to see where we were today? noelle nods.

MARY: okay, now hit play. this button. 
MARY: there's you. and there's daddy. you're a little movie star, huh?
MARY: he'll be back soon. don't you worry.

SIERRA: hey! 
GABRIEL: were you following me?
SIERRA: once i was sure you weren't following me. i'm sorry, it's just...
GABRIEL: you thought i was ted bundy.
SIERRA: kinda.
GABRIEL: my name's gabriel. bundy.
SIERRA: sierra.
SIERRA: weird that there's no cars. at all.

GABRIEL: yeah. 
SIERRA: so, listen. i'm parked that way.
SIERRA: it's not that far. if you want, i'll give you a ride to town.
GABRIEL: really?
SIERRA: yeah. make up some karma.
GABRIEL: lead the way.

SIERRA: okay, confession. i kind of recognized you. 
GABRIEL: really?
SIERRA: i wasn't sure, but i think i saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had. you're, like, the
GABRIEL: no.
SIERRA: you're like the quentin tarantino of that world. a videogame
GABRIEL: not really.

SIERRA: fine. 
GABRIEL: you seriously recognized me off of one photo?
SIERRA: i thought you were kinda hot.
GABRIEL: considering..?
SIERRA: within the subset of videogame people.
GABRIEL: okay.
SIERRA: i wasn't masturbating to your picture or anything.
GABRIEL: well, i guess i'm flattered.
SIERRA: you should be. i'm stingy with compliments.
GABRIEL: so your boyfriend plays videogames?
SIERRA: ex-boyfriend. and yes. way too many. he used to play evercrack back in the day, but yours, well, that was like...what's worse than crack?
GABRIEL: super-crack?
SIERRA: sure. he was this orc witch doctor guy.
GABRIEL: shaman?
SIERRA: yeah. at one point he was spending like, 40 hours a week gathering "thunderleaf" or whatever.

SIERRA: then i was his mule, hauling it around because he ran out of space. 
GABRIEL: you had an account?
SIERRA: i was part of your world, and you didn't even know it.
GABRIEL: sorry.
SIERRA: you can make it up to me.

MAN'S VOICE: ...i have five seasons mapped out, and though it either you go away, or the show goes. i had to make a decision, and that's the decision i made. i'm sorry. 
MELISSA: so it's done. finished. decided.
GAVIN: yeah.
MELISSA: i understand.

GAVIN: you do? 
MELISSA: i understand. it's not your fault. you're morally incapable of doing the right thing.

SIERRA: so you play a lot of characters at once? 
GABRIEL: a couple. most people do.
SIERRA: you're not most people. you created the world. you know all the secret codes.
GABRIEL: what, like `god mode'?
SIERRA: that's what you call it?
GABRIEL: that's when you have all the powers, and you can't be killed. it's fine when you're designing, but it's really boring to play. a game isn't fun unless there are rules.
SIERRA: and you make the rules.
GABRIEL: yes i do. i mean, you want to give everyone freedom, but they can't handle it. half your players are teenage boys, and it's like they're programmed to be destructive.

SIERRA: do you think i'm pretty? 
GABRIEL: what?
SIERRA: do you think i'm hot? on a purely physical level.
GABRIEL: sure.
SIERRA: that's a rave.
GABRIEL: well, i don't know why you're asking.
SIERRA: my ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says, "what i like about you is that you're not so hot that i'm afraid of losing you."
GABRIEL: so where's the orc now?
SIERRA: he's dead. i spiked his water bottle with a massive quantity of ghb. he hallucinated, went into convulsions and died.
GABRIEL: remind me not to you off, sarah.

SIERRA: sierra. 
GABRIEL: sorry.
SIERRA: and what makes you think you haven't me off already?

MARY: how are you doing, kiddo? 
MARY: i was thinking we could all go to el cholo for dinner. how would you feel about some blue corn enchiladas? should we ask daddy when he gets back?
NOELLE: he's not coming back.
MARY: how could you...
MELISSA: howkajew. how could you. how could you.

MELISSA: i feel so dirty. 
GAVIN: that's how i like ya.

IX: he's sweating a lot. 
GABRIEL: am i crazy, or is it getting hotter?
SIERRA: oh, you're crazy.
GABRIEL: i have a wife. and a daughter.
SIERRA: where are they?

GABRIEL: back at the car. 
SIERRA: i mean, which direction?
GABRIEL: they're back...
SIERRA: face it, g.: you don't know where they are. you don't know where you are. we've been walking in circles for an hour.
GABRIEL: where's your car?
SIERRA: there is no car. that was all a... "pretense," i guess. an excuse to get you alone.
SIERRA: dizzy, huh? it's probably just the ghb. in the water.

GABRIEL: what's happening? 
SIERRA: i'm sorry it had to come this, g.

GABRIEL: you're trying to kill me. 
SIERRA: no! no. this isn't a murder.

FLASHBACK SEQUENCE.: images to accompany previous dialogue... 
SUSAN: i had to get you away from her. she was holding you back. you had to give her up.
GAVIN: melissa?
SARAH: i can you out of here. but you have to trust me.
SUSAN: do you feel like a man? you're not.

SIERRA: that's right. just let it go. let it go. 
GABRIEL: why are you doing this?
SIERRA: you did it to yourself. admitting that is the first step.

86.: they're nines as well. 
SIERRA: you're a crack-head, g. the thing is, this planet, these people, they're your drug of choice.

S.: it's not that hard to make a universe. at first, you just checked in every once in a while. see how the neanderthals were doing. move some continents around. but then you got more into it. starting playing a couple of characters of your own. kings. slaves. messiahs. pretty soon, you were playing 24/7. 
G.: how long have i..?
S.: you've been gone for four thousand years. not that time means the same for us, but...
G.: you came looking for me.
S.: that's what a girl does.
G.: why now?
OCTAVIA: because you forgot who you were.

87.: x228 x228 
AGITATED MAN: you forgot this wasn't real.

S.: we couldn't just storm in on a fiery chariot. it's your universe. we had to play by your rules. we had to make you see how limited and corrupt your little world was. don't get me wrong, this world is nice. it's cozy. but do you remember where you came from? 
G.: it was warm. and white. like...

GABRIEL: maybe if i just cut back, didn't get so involved... 
SIERRA: we both know that'll never work. next week, you'll be back here redesigning the pinecones. you have to quit cold-turkey.
GABRIEL: i can't.

MARY: noelle! noelle! 
GABRIEL: she's here.
GABRIEL: i didn't forget you guys.
MARY: everything okay?
GABRIEL: absolutely. let's go home.

MARY: you need to go, don't you? 
GABRIEL: no. i can stay.
MARY: how long? forever? every day, you'd know what you were missing.
MARY: what happens? if you go.
GABRIEL: worst-case scenario? spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void. oblivio accebit. the end of everything.
MARY: that's all?
GABRIEL: that probably wouldn't happen. the basic structure of the universe should hold. i guess i'm just worried about the human factor.

MARY: in fairness, that's usually in your name. plus we've gotten much more efficient at it. 
GABRIEL: i like this world. i like my life, here, with you and noelle...
MARY: but it's not real. i'm not really your wife, you're not really my husband. on some level, it's all pretend.
GABRIEL: it's not pretend. there's a reason you were there, in every version. you were my sister, my wife, my best friend...
MARY: that's a little creepy.
GABRIEL: i wanted you close. in one version, i even told you. i warned you that some day they might come for me, and...
MARY: ...you'd have to leave. how many versions were there?
GABRIEL: ninety. this is the last one.
MARY: wow.
GABRIEL: i've destroyed billions of people with a thought. obliterated them. and you'd like to think it's painless...
MARY: stop. you don't have to explain, or apologize. everything that is, is because of you. if that's all, that's enough.

MARY: so. 
GABRIEL: so.
MARY: guess you don't really need to pack anything.
GABRIEL: i'm good.
MARY: you're great. it's been a pleasure.
GABRIEL: likewise. i love you.
MARY: love you, too. ya big lug.
GABRIEL: you're my favorite. she smiles.

MAN'S VOICE: honey, do we have nutmeg? 
M: we should.
BEN: cinnamon, too.

NOELLE: if i had a horse... 
NOELLE: i would name her cinnamon.
BEN: really.
NOELLE: and if i had another horse...
BEN: nutmeg?
NOELLE: no, flash.
M: sweetie?
M: this is going to sound really strange, but...what's my name?
NOELLE: mmmmmmmmmm-mommy.
M: right. exactly.
NOELLE: he's not coming back. but it's gonna be okay. he put the pieces together, it's like...
M: the best of all possible worlds.

BEN: honey? is it supposed to stick like this? 
M: we should help him.

S.: it's not that hard to make a universe. at first, you just checked in every once in a while. see how the neanderthals were doing. move some continents around. but then you got more into it. starting playing a couple of characters of your own. kings. slaves. messiahs. pretty soon, you were playing 24/7.

G.: it was warm. and white. like... 
S.: you can't describe it with human words. you can't think it with human thoughts. that's why you have to come back.
