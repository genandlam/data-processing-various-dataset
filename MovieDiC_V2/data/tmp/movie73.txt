BOYS: look! right there! it's shining! 
JACQUES: a coin.
FIRST BOY: i found it.
SECOND BOY: liar!
JACQUES: ok. i'll get it, but no fighting, all right?
JACQUES: we'll split it.
FIRST BOY: you can't split a coin. that's stupid.
SECOND BOY: he's right. you're stupid.
JACQUES: then we'll buy something and split that.
SECOND BOY: a helicopter...
JACQUES: it's a small coin.
FIRST BOY: a ferrari.
SECOND BOY: i don't want a ferrari... what is it?
JACQUES: maybe a little radio.
JACQUES: well. we'll decide later. the light is going.
SECOND BOY: i get the radio from after school, until midnight.
FIRST BOY: since when do you stay up until midnight?
JACQUES: all right, all right... can i concentrate? and you can stop pointing. i've seen it.
VOICE: i've seen it too.
FIRST BOY: it's the italian!
ENZO: well, if it isn't the little frenchman! how is the little frenchman?
JACQUES: fine!
ENZO: you don't mind if i go instead, do you?
JACQUES: no...
ENZO: if you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
ENZO: roberto, mio palmo!
ENZO: count!

ENZO: who's is it now? you saw it but i dove for it! jacques doesn't answer. 
ENZO: roberto? how long?
ROBERTO: six seconds.
ENZO: i'll throw it back into the water. you dive and if you do less than six, it's yours.
ENZO: brava!
BOY: enzo? i saw the coin first... we split?
PRIEST: jacques... come, look.
PRIEST: is it a coin shining down there?
JACQUES: it is. it's a coin! i'll get it for you, father!
PRIEST: it'll be for the poor.
JACQUES: padre?

FATHER: ... come on, time to get up, jacques! 
FATHER: louis, wake up!

FATHER: jacques, come help me. 
JACQUES: you shouldn't dive everyday, papa.
UNCLE LOUIS: then you shouldn't eat everyday, jacques.
UNCLE LOUIS: hey! have you ever seen a mermaid?
JACQUES: no.
UNCLE LOUIS: i've seen them.
UNCLE LOUIS: don't you want to know where?

UNCLE LOUIS: why don't you ask me? 
JACQUES: what?
UNCLE LOUIS: where i saw the mermaids?! why don't you ever ask any question? i'm always the one asking the question! we're sitting here like two stones and i'm taking to myself. ask me something, goddamnit!
JACQUES: why did my mother leave?
UNCLE LOUIS: come on now, pump!

UNCLE LOUIS: your mother didn't leave. she went back to america, that's all. it's her home. she's allergic to this island. she likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor... so one day she left. woman are like that, unpredictable, like the sea. 
JACQUES: so where did you see mermaids?
UNCLE LOUIS: in the bars in athens!
ENZO: jacques! jacques!

SUPERVISOR: signore molinari? 
ROBERTO: yes.
ENZO: how did it happen?
SUPERVISOR: the company asked me to extract everything i could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, i up! can you help?
ENZO: how many are, down there?
SUPERVISOR: just one... we're feeding him air, but he's not breathing regularly... you've got to get him out fast.
ENZO: ten thousand.
SUPERVISOR: lira?
ENZO: dollars.
SUPERVISOR: you're going to hold me up at a time like this?
ROBERTO: you do understand you're talking to the champion diver of the world?
SUPERVISOR: yes, but ten thousand dollars...
ENZO: okay. you tell me. how much would you say the man's life is worth?
ENZO: in my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
SUPERVISOR: what does that mean?
ROBERTO: that you should get your checkbook.

ENZO: dollars, roberto! we took him for ten thousand dollars! 
ROBERTO: enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
ENZO: have the car painted.
ROBERTO: santini will do that for 25 dollars!
ENZO: then tell him to wax it too.
ROBERTO: enzo, really. what are you going to get?
ENZO: a rosary for mama, a dress for angelica, something with rhine- stones for what's her name, and get yourself a suit that fits... but most important...
ROBERTO: yes?
ENZO: find the frenchman. find me mayol.

JOHANA: is this the lago del demonio? ... huacracocha? the old man goes into a long, rambling explanation. 
JOHANA: gracias.
OLD MAN: you welcome.

JOHANA: don't you have a heater? 
FRANK: yeah... sure... is this your first trip to peru?
JOHANA: does anybody live to make a second?
JOHANA: forget about the heater!

FRANK: a drink to warm up? 
JOHANA: yes, thank you. intravenous if possible.
FRANK: tea... or whiskey?
JOHANA: ... both. did i just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
FRANK: ... right. dr. lawrence? the insurance man...
LAWRENCE: it's about time!
JOHANA: would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
FRANK: who?
JOHANA: the guy in the halloween suit!
LAWRENCE: did you have a nice trip? we were getting restless, it's been three weeks since the accident.

LAWRENCE: you should get things moving, you know. we're out of equipment and we can't do half of our experiments...! frank, check the program! 
JOHANA: who... who is that?
LAWRENCE: mayol... jacques mayol.
JOHANA: that's the experiment? dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
LAWRENCE: ... the truck fell into a very deep crevasse. we weren't able to save the equipment.
JOHANA: i'll have to talk to the driver.
LAWRENCE: in the spring when he melts!
JOHANA: you really send him under the ice? he isn't a slave or a convict or anything?
LAWRENCE: my dear, science is a cruel mistress.
JOHANA: but... how is he going to breathe?
LAWRENCE: he isn't going to breathe.
LAWRENCE: listen...
LAWRENCE: that's his heartbeat.

LAWRENCE: he's in the fluoroscope now. listen to his heart. impressive, huh? the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. it's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now. 
JOHANA: how long can he stay down? without breathing?
LAWRENCE: it depends. he should come up soon. unless he's decided to stay for the night.
JOHANA: why is he doing this?
LAWRENCE: for one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, i wish i knew.
JOHANA: shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
LAWRENCE: coffee might be nice.
JOHANA: will he understand spanish?
LAWRENCE: his mother's an american. he spent half of his life in the states. i'd try english if i were you.

JACQUES: i recognize you. 
JOHANA: we saw each other a little while ago.
JACQUES: in the lake?
JOHANA: no... in the hut.

DRIVER: it's beautiful, isn't it? 
DRIVER: we had some bad wind this week. the "mistral"!! "peuchere"! there isn't one olive left on its tree. it suddenly left us this morning... i sure won't be the one to call it back.

JACQUES: good morning, everybody! did you sleep well? i slept in a plane, and it wasn't too great. 
JACQUES: hey! presents.
JACQUES: you think i'd forget you?
JACQUES: for bathsheba.

JACQUES: it's a llama. you understand? from peru. it's fighting. 
JACQUES: that's for you, darjeeling. we wouldn't want you to catch cold!
JACQUES: and now... "ta, da..." for you tina.
JACQUES: something you've never seen either.
JACQUES: snow!
JACQUES: a new experience, tina. i missed you little rascals. did you get my post card?
JACQUES: oh? is that what you want? alright, but five minutes, no more. i have a taxi waiting.

SALLY: i changed the lock you son of a 
JOHANA: ... sally?
SALLY: you're back! hello. we were burgled.
JOHANA: again?
SALLY: they got the new t.v.
SALLY: ... and the new stereo.
JOHANA: i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
SALLY: yep. how was your trip...? help me clean up, okay?
JOHANA: you called the police?
SALLY: they're going to send detectives.
JOHANA: so what, all they ever want is your phone number anyway. johana goes over, slumps into an easy chair and sighs. after a beat...
SALLY: well?
JOHANA: what?
SALLY: how was your trip?
JOHANA: nice... very interesting... great! ... i guess.
SALLY: okay... who'd you meet?
SALLY: a cardiogram...? you met a doctor! congratulations, you're in the chips... unless they have socialized medicine in peru. do they?
JOHANA: it's his heartbeat.
SALLY: oh jesus...! i'll make some coffee. they left the stove.

JOHANA: 6'3", 6'1", maybe 5'9" -- you can't be sure, you know the flippers, they add height or they take it away, or something. anyway short dark hair... not punk or anything, just short. and the cutest smile. he wasn't smiling at me, i don't think -- just smiling. and he thought he saw me in the lake. i mean that was a figure of speech... they're so romantic, the french. 
SALLY: i thought you said he was peruvian?
JOHANA: haven't you been listening?
SALLY: ... since eight o'clock last night...! you're in love.
JOHANA: don't be a jerk. there's no such thing as love at first sight.

ENZO: jacques, my friend, how are you? 
JACQUES: enzo...
ENZO: i leave you swimming and twenty years later, you're still in the water! what the are you doing?
JACQUES: yes.
ENZO: that's good. you never would have recognized me, huh? check out the suit! looking good, no? you know i'm the world champion?
JACQUES: yes, i know.
ENZO: i dove 315 feet!
JACQUES: great!
ENZO: they say i'm like lazarus. you know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
ENZO: doesn't it surprise you that i just show up like this... listen, the world championship starts in ten days in taormina. be my guest.
ENZO: your ticket.
JACQUES: why?
ENZO: because i'm sure you're dying to beat me.
JACQUES: i don't want to be in any competition... i dive because i like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
ENZO: no. all you need is to want to be the best.
JACQUES: you're the best, enzo!
ENZO: that's too easy! every time i beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me: "d'you know that french guy, mayol? he's supposed to be very good! too bad he doesn't compete." so, you're going to come with me to taormina! first, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure. ... i'll see you there...

DUFFY: this is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street. 
JOHANA: what kind?
DUFFY: johana, am i boring you?
JOHANA: sorry. of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. what did you say?
DUFFY: i said that the file is incomplete. see if you can get through to this lawrence character and have him send the peruvian registration for his missing truck... and don't let him tell you it was in the glove compartment.
JOHANA: right chief!
DUFFY: did the driver really freeze?
JOHANA: like a popsicle. they're keeping him on a stick until spring.
DUFFY: my i'm glad i didn't go.
JOHANA: ... so am i.

LAWRENCE: okay, okay. you'll have it by the end of the week, how's that? 
JOHANA: you've made me a happy insurance person.
LAWRENCE: then, goodbye.
JOHANA: wait! professor...?
LAWRENCE: ... yes?
JOHANA: you don't know how i could reach that diver of yours... mayol... we need some additional information... i mean, we have a few questions to ask him.

LAWRENCE: the last thing i heard, he was off to taormina for the world diving championships. that's taormina, in sicily! 
JOHANA: listen, i just found out we've got real problems in sicily!
DUFFY: what d'you mean?
JOHANA: the mafia! la cosa nostra! coppola! de niro...! i knew it! i knew we shouldn't have written that policy!!
DUFFY: what's happened??
JOHANA: the documents are forged.
DUFFY: no!
JOHANA: yes! the notary is a phony. he has the same signature as the contractor!
DUFFY: it can't be true!
JOHANA: we have to send somebody over there immediately! if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. we'll be off the hook. there's a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily.
DUFFY: i'll send cardoza, he'll be able to...
JOHANA: i tried him, he can't go. his son is being bar mitzvohed tomorrow...
DUFFY: i thought it was spanish that you spoke?
JOHANA: italian is practically the same thing.

RECEPTIONIST: mayol... mayol... no reservation. 
JACQUES: ... are you sure?
RECEPTIONIST: positive, sir.
JACQUES: this is the hotel san domenico?
RECEPTIONIST: yes sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
JACQUES: yes, but... so, you haven't got a room left?
RECEPTIONIST: no sir, the hotel is full because of the diving championship.
JACQUES: ah?!

ENZO: be careful with that car, it's a new paint job. 
ENZO: giacomino! my friend! my brother!
ENZO: so you finally decided to join us?
ENZO: hey paolo! come stai? get my key! you remember my little brother roberto?
JACQUES: i remember. hi roberto!
ENZO: what room have you got?
JACQUES: i don't have one.
ENZO: you don't have a room? paolo? what did i just hear? i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
JACQUES: it's okay, enzo. i'll go somewhere else.
ENZO: not only is jacques mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! and you're throwing him out! are you crazy, or what? stupido!
JACQUES: enzo drop it, i'll find something.
ENZO: take mine. i'll take the countess' suite. she told me she was leaving for the cemetery... she'll be more comfortable there.
ENZO: i'm glad you're here.

ENZO: "spaghetti del mare" it's delicious here. it's the one thing they really know how to make. 
WAITER: del mare for two?
JACQUES: yes, sure, for two.
ENZO: and a bottle of "frascatti". two bottles!
WAITER: si signore, grazie mille.
ENZO: he moves just like a woman. it must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh? to breathe in one, swim in the other...

ENZO: ... so, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. 
ENZO: well, what are they?
JACQUES: i'm sorry... i don't know how to ask the questions.
ENZO: well, then. i'll do the asking for you. "tell me dear enzo, how did you become world champion?" oh, that's a long story. well, after you left amorgos, i went back to italy and joined the navy. so you now have in front of you -- captain molinari, who's been on leave of absence for the past 14 years...
JACQUES: that's good.
ENZO: how do you make a living? your experiments, does it pay well?
JACQUES: it's okay.
ENZO: ... you married?
JACQUES: no.
ENZO: me neither, 'cause of my mother. she's a curse, my mamma, a tornado. stubborn as a mule! i was engaged... for a week. after that, mamma was so mad, i tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
ENZO: so, not married. well, good for you. you play the field, like me.
JACQUES: exactly, i mean, after all, we're men!
ENZO: right! that's what i tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
JACQUES: people say that?
ENZO: forget it. i was joking.

ENZO: eh! la madonna! this one is for me. i'll bet you my watch that she's in my bed tonight. 
ENZO: i tell you she's mine!
JOHANA: hello!
ENZO: you know each other?
JOHANA: yes.
ENZO: enzo molinari.
ENZO: this is a great pleasure.
JOHANA: johana cross, pleased to meet you. well! isn't this a coincidence. i really wasn't expecting this... all the way out here. it's incredible!
JACQUES: please, have a seat.
JOHANA: thank you. i wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
JACQUES: no, no!
ENZO: not at all!
JACQUES: you're staying at the hotel?
JOHANA: i wish, but it's full. they recommended a pension in town. they say that all of taormina is full.
ENZO: it's the free diving world championship. i am by the way world champion!
JACQUES: but what brought you to sicily?
JOHANA: i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo. i work for an insurance company. so, i decided to take a few days off. i don't know this island at all. it really is gorgeous.
ENZO: there is no place in the world more beautiful than sicily!
ENZO: a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
JOHANA: i think i'll have a coffee.
JACQUES: no, no. you'll like it. it's superb.
JOHANA: ... okay. i'll try. enzo pours the wine.
ENZO: where did you two meet?
JOHANA: in a lake.
ENZO: i might have known. as i was telling you earlier, i'm the world champion free diver.
JOHANA: congratulations.
ENZO: some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. one has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
JACQUES: enzo?
ENZO: what?
JACQUES: your mother?
ENZO: ahi, ahi, cazzo! ma mamia! where...? she'll kill me... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.

ENZO: ... mamma! 
MAMMA MOLINARI: you expect me to carry all the luggage myself?
ENZO: mamma. roberto and an elevator... isn't that enough?
MAMMA MOLINARI: what have you been eating?
ENZO: coffee only, i'm diving tomorrow. you remember little jacques, jacques mayol...
JACQUES: madame...
ENZO: ... and his friend, johana...
WAITER: spaghetti del mare! dead silence.
JOHANA: thank you.
MAMMA MOLINARI: americana?
MAMMA MOLINARI: benvenuto!

JOHANA: thanks for helping with the bag. it looks great! 
JACQUES: i thought it was a nice place. isn't it?
JOHANA: i'm being a pain in the ass. it's beautiful here.
JOHANA: you're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
JACQUES: i don't know... why?
JOHANA: just because... i would have liked to visit the town... see the coast... i don't know anybody... expect for you. but you are going to be very busy. you must have tons of things to prepare, interviews... and a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration, right?
JACQUES: yes... maybe... i don't know. i don't like competitions... it ruins the fun. don't you think?
JOHANA: i guess... but you know... i'm american and i've mostly been taught to be competitive... there's always pleasure of being the best?
JACQUES: maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... you see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. it's a feeling... i don't know how to say this... voluptuous?
ENZO: c'mon, you two... jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. we have a new world champion.
JACQUES: i'm a little tired, i don't know if...
ENZO: get in the car!

ENZO: roberto! the bow-tie! 
ENZO: very good.
ROBERTO: what about the shoes?
ENZO: very chic. anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
JACQUES: no.
ENZO: then, it's very chic. avanti!

JOHANA: i thought you'd be at the dinner. 
JACQUES: it's too loud for me.
JOHANA: you look adorable.
JACQUES: thank you...

NOVELLI: ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please. mr. andre bonnet, president of the international diving championship committee, is going to present this trophy to the new world champion of free diving. this afternoon, our new champion descended to the remarkable depth of 280 feet. 
NOVELLI: this young man tia...
NOVELLI: tiraro... tirao-re... moa...
TAHITIAN: tiraero moameora.
NOVELLI: ... let's all give him a big hand.
ENZO: a one day hero!

ENZO: a new world record! that's great! it gives me something to beat tomorrow! you ever been to tahiti? 
JOHANA: no.
ENZO: i'll take you there. we'll live in the sun. you'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
JOHANA: you forgot the hula!
ENZO: yes, of course, i'll do the hula!
JOHANA: you'll be lovely, but no thanks. jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
JACQUES: i don't know how... excuse me.
ENZO: he looks strange, doesn't he? like a baby that just learned to walk.
JOHANA: have you known him long?
ENZO: forever. we used to live on the same island in greece, when we were kids.
JOHANA: what was he like, when he was little?
ENZO: little. very little. and skinny, very skinny too. that is compared to me.
JOHANA: i get it, enzo you were a superior child.
ENZO: exactly! what is it johana? you're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
ENZO: forget it, don't think of jacques as a human being. he's from another world.
JOHANA: and just where are you from?
ENZO: italy!

ENZO: there is nothing like music. it speaks from the heart. can you tell me why we bother diving in the dark, the cold, without ever taking the time to breathe? huh? can you tell me why we do it? 
ENZO: why?
JACQUES: ... for the mermaids.
ENZO: my father used to see them everywhere too... but the only one he ever caught was my mother... actually she caught him.
JACQUES: today at lunch, you asked me if i had any questions.
ENZO: ah ha. you finally want to know about women.
JACQUES: why? are they what's most important?
ENZO: no... it depends... sometimes they are... what, exactly do you want to know?
JACQUES: ... everything.
ENZO: everything about what?
JACQUES: well... about everything.

ENZO: ... so, between mamma, roberto and the sisters, we yell and scream all day long. except with angelica. she just cries. and then finally, we all end up kissing. can you explain that to me? 
ENZO: because that's what love is all about. it's a pain in the but keeps us together. a large and beautiful family!
JACQUES: enzo... we must quit the competition.
ENZO: why?
JACQUES: if we don't... i'm going to beat you.
ENZO: huh? well listen to him! do you hear that?
JOHANA: no.
ENZO: he looks me in the eye like some gold fish, and says: "i'm going to beat you".
JOHANA: ... that's what he's here for, isn't he?
ENZO: listen to her! "that's what he's here for"! he's here to loose, that's what he's here for. first of all, i'm unbeatable. second, how old are you?
JACQUES: two years younger than you.
ENZO: as i said, second of all you're too skinny. you've got tiny lungs. i still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
JACQUES: the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
ENZO: look at me. these aren't lungs. these are... tanks. how long can you hold your breath?
JACQUES: i don't know. longer than you.
ENZO: we'll see.

JOHANA: take it easy... 
PARAMEDIC: don't worry, he's empty now. he needs sleep, that's all. the two men leave the room.
JACQUES: who won?
JOHANA: won what? the hole award? well, let me tell you, it's a tie!
JOHANA: acting like a pair of two year olds! you could have died in that pool!
JACQUES: please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
JOHANA: lucky i was there to save you.
JACQUES: you jumped in?
JOHANA: only to help the medics, i assure you.
JACQUES: my wallet.
JOHANA: it's still here.
JACQUES: no. i want to show you. is it ruined?
JOHANA: well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... not even for pictures of dolphins...
JACQUES: give it to me.
JACQUES: my real family... what kind of man has such a family? she takes the picture out of his hands.
JACQUES: i'm sick of never feeling at home anywhere. johana takes him in her arms. he breaks down.

ROBERTO: enzo, wake up! 
ENZO: eh? si! avanti!
ROBERTO: the medics are looking all over for you.
ENZO: i'm meditating, can't you see? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down. i can take a five minute nap, can't i? the boat stops. the anchor is thrown over board. the sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready for the competition. today is enzo's turn to dive. a man is hooking a plaque indicating the depth onto a lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable.

DOCTOR: mr. molinari, i'm terribly sorry but i cannot allow you to dive in such an advanced state of exhaustion. 
ENZO: what do you know about the sea? huh? nothing! so you just put your tubes and tin cans away. the sea is mine! i know when she is ready for me and when she isn't. and today, she is ready. understand?
DOCTOR: you dive at your own risk. you're been warned.
ENZO: brave.

JOHANA: you scared me! 
JOHANA: just checking up on your family. i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... well...
JACQUES: i'm glad you stayed. thank you.
JOHANA: i'd better get back now.
JACQUES: you... you wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
JACQUES: ... no?
JOHANA: no? huh? yes, of course!!

JACQUES: what's the matter? 
TRAINER: i don't understand. we've tried for two days. they won't eat. they won't perform. it's since we got the new one.

JACQUES: is she the new one? surprised, the trainer nods. 
JOHANA: how can you tell it's a female?
JACQUES: ... the way she moves.

TRAINER: did you ever think of trying the public pool? 
JOHANA: he's a dolphin specialist.
TRAINER: in that case what's wrong with the new one? is she sick or not.
JACQUES: not the way you mean.
TRAINER: what am i supposed to do? do i call the dealer...? the investment, you understand... i certainly am entitled to complain!
JACQUES: it's going to cost you more than you think!
JACQUES: she's not like the others. she can't stand to be away from the sea.
JOHANA: how do you know that?
JACQUES: i don't know, i just feel it.

ENZO: ah! jacques! 
ENZO: don't be sad, i only took back what was mine.
ENZO: here, it's a present.
JACQUES: ... thank you.
ENZO: tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite?
JOHANA: okay.
ENZO: tell me... can you explain why you are soaking wet?
JOHANA: ... we're in training.

NOVELLI: mr. roberto, tell your brother to be reasonable. everyone is waiting for him upstairs. the photographers are there, the press... 
ROBERTO: he can't, he's indisposed.
NOVELLI: shall we call a doctor?
ROBERTO: no, it's okay. mamma is going to try something.
NOVELLI: mr. mayol, help us. he refuses to receive his medal and everybody is waiting for him up there. we already have problems with the press because of the danger, and if we don't even have the divers help...!
JACQUES: ... i'll do my best.
NOVELLI: that's very kind of you.
JACQUES: it's jacques... mayol!
ENZO: jacques! my friend! come on in!
NOVELLI: mr. enzo molinari, allow me to impress upon you the importance of your attending the award ceremony...
ENZO: i think my brother told you i was indisposed, that should do it, no? i'm allowed to be indisposed, right? so, you just tell the press that the "big" enzo molinari, overwhelmed by his inspiring descent to 324 feet, will not be able to receive this trinket because he is...
ENZO: because he is?!
ONE OF THE THREE MEN: ... indisposed.
ENZO: brave!

JACQUES: tell me, why don't you go and get your medal? 
ENZO: because pasta should be eaten "al dente". so the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
ENZO: mamma! la pasta?!
MAMMA MOLINARI: arrivo! arrivo!
ENZO: ... it's easy. you go down. you come up. ... right, johana?
JOHANA: congratulations, enzo.
ENZO: don't you agree, jacques?
JACQUES: ... you always were the best.
ENZO: ah! la pasta!
MAMMA MOLINARI: buon appetito, signorina!
ENZO: what's the matter? you still have a bunch of things to ask me? you want to know the price of tea in china of how we landed on the moon? is that it?
JACQUES: no, i have to ask you a favor... you're the only one who'll understand.
ENZO: ... i'm listening.

MAMMA MOLINARI: tutto va bene? 
NOVELLI: gracie mille, chignora.

ENZO: hey! will you slow down! when did you learn how to drive? 
JACQUES: driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
ENZO: and the lights! running lights, stealing stretchers...! you'll have us in jail.
JOHANA: enzo, stop bitching, will you?

ENZO: you can stop that now, she has all the water she needs. 
ENZO: all right, we did it. let's go back to the party.
JACQUES: just one minute.
ENZO: jacques, the dolphin is home now. and that's where we're going. come on! hurry up now. our girlfriend is freezing over there.

JOHANA: well, good night, then... 
ENZO: you going to sleep here, all by yourself?
JOHANA: yes...
JOHANA: ... it's a comfortable place.
ENZO: sinister is what i'd call it...! ours is so much cheerful! why don't you come and stay with me... there's plenty of room in my suite.
JOHANA: the mamma's there too.
ENZO: yes, the mamma is is there.
JOHANA: good night enzo, good night jacques.
JACQUES: good night.
ENZO: you don't need a stretcher to take her with you. you know that, don't you?
JACQUES: what?
ENZO: the dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
JOHANA: leave it alone, enzo, it's okay.

JOHANA: can i come watch you dive tomorrow? 
JACQUES: uh... yes, of course!
ENZO: you really do have a few things to learn about women!

JOHANA: what are they for? 
NOVELLI: they're paramedics. they wait at 180 feet.
JOHANA: if there was a problem, they could do something right?
NOVELLI: of course, that's what they're for.
JOHANA: ... and those?
NOVELLI: those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet. they dive with a helium-oxygen mixture. at that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
JOHANA: what's that little air bottle on the machine?
NOVELLI: that isn't for the divers actually. it's for the balloon. it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator. without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
JOHANA: but doesn't jacques dive without anything?
NOVELLI: yes... it's magic.

JOHANA: jacques, listen to the applause. 
JOHANA: jacques, you set a world record.
JACQUES: i did?
JOHANA: aren't you happy? don't you feel proud...? i feel proud and all i did was watch.

ENZO: congratulations jacques! it's wonderful! wonderful! 
ENZO: i'm happy for you!
ENZO: here... here...
JACQUES: what is it?
ENZO: little presents, nothing much... i knew it, i just knew it! look here!
ENZO: roberto's watch! i won it! he bet that you couldn't beat me!
ENZO: you still collect them?
JACQUES: yes.
ENZO: you don't have that one, do you?
JACQUES: no. thank you. it's really beautiful.
ENZO: oh it's nothing. i knew it. i told roberto "he's very good that little frenchman, very good". i lost my title but i won a watch!
JOHANA: is it a poem?
ENZO: no, it's the recipe for spaghetti "frutti del mare". you see i was right in getting you out here. you're a world champion, my friend!
ENZO: it's a measuring tape.
ENZO: you see this is your record, three feet more than mine! looking at it from here, it doesn't look like much, does it? jacques looks at him without saying a word.
ENZO: keep your little measuring tape, my friend, it will be a nice souvenir when i beat you next.

JACQUES: what are you doing here? she answers in a far away voice, with the same serene sadness. 
JOHANA: i'm going to leave, jacques.
JOHANA: i'm going back home.
JACQUES: why?
JOHANA: because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
JACQUES: i'm not from the sea... i don't understand what you're talking about.
JOHANA: yes you do. you know exactly what i'm talking about. you're afraid i want to hold onto you, and i do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
JACQUES: but it's not true, i feel good with you... it feels right...
JOHANA: i've got to get back to the hotel...

JACQUES: will... will we see each other again? 
JOHANA: take good care of yourself, jacques.
JACQUES: where can i call you? johana, tell me where can i call you?

JACQUES: can i come in? 
ENZO: no problem, i enjoy talking in my sleep.
ENZO: wake me up at 11:00.
ENZO: hmmm! something wrong?
ENZO: is it the girl?
ENZO: did she leave?
ENZO: hey! i'm going to take care of you! i've got this job, on an oil rig, no sweat! i'm taking you along... come on! get your bags packed! you're coming with me, i tell you!
ENZO: we'll make a great team, the two of us. you'll see!

SUPERINTENDENT: mayol, molinari...? 
SUPERINTENDENT: we've been waiting for you for three days. goddamnit!
ENZO: is that the way you talk to the best diver in the world...? and to his friend jacques mayol!
SUPERINTENDENT: show them their quarters.
JACQUES: he doesn't like us.
ENZO: so what!? his job is to hand out the paychecks. and he does that very well, let me tell you.

ENZO: you still thinking about her? 
ENZO: don't think about her anymore! let me tell you, you're just making yourself unhappy! there are so many women in the world!
ENZO: plenty of women everywhere right?
NOIREUTER: smoking is absolutely forbidden.
ENZO: it isn't lit yet.
NOIREUTER: you shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
ENZO: listen we're not supposed to either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
NOIREUTER: the rules are the rules.
ENZO: ... what's your name again?
NOIREUTER: noireuter.
ENZO: and where did you say you were from?
NOIREUTER: i didn't say... brussels!

ENZO: ... i was seventeen, i loved her so much i tried to die for her. two years later i couldn't even remember her name! let me tell you, time erases everything! 
JACQUES: i don't want to erase anything.
ENZO: you'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
JACQUES: ... yes.
ENZO: i give you this. you're stubborn...
JACQUES: thank you.
TECHNICIAN: minus 800 feet. end of descent.

NOIREUTER: you have enough air for 15 minutes. 
ENZO: what's with the voice?
NOIREUTER: it's nothing. it's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
ENZO: and... does the voice come back?
NOIREUTER: for others, yes... for you, who knows?
ENZO: try speaking to me?
JACQUES: i don't find this funny. we were having a serious conversation.
ENZO: here, give me your finger.
NOIREUTER: is that alcohol? are you out of your mind? alcohol is strictly forbidden.
ENZO: hey! d'you have any other complaints? just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! okay?
ENZO: go on, your finger.
NOIREUTER: are you crazy? at this pressure?
JACQUES: it's very deep down here.
ENZO: come on, your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere!
ENZO: a thousand commanders and we get a belgian from alcoholic's anonymous.
UNDERWATER: enzo gets out of the diving capsule, head first.

SALLY: ... and if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you visa and i'll do the curtains on american express... for the couch there's bloomingdales... 
JOHANA: way past it.
SALLY: does that have a hidden meaning?
JOHANA: no. i'm just depressed.
SALLY: you look it too. you haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! you haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
JOHANA: i know, i know! i'm a terrible person... it's... i'm so damn, sad.
SALLY: what is it honey... the frenchy?
JOHANA: do you think i should have stayed? don't you think maybe i should have stayed? i've been a jerk, right? i should have stayed! i was supposed to be in love... i was in love! i am in love, why did i act like a he went swimming. all the man did was go swimming! i must be crazy. it was too good to be true.
SALLY: vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
DOCTOR: well miss cross, herbs aren't going to do the trick this time.
JOHANA: it's serious, right?
DOCTOR: i think so. you're pregnant... congratulations! if that's in order?
JOHANA: it's in order! thank you. thank you.
DOCTOR: i don't think it's me you have to thank.

DUFFY: good afternoon. 
JOHANA: i came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
DUFFY: yes. of course. very wise.
JOHANA: remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. well, we weren't being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me... ... do they come for lunch everyday? i really went on my own business, to see a man that i happen to be in love with... and i'm glad i did it, but i'm sorry about the policy and i'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now i don't have... one million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars. but if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and i think this is where you fire me?
DUFFY: you're right. you're fired.
JOHANA: will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? i'm pregnant.
DUFFY: the italian, i presume?
JOHANA: no. he's french, he was just in italy for the competition.
DUFFY: he seems to have won it.
JOHANA: yes, isn't it wonderful? i'm so happy. i'll bet i'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
JOHANA: bon appetit and adieu!

JACQUES: hello? 
JOHANA: it's me... johana.

JOHANA: i got fired. 
JACQUES: ... that's funny... i had this job with enzo... we got fired too.

JOHANA: it's getting light out. 
JACQUES: here, it's getting dark.
JACQUES: i've been thinking about you a lot, you know...
JOHANA: so have i. ... hello?
JACQUES: i'm still here.
JOHANA: well, then, talk to me some more.
JACQUES: ... it's hard you know. you're so far away and i don't know what else to say.
JOHANA: then, tell me a story.
JACQUES: uh... ah! a story?
JACQUES: do you know how it is? do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
JOHANA: no... tell me.
JACQUES: you go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... only then do they start coming out. they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... if it's sincere. if it's pure... they will be with you and take you away forever.

JACQUES: hello? 
JOHANA: it's me again.
JOHANA: i'm being a pain, huh?
JACQUES: ... not at all.
JOHANA: you sure?
JACQUES: absolutely positive.
JOHANA: okay. in that case... i'm at the airport in nice.
JACQUES: okay... huh, i'll be right over.

CAMERA...: until his head almost touches the lens... 
JOHANA: are you okay?
JACQUES: ... i think i love you.

JOHANA: why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here. 
JACQUES: you'll understand.
JOHANA: someone in there?

JACQUES: don't be afraid. it's my uncle... louis. 
UNCLE LOUIS: assassin!
JACQUES: uncle louis, this is my friend johana.
UNCLE LOUIS: did you buy the cassettes? the wagner, the berlioz?
JACQUES: i brought johana to meet you.
UNCLE LOUIS: are you crazy? i have no use for a woman! since my accident.
JACQUES: no, no. johana is visiting me.
JOHANA: bonjour monsieur... louis.
JACQUES: uncle louis. he's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
JOHANA: i'm very pleased to meet you, uncle louis.

UNCLE LOUIS: where are you from, henrietta? 
JACQUES: johana... new york.
UNCLE LOUIS: what kind of name is that? to be named after a city?
JACQUES: he doesn't hear too well.
JOHANA: i said i was from new york.
UNCLE LOUIS: that explains it! the best lays are from new york!
JACQUES: uncle louis!
UNCLE LOUIS: no, no. it's true. when i was in new york, oh boy! before my accident, you understand? jacques stands up and lowers the music.
JACQUES: uncle louis! johana is my friend. she's come to stay with me for a while.
UNCLE LOUIS: good. that way i'll see more of you... where are you going to stay?
JACQUES: well... here.
UNCLE LOUIS: in my apartment?
JACQUES: it's my apartment.
UNCLE LOUIS: liar! thief! torturer! when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast.
JACQUES: uncle louis, we have a guest!
UNCLE LOUIS: i'm going to put a lock on the telephone. did you bring the cassettes?

JACQUES: you think it'll be all right? 
JOHANA: it's going to be... interesting.

ROBERTO: ... it's not like him to be late. of course sometimes he doesn't show up at all. once in capri, he... 
JOHANA: we get the picture, roberto. jacques, i think louis needs help.
UNCLE LOUIS: two dollars for this! this fish wasn't caught. it died of cancer! jacques shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of interfering.
ROBERTO: here he comes!

ENZO: jacques! johana! 
JOHANA: enzo!
JACQUES: enzo!
ROBERTO: where did you get that?
ENZO: "that"! this is not a "that"... this is bonita mariposa, the famous spanish actress. ... who is going to be careful with the varnish... and who has come to spend a few days with us. where's mamma?

ENZO: he's really going totally deaf! 
UNCLE LOUIS: i'm not as deaf as you are blind, my boy! you take care of your eyes, i'll take care of my ears!
ENZO: i'm sorry uncle louis.
UNCLE LOUIS: come on, drink up, my boy! it might just save us from your
JACQUES: i'm glad you could come. i want you to meet enzo.
LAWRENCE: so you're the famous enzo molinari?
ENZO: in the flesh. i have that honor!

BONITA: you're going to live here permanently? 
JOHANA: ... maybe, if jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
BONITA: he's shy, not like enzo.
JOHANA: yes. not like enzo.
BONITA: i think, he's really nice... he's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
JOHANA: ... i'm pregnant, bonita!

BONITA: are you going to keep it? 
JOHANA: yes.
BONITA: does he know?
JOHANA: no.
BONITA: maybe you should talk to him about it.
JOHANA: i can't... i just don't know how to...
JOHANA: i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods. take leda for example, sleeping with jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... well, can you imagine leda announcing to her swan "you're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
BONITA: but your man isn't quite a
JOHANA: probably not, but i still don't have the nerve to tell him.
BONITA: well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
JOHANA: and you...? do you love enzo?
BONITA: very much, i think. but, there's going to be a problem.

ROBERTO: mamma, calimari fritti... zuppa de pesci. sono buoni. 
MAMMA MOLINARI: nothing. i'm not hungry.
ENZO: mamma, bonita is an actress like sophia loren, anna magnani...
BONITA: sarah bernardt. i sing too... a of a carmen. want to hear?
MAMMA MOLINARI: no thank you.
JACQUES: uncle louis, you remember enzo's mother signora molinari from amorgos?
UNCLE LOUIS: the whale! how could i forget? always was something fishy about that woman!
UNCLE LOUIS: what were italians doing living in greece anyway?
JACQUES: louis, we were french!
UNCLE LOUIS: that's different! what's the matter with you?
ROBERTO: mamma, pesce di spada?
UNCLE LOUIS: hey, whale! can you pass down the squids?

ENZO: a dive. 
ENZO: those frogmen doctors waiting around at 200 feet they just kill your concentration.
NOVELLI: they're required by law.
ENZO: there's no law down there! the only law is what your lungs can take. ... have fun! they waiting for you down there, to take the temperature of your ass. he keeps on walking across the boat, runs into jacques, who's just about to begin his yoga preparation.
ENZO: anybody can have a bad day!
JACQUES: i've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
ENZO: it's never the sea! it's roberto, mamma, that stupid actress... oh jacques, what do you know? go do your hindu exercises and don't break my balls!

JOHANA: well, how was it? 
JACQUES: enzo had a bad day.
JOHANA: and you?
JACQUES: i didn't dive.
JOHANA: you'll try again tomorrow?
JACQUES: i don't know... it didn't feel right. i'm going to bed. i'm tired.
JOHANA: you forgot your magazine! he hasn't heard.
JACQUES: what?
JOHANA: ... nothing.

BONITA: i wanted to say goodbye, johana. they kiss each other goodbye. 
JOHANA: you're leaving?
BONITA: yes... could you please give this to enzo.
JOHANA: of course.
BONITA: it's no use... just tell him i said goodbye... and give him a kiss for me, okay?
JOHANA: bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
BONITA: i don't have the strength to fight off la mamma... anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
BONITA: did you tell him?
JOHANA: not yet... i'm waiting for the right moment.
BONITA: ... you take care of yourself, johana.

JACQUES: good huh? 
LAWRENCE: he really was unbelievable, 328 feet, deeper than the world record... ... and, jacques! he held his breath for four minutes and fifty seconds!
JACQUES: good... i guess i have tomorrow's work cut out for me as enzo would say...
LAWRENCE: you must be very careful, jacques. at these depths, to hold your breath for over five minutes is... you'd really be pushing it. i think it's very, very dangerous. jacques sees enzo being carried past on the shoulders of the crowd. he ignores lawrence, runs beside enzo.
JACQUES: enzo, enzo! congratulations!

ENZO: thank you, thank you very much! 
NOVELLI: ... now i'm sure you've heard that some people have suggested it is too dangerous for us to continue. dangerous, because we don't know how to measure the physiological consequences of this type of dive and also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below 300 feet.
NOVELLI: but, we polled the free divers and they insist that the competition continue!
ENZO: good luck to you all!

ENZO: fabulous, what a dive, huh? roberto smiles. 
ENZO: he's right. what's the point of knocking yourself out?

JOHANA: what are you doing? 
JACQUES: i'm putting you on the coin... your essence... that way you'll always be with me when i dive.

NOVELLI: 360 feet! he dove 360 feet!!! the crowd cheers in excitement. 
JACQUES: ... there's a party at the hotel tonight.
ENZO: that's good.
JACQUES: enzo, don't be angry. i was lucky... that's all.
ENZO: i'll see you in amorgos. enzo turns around and jumps onto his boat. jacques walks off the dock, past the cab. johana opens the door to let him in, but he keeps walking.
JOHANA: jacques...?
JACQUES: you go back, i'll walk.

JACQUES: i won today. i dove very deep, tina. 
JACQUES: what's so funny? can you dive deeper? the dolphin nods "yes".
JACQUES: so you understand everything?
JACQUES: that's good... so tell me why they're all angry at me? why is enzo angry? i never wanted to compete with him. i never wanted to be champion of anything... all i want is to escape from them all... for just a few minutes, no people... no noise... nothing but the sea.
JACQUES: do you really understand me? huh? are we actually having a conversation here?
JACQUES: all right then, tell me: can i ever dive as deep as you? stay under as long...?
JACQUES: are you sure?

JACQUES: it's beautiful, isn't it? 
JACQUES: what's wrong?
JOHANA: it's nothing. just the long trip.
JACQUES: you want to lie down for a while?
JOHANA: no, i'll be fine. can you just hand me a glass of water?

ENZO: is he here? 
ROBERTO: he's training.

ENZO: okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk. 
JOHANA: what are you doing here?
ENZO: checking out the competition.
JOHANA: enzo, why do you guys do this?
ENZO: what else is there?
JOHANA: you know what i'm talking about. why do you and jacques risk your lives diving?
ENZO: you risk your life when you cross the street.
JOHANA: it! why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
ENZO: because you'd laugh.
JOHANA: i won't, i swear.
ENZO: i dive in search of if i go deep enough i'm going to find him. to me, the sea is a religion... that surprises you, doesn't it?
JOHANA: a little... you think it's the same for jacques?
ENZO: no. jacques is a creature of the sea. he isn't meant to live on earth, among us... you should know this, johana.
JOHANA: he can learn. he is learning.
ENZO: you really think so? did you tell him you were pregnant?
JOHANA: how do you know that?
ENZO: you told bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
JOHANA: ... not yet.
ENZO: don't.
JOHANA: why?
ENZO: because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. and he's only waiting for one thing: that some up there will turn him into a fish! how long has that moron been down there?
JOHANA: five minutes and fifty seconds.
ENZO: that
JOHANA: is he alright? what happened?
ENZO: the fool was asleep! if i weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! is that who you want to live with? well, good luck! you better learn to look after him because i won't always be here to do it!
JACQUES: ... how long was i asleep?
ENZO: long enough to die. listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
ENZO: i'll never let you take away my title. d'you hear me? never!

JOHANA: do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be? 
JACQUES: ... sure.
JOHANA: ... when you dive... with that machine... what does it feel like?
JACQUES: ... the feeling of slipping without falling... the hardest is once you are at the bottom.
JOHANA: why?
JACQUES: because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... and i always have a hard time finding one. johana has never looked so sad and lost. jacques doesn't notice.
ENZO: ... you should start playing the piano, the piano is really refreshing, it clears the sinuses. very good the piano! tomorrow is going to be a big day!

JACQUES: enzo? enzo... i know you're angry at me. enzo, it's important. 
ENZO: i'm concentrating.
JACQUES: we can't dive anymore. they want to cancel the competition for a while.
JACQUES: it's not safe, they say. the doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. free diving is over as a sport.
ENZO: you say that because you have the title!
JACQUES: no! i would never cheat you.
ENZO: well that's very nice of you.

ENZO: you were right. 
JACQUES: ... i was right about what?
ENZO: ... it is much better down there. it's a better place.
ENZO: ... push me back in the water...
JACQUES: i can't.
ENZO: jacques, take me back down... please.
LAWRENCE: just give him five minutes! what does it matter now, anyway... come on, just leave him alone!

LAWRENCE: take this. have a good sleep. 
LAWRENCE: sweet dreams.
JACQUES: kiss me. johana bends over and kisses him.
JOHANA: sleep now. we'll talk later.

JOHANA: i'll go see how he's doing. 
LAWRENCE: let him sleep.

JOHANA: jacques... are you alright? 
JOHANA: you've got to tell me what happened?
JACQUES: i saw how it has to be.
JOHANA: jacques, you know i love you.
JACQUES: don't be sad... it's not because of you, it's me. it's all going on inside me! i've gotta go and see.
JOHANA: see what? there is nothing to see! it's pitch black down there! it's cold. you'll be all alone! look at me, jacques! i am here! i exist! look!!! i'm real! i am not a dream! jacques will you look at me? please!
JOHANA: jacques? i'm pregnant.
JACQUES: that's good... that's wonderful.
JOHANA: you are the father.
JOHANA: i lied... to keep you here.
JOHANA: promise me one thing.
JACQUES: anything.
JOHANA: promise you won't forget me.
