A PICK: splitting a rock. 
BLACK: the last of the voices fades.

EVERETT: say, uh, any a you boys smithies? the hobos stare. 
EVERETT: or, if not smithies per se, were you otherwise trained in the metallurgic arts before straitened circumstances forced you into a life of aimless wanderin'?

EVERETT: - can't i count on you people? 
DELMAR: sorry, everett.
EVERETT: all right - if we take off through that bayou-
PETE: wait a minute! who elected you leader a this outfit?
EVERETT: well, pete, i just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. but if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
PETE: suits me! i'm votin' for yours truly!
EVERETT: well i'm votin' for yours truly too! both men look interrogatively to delmar.
DELMAR: okay - i'm with you fellas.
EVERETT: mind if we join you, ol' timer?
OLD MAN: join me, my sons.
DELMAR: you work for the railroad, grandpa?
OLD MAN: i work for no man.
PETE: got a name, do ya?
OLD MAN: i have no name.
EVERETT: well, that right there may be why you've had difficulty finding gainful employment. ya see, in the mart of competitive commerce, the-
OLD MAN: you seek a great fortune, you three who are now in chains...
OLD MAN: and you will find a fortune - though it will not be the fortune you seek...
OLD MAN: ...but first, first you must travel a long and difficult road - a road fraught with peril, uh-huh, and pregnant with adventure. you shall see things wonderful to tell. you shall see a cow on the roof of a cottonhouse, uh-huh, and oh, so many startlements...
OLD MAN: ...i cannot say how long this road shall be. but fear not the obstacles in your path, for fate has vouchsafed your reward. and though the road may wind, and yea, your hearts grow weary, still shall ye foller the way, even unto your salvation.

DELMAR: how'd he know about the treasure? 
EVERETT: don't know, delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. it's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
PETE: he said we wouldn't get it! he said we wouldn't get the treasure we seek!
EVERETT: well what does he know - he's an ignorant old man! pete, i'm telling you i buried it myself, and if your cousin still runs this-here horse farm and has a forge and some shoein' impediments to restore our liberty of movement-

PROPRIETOR: watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. now, if you want dapper dan i can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
EVERETT: well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! forget it! just the dozen hairnets!

EVERETT: it didn't look like a one-horse town... 
EVERETT: ...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
DELMAR: gopher, everett?
EVERETT: and no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
PETE: huh?! they dam that river on the 21st. today's the 17th!
EVERETT: don't i know it.
PETE: we got but four days to get to that treasure! after that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
PETE: we ain't gonna make it walkin'.
DELMAR: gopher, everett?
EVERETT: well, you're right there, but the ol' tactician's already got a plan-
EVERETT: -for the transportation, that is; i don't know how i'm gonna keep my coiffure in order.
PETE: how's this a plan? how're we gonna get a car?
EVERETT: sell that. i figured it could only have painful associations for wash.
PETE: to washington bartholomew hogwallop. from his loving cora. ay-more fie- dellis.
EVERETT: it was in his bureau. he screws the lid back on the pomade.
DELMAR: you got light fingers, everett. gopher?
PETE: you mis'able little sneak thief...
PETE: you stole from my kin!
EVERETT: who was fixing to betray us!
PETE: you didn't know that at the time!
EVERETT: so i borrowed it till i did know!
PETE: that don't make no sense!
EVERETT: pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. what the hell's that singing?
VOICE: oh brothers, let's go down, come on down, don't you wanna go down...
VOICES: oh brothers, let's go down, down to the river to pray...
DELMAR: appears to be... some kinda... con- gur-gation. care for some gopher?
EVERETT: no, thank you delmar - a third of a gopher would only rouse my appetite without beddin' her back down.
DELMAR: you can have the whole thing - me'n pete already had one...
VOICES: oh, sisters, let's go down, come on down, don't you want to go down...
DELMAR: we ran acrost a gopher village...
WOMAN: come with us, brothers! join us and be saved!

VOICES: we went down to the river one day, studying about that good old way, and who shall wear that robe and crown, oh lord, show us the way... 
EVERETT: i guess hard times flush the chumps. everybody's lookin' for answers, and there's always-
EVERETT: where the hell's he goin'?
PETE: well, i'll be a delmar's been saved!
EVERETT: pete, don't be ignorant- delmar is slogging back through the water.
DELMAR: well that's it boys, i been redeemed! the preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. it's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
EVERETT: delmar what the are you talking about? - we got bigger fish to fry-
DELMAR: preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that piggly wiggly i knocked over in yazoo!
EVERETT: i thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
DELMAR: well i was lyin' - and i'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too! neither nor man's got nothin' on me now! come on in, boys, the water's fine!

PETE: the preacher said it absolved us. 
EVERETT: for him, not for the law! i'm surprised at you, pete. hell, i gave you credit for more brains than delmar.
DELMAR: but there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
EVERETT: that's not the issue, delmar. even if it did put you square with the lord, the state of mississippi is more hardnosed.
DELMAR: you should a joined us, everett. it couldn't a hurt none.
PETE: hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
EVERETT: join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? thank you anyway. and i like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
EVERETT: baptism. you two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. well, i guess you're my cross to bear-
DELMAR: pull over, everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
HITCHHIKER: you folks goin' through tishamingo?
DELMAR: sure, hop in.
EVERETT: how ya doin', boy? name's everett, and these two soggy are pete and delmar. keep your fingers away from pete's mouth-he ain't had nothin' to eat for the last thirteen years but prison food, gopher, and a little greasy horse.
HITCHHIKER: thank you fuh the lif', suh. m'names tommy. tommy johnson.
DELMAR: how ya doin', tommy. i haven't seen a house in miles. what're you doin' out in the middle of nowhere?
TOMMY: i had to be at that crossroads las' midnight to sell mah soul to the devil.
EVERETT: well ain't it a small world, spiritually speakin'! pete and delmar just been baptized and saved! i guess i'm the only one here who remains unaffiliated!
DELMAR: this ain't no laughin' matter, everett.
EVERETT: what'd the devil give you for your soul, tommy?
TOMMY: he taught me to play this guitar real good.
DELMAR: oh, son! for that you traded your everlastin' soul?!
TOMMY: i wudden usin' it.
PETE: i always wondered-what's the devil look like?
EVERETT: well, of course there's all manner of lesser imps'n demons, pete, but the great satan hisself is red and scaly with a bifurcated tail and carries a hayfork.
TOMMY: oh no! no suh! he's white-white as you folks, with mirrors for eyes an' a big hollow voice an' allus travels with a mean old hound.
PETE: and he told you to go to tishamingo?
TOMMY: no suh, that was mah idea. i heard they's a man there pays folks money to sing into a can. they say he pays extra effen you play real good.
EVERETT: how much does he pay?

EVERETT: who's the honcho around here? 
MAN: i am. hur you?

EVERETT: sir, the soggy bottom boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
PETE: that's right!
DELMAR: that's right! we ain't really negroes!
PETE: all except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!

EVERETT: hot damn, boy, i almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil! 
MAN: boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. you just sign these papers and i'll give you ten dollars apiece.
EVERETT: okay sir, but mert and aloysius'll have to scratch xes - only four of us can write.

DELMAR: hey mister! i don't mean to be tellin' tales out a school, but there's a man in there hands out ten dollars to anyone sings into his can! 
PAPPY: i'm not here to make a record, ya cracker, they broadcast me out on the radio.
JUNIOR: that's governor menelaus 'pass the biscuits, pappy' o'daniel, and he'd sure 'preciate it if you ate his farina and voted him a second term.
ECKARD: finest governor we've ever had in m'sippi.
SPIVEY: in any state.
ECKARD: oh lord yes, any parish'r precinct; i was makin' the larger point.
JUNIOR: aintcha gonna press the flesh, pappy, do a little politickin'?
PAPPY: i'll press your flesh, you dimwitted - you don't tell your pappy how to cawt the elect 'rate!
PAPPY: we ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!

PETE: an' all my meals for free...
EVERETT: what about you, delmar? what're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
DELMAR: visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the indianola savings and loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
PETE: what about you, everett? what'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
EVERETT: me? oh, i didn't have no plan. still don't, really.
PETE: well that hardly sounds like you...

MAN: it's either the penal farm or the fires of damnation-makes no nevermind to me!
DELMAR: we gotta skedaddle!

DELMAR: don't be a fool, everett, we gotta r- u-n-o-f-f-t, but pronto!
EVERETT: where's tommy?
PETE: already lit out, scared out of his wits. let's go!
DAYTIME ROAD: the three men shuffle down the dusty road.
PETE: the it ain't square one! ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
EVERETT: pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark i don't intend to dignify with comment, but i would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. consider the lilies a the field, or-hell!- take a look at delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
DELMAR: yeah, look at me.
EVERETT: now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. you may call it obtuse. but the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
EVERETT: ...close to... three days... before they dam that river...
DRIVER: is this the road to itta bena?
PETE: uh... itta bena...
EVERETT: itta bena, now, uh, that would be...

EVERETT: well ya know, delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. yep, it's like our friend george is a alley cat and his own humors're swingin' him by the tail. but don't worry, delmar; he'll be back on top again. i don't think we've heard the last of george nelson.
DELMAR: i liked george.

EVERETT: ladies, you'll have to pardon my friend here; pete is dirt-ignorant and unschooled in the social arts. my name on the other hand is ulysses everett mcgill and you ladies are about the three prettiest water lilies it's ever been my privilege to admire.
EVERETT: why, thank you dear, that's very, uh...

DELMAR: we gotta find some kinda wizard can change 'im back! a beat. delmar continues to whimper.
EVERETT: ...i'm just not sure that's pete.

EVERETT: you can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed! 
DELMAR: i just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
EVERETT: well if that is pete i am ashamed of him. the way i see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some a babylon. these things- he points a knife at the shoebox.
EVERETT: -don't happen for no reason, delmar. obviously it's some kind of judgment on pete's character.

BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR: still heatedly discussing. 
DELMAR: the two of us was fixing to fornicate!
EVERETT: heh-heh. you'll have to excuse my rusticated friend here, unaccustomed as he is to city manners.
EVERETT: well mamzel i guess we'll have a couple a steaks and some gratinated potatoes and wash it down with your finest bubbly wine-

BACK TO EVERETT AND DELMAR: as everett closes his menu. 
EVERETT: ...and i don't suppose the chef'd have any nits or grubs in the pantry, or - naw, never mind, just bring me a couple leafs a raw cabbage.
WAITRESS: yes sir.
BIG MAN: don't believe i've seen you boys around here before! allow me t'innerduce myself: name of daniel teague, known in these precincts as big dan teague or, to those who're pressed for time, big dan toot court.
EVERETT: how d'you do, big dan. i'm ulysses everett mcgill; this is my associate delmar o'donnell. i sense that, like me, you are endowed with the gift of gab.
BIG DAN: i flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. the one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
EVERETT: once again we find ourselves in agreement. what kind of work do you do, big dan?
BIG DAN: sales, mr. mcgill, sales! and what do i sell? the truth! ever' blessed word of it, from genesee on down to revelations! that's right, the word of which let me add there is good money in during these days of woe and want! folks're lookin' for answers and big dan teague sells the only book that's got 'em! what do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
DELMAR: uh, we uh-
EVERETT: we're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well.
BIG DAN: i like your style, young man, so i'm gonna propose you a proposition. you cover my check so i don't have to run back up to my room, have your waitress wrap your dinner picnic- style, and we'll retire to more private environs where i will explain to you how vast amounts of money can be made in the service of amighty.
EVERETT: well, why not. if nothing else i could use some civilized conversation.
BIG DAN: don't forget your shoebox, friend.

PAPPY: languishing! campaign is languishing! we need a shot inna arm! hear me, boys? inna arm! election held tomorra, that stokes would win it in a walk! 
JUNIOR: well he's the reform candidate, daddy.
PAPPY: ...yeah?
JUNIOR: well people like that reform. maybe we should get us some.
PAPPY: i'll reform you, you soft-headed how we gonna run reform when we're the incumbent!
PAPPY: zat the best idea any you boys can come up with? reeform?! weepin' on the cross! eckard, you may as well start draftin' my concession speech right now.
ECKARD: okay, pappy.
PAPPY: i'm just makin' a point, you stupid
ECKARD: okay, pappy.
ECKARD: pappy just makin' a point here, boys.

BIG DAN: thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. i'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt i was feeling a mite peckish. 
EVERETT: our pleasure, big dan.
BIG DAN: and thank you as well for that conversational hiatus; i generally refrain from speech while engaged in gustation. there are those who attempt both at the same time but i find it course and vulgar. now where were we?
DELMAR: makin' money in the lord's service.
BIG DAN: you don't say much friend, but when you do it's to the point and i salute you for it.
DELMAR: oh, it weren't nothin', i-
BIG DAN: yes, bible sales. the trade is not a complicated one; there're but two things to learn. one bein' where to find your wholesaler - word of in bulk as it were. two bein' how to reckanize your customer - who're you dealin' with? - an exercise in psychology so to speak.
BIG DAN: and it is that which i propose to give you a lesson in right now.
EVERETT: i like to think that i'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
BIG DAN: no doubt, brother - i figured as much back there in the restaurant. that's why i invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
EVERETT: ...what's goin' on, big dan?
EVERETT: big dan, what're you doin'?
BIG DAN: it's all about money, boys! atsy answer! dough re mi!
BIG DAN: do unto others before they do unto you!
BIG DAN: i'll just take your show cards...
BIG DAN: ...and whatever you got in the hole.
BIG DAN: what the...
BIG DAN: it's nothin' but a toad!
DELMAR: no... you don't understand...
BIG DAN: don't you boys know these things give ya warts?

DELMAR: we didn't abandon you, pete, we just thought you was a toad.
PETE: no, they never did turn me into a toad.

DELMAR: everett, my beard itches.
PETE: this is crazy. no one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
EVERETT: no, this is gonna work! i just gotta get close enough to talk to her. takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named waldrip. i'm bona fide. i've got the answers!

WALDRIP: well that's a improper suggestion! i can't switch sides in the middle of a campaign! especially to work for a man who lacks moral fibre! 
PAPPY: moral fibre?!
PAPPY: you pasty-faced i invented moral fibre!
PAPPY: pappy o'daniel was displayin' rectitude and high-mindedness when that pencil-neck you work for was still messin' his drawers!

STOKES: wait a minute! wait a minute! is you is or is you ain't my constichency?

STOKES: is you is or is you ain't - 
PAPPY: goddamn! oppitunity knocks!
PAPPY: that's fine, that's fine!...
PAPPY: ...ladies'n gentlemens here and listenin' at home, the great state of mississippi thanks the soggy bottom boys for that won-a-ful performance!
PAPPY: now it looks like the only man in our great state who ain't a music luvva, is my esteemed opponent in the upcomin', homer stokes - boos.
PAPPY: yeah, well, they ain't no accountin' f'taste. it sounded t'me like he harbored some kind a hateful grudge against the soggy bottom boys on account a their rough'n rowdy past.
PAPPY: sounds like homer stokes is the kinda fella gonna cast the first stone!
PAPPY: well i'm with you folks. i'm a f'give and f'get christian. and i say, well, if their rambunctiousness and misdemeanorin' is behind 'em - it is, ain't it, boys?
EVERETT: sure is, governor.
PAPPY: why then i say, by the par vested in me, these boys is hereby pardoned!
PAPPY: and furthermore, in the second pappy o'daniel administration, why, these boys - is gonna be my brain trust! raucous cheers.
DELMAR: what sat mean exactly, everett?
EVERETT: well, you'n me'n pete'n tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
DELMAR: oh, okay.
PAPPY: so now, without further ado, and by way of endorsin' my candidacy, the soggy bottom boys is gonna lead us all in a chorus of 'you are my sunshine' - ain't ya, boys?
EVERETT: ...governor - that's one of our favorites!
PAPPY: son, you gonna go far.

EVERETT: i guess vernon t. waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. maybe i'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs. 
DELMAR: is the marriage off then, miz wharvey?
PENNY: mcgill. no, the marriage'll take place as planned.
EVERETT: just a little change of cast. me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. you boys're invited, of course. hell, you're best men! already got the rings.
EVERETT: where's your ring, honey?
PENNY: i ain't worn it since our divorce came through. it must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. never thought i'd need it; vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
EVERETT: hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
PENNY: we ain't gettin' married with his ring! you said you'd changed!
EVERETT: aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
PENNY: ain't gonna be no weddin'.
EVERETT: it's just a symbol, honey -
PENNY: no weddin'.
DELMAR: we'll go fetch it with ya, everett.
EVERETT: honey, it's just - shutup, delmar - it's just -
PENNY: i have spoken my piece and counted to three.
EVERETT: oh, goddamnit! she counted to three! you know how far that cabin is?!
DELMAR: george!
GEORGE: 'lo, boys! well, these little men finally caught up with the criminal a the century! looks like the chair for george nelson. yup! gonna electrify me! i'm gonna go off like a roman candle! twenty thousand volts chasin' the rabbit through yours truly! gonna shoot sparks out the top of my head and lightning from my fingertips!
GEORGE: yessir! gonna all the power right outa the state! goddamn, boys, i'm on top of the world! i'm george

EVERETT: well, at least you boys'll get to see the old manse - the home where i spent so many happy days in the bosom of my family - a refugium, if you will - with a mighty oak tree out front and a happy little tire swing... 
DELMAR: where's the happy little tire swing?
COOLEY: end of the road, boys. it's had its twists and turns -
EVERETT: waitaminute -
COOLEY: - but now it deposits you here.
EVERETT: waitaminute -
COOLEY: you have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. tie their hands, boys.
EVERETT: you can't do this -
COOLEY: didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend. well, he'll have to wait his turn -
EVERETT: hang on there -
COOLEY: - and share one of your graves.
EVERETT: you can't do this - we just been pardoned! by the governer himself!
DELMAR: it went out over the radio!
COOLEY: is that right?
COOLEY: ...too bad we don't have a radio.
PETE: have mercy!
TOMMY: it ain't fittin'!
EVERETT: it ain't the law!
COOLEY: the law. well the law is a human institution.
COOLEY: perhaps you should take a moment for your prayers.
PETE: oh my everett!
DELMAR: i'm sorry we got you into this, tommy.
PETE: good lord, what do we do?
EVERETT: oh lord, please look down and recognize us poor sinners... please lord...
EVERETT: ...i just want to see my daughters again. oh lord, i've been separated from my family for so long...
EVERETT: ...i know i've been guilty of pride and sharp dealing. i'm sorry that i turned my back on you, lord. please forgive me, and help us, lord, and i swear i'll mend my ways... for the sake of my family... for tommy's sake, and delmar's, and pete's...
EVERETT: ...let me see my daughters again. please, lord, help us... please help us... the rumble erupts into a deafening roar. a wall of water is crashing through the hollow.

DELMAR: a miracle! it was a miracle! 
EVERETT: aw, don't be ignorant, delmar. i told you they was gonna flood this valley.
DELMAR: that ain't it!
PETE: we prayed to and he pitied us!
EVERETT: it just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. there's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
PETE: that ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
EVERETT: well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. no, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
EVERETT: yessir, the south is gonna change. everything's gonna be put on electricity and run on a payin' basis. out with the old spiritual mumbo- jumbo, the superstitions and the backward ways. we're gonna see a brave new world where they run everyone a wire and hook us all up to a grid. yessir, a veritable age of reason - like the one they had in france - and not a moment too soon... his voice trails off as he notices something.
EVERETT: not a moment too soon. say, there's tommy!
EVERETT: what you ridin' there, tommy?
TOMMY: rolltop desk...

EVERETT: all's well that ends well, as the poet says. 
PENNY: that's right, honey.
EVERETT: but i don't mind telling you, i'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
EVERETT: ...time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
PENNY: that's good, honey.
EVERETT: and you were right about that ring. any other weddin' band would not do. but this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence - he is slipping it onto her hand.
PENNY: that's not my ring.
EVERETT: - in the gods - huh?
PENNY: that's not my ring.
EVERETT: not your...
PENNY: that's one of aunt hurlene's.
EVERETT: you said it was in the rolltop desk!
PENNY: i said i thought it was in the rolltop desk.
EVERETT: you said -
PENNY: or, it might a been under the mattress.
EVERETT: you -
PENNY: or in my chiffonier. i don't know.
EVERETT: well, i'm sorry honey -
PENNY: well, we need that ring.
EVERETT: well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
PENNY: uh-huh.
EVERETT: a 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
PENNY: i don't care if it's ninety thousand.
EVERETT: yes, but honey -
PENNY: that wasn't my doing...
EVERETT: course not, honey, but...
PENNY: i counted to three, honey.
EVERETT: well sure, honey, but...
EVERETT: ...finding one little ring in the middle of all that water...
EVERETT: ...that is one of a heroic task...
