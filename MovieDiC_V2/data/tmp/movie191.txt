REYNOLDS: "i know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. and thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". 
HAMERSLEY: what the does it mean?
REYNOLDS: it means who's side are you on?
HAMERSLEY: you didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a bible study class.
REYNOLDS: it's a bi-partisan issue. everyone needs to swallow hard. no one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
HAMERSLEY: you.
REYNOLDS: what?
HAMERSLEY: i said you.
REYNOLDS: is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
HAMERSLEY: you're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism?

VOICE: senator albert's office-- the line goes dead. 
OLDER MAN: i don't know how much longer we can hold out, mr. dean.
DEAN: i don't know, either, l.t. maybe you guys should get yourself a labor lawyer.
L.T.: well that's why i'm here, mr. dean.
DEAN: good point.
L.T.: last night, larry spinks, he works the steel press, he goes to a bar with his wife rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
DEAN: l.t., in this office i'd prefer you say italian-americans.
L.T.: i'm sorry, mr. dean. but larry's in st. lukes now, so i'm a little--i'm not myself. the union bosses say unless we take bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
DEAN: that's because your union bosses
DEAN: the union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
L.T.: why would the union--
DEAN: because they've been paid off by bellmoth.
L.T.: mr. dean--
DEAN: my name's bobby. i'm your lawyer. don't do anything 'till i talk to you.
DEAN: martha!
DEAN: larry spinks, st. lukes. send him a case of chianti from the firm. and send his wife rosalie some flowers.

RACHEL: it's how he works.
DEAN: brill?
RACHEL: yes.
DEAN: so you've said.
DEAN: ten thousand cash. i don't know if it's brill's prices going up or your commission.
RACHEL: i take a straight 15 percent. brill's fee varies with risk. perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
DEAN: other than brill.
RACHEL: other than me.
DEAN: why would i--
RACHEL: someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
DEAN: i
DEAN: i just want to make sure i'm not breaking the law.

DEPINTO: this is you don't know
DEPINTO: you're goddam right you jumped the gun.
DEAN: that's probably not you in the picture. i tell you what, i'll just run the thing by the grand jury, see if they can't--

DEAN: why?

BLAKE: i'm told you had an affair with rachel banks four years ago.

DEAN: really?
BLAKE: yes.
DEAN: well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, david, maybe i'd do best to simply kick your all over the capitol.
SILVERBERG: gentlemen--
DEAN: this is

"BRILL": don't me, i can save your life.
DEAN: i'm telling you, i--
DEAN: i just gave him my card.
"BRILL": he didn't give you an address? he didn't give you a phone number?
DEAN: nothing. two nights later i was
DEAN: um...who's that?
"BRILL": don't know. did you check everywhere? maybe it was hidden in something.
DEAN: someone else?
"BRILL": maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
"BRILL": 
"BRILL": 209 to anyone! i need some help here!
DEAN: who are you calling?!

DEAN: stacy, don't hang up. 
STACY: do you know what i'm looking at robert?
DEAN: stacy--
STACY: i'm looking at a picture of you and rachel taken
STACY: was that doctored-up, too?
DEAN: no, i was with her yesterday. i want you to take eric and go to our parents house. i want you to do it right now.
STACY: i went to the grocery store. my atm and credit cards didn't work. i couldn't buy food.
DEAN: i know.
STACY: i went to the bank to see why. they said you emptied our accounts--
DEAN: it wasn't me.
STACY: this is science-fiction robert! the manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
DEAN: stacy, somebody's trying to kill me.
STACY: my father's put me in touch with an attorney. he'll be--
MAN: put the phone down. do as i say.
DEAN: alright, alright--
MAN: move to the elevators.

REYNOLDS: 30 minutes ago you said we had him. 
HICKS: he had help.
REYNOLDS: help from whom? christ.

DEAN: hey! 
MAN: forget me, forget what i did for you. don't
DEAN: you're brill.
BRILL: you knew the deal. no contact.
DEAN: who was that other guy?
BRILL: one of many people who would live a word with you.
DEAN: who are they?
BRILL: you've heard of the national security agency?
DEAN: what do they have to do with this?
BRILL: that's who they are.
DEAN: the nsa?
BRILL: yes.
DEAN: you're crazy.
BRILL: okay.
DEAN: wait.
BRILL: you drive a black bmw, license plate srk1339?
DEAN: yeah.
BRILL: i clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away. brill pulls out a disk-shaped object the size of a walk-man.
DEAN: what
DEAN: i don't know what that means.
BRILL: like a lowjack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. it pulses at 230 giga-hertz.
DEAN: i don't know what that means.
BRILL: 230 giga-hertz. they use that band for the aquacade spy-sat uplinks.
DEAN: i don't know what that means.
BRILL: it means the nsa can read the time off your wristwatch.
DEAN: why are they after
BRILL: pal, you're cooked. it's over. what you did, who you were...that's done. i'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
DEAN: why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
BRILL: they're spooks.
DEAN: i don't know what that--
BRILL: exposure. they can't have it. they wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
DEAN: i don't know
DEAN: what am i gonna do?! i mean, like, for the rest of my
DEAN: what if--
BRILL: look, you gave me some work over the last year. we'll call it even.
DEAN: what if i find out what they're after. you know these people, i don't.
BRILL: and you won't. now move--
DEAN: i'll pay you.
BRILL: they froze your accounts. get outa my way.
DEAN: i've got a hundred-thousand dollars in jewelry in a safe-deposit box under a third party name.
DEAN: how many years have

VOICE: 303 to 301. floor one secured. moving to two. 
JONES: open the door, mr. dean. there's nowhere to go. we'd just like to talk. seeing a phone, dean grabs it. no tone. just a recording of nancy sinatra's song "these boots are made for walking".
JONES: it'd be easier for all of us if you just come out. nothing'll happen.
JONES: it's quite hopeless what you're doing, mr. dean.
DEAN: i swear to i'll shoot.
JONES: i think you might be over-reacting there, mr. dean. we just want to talk.
DEAN: go ahead. i hear you fine.
DEAN: i said i'll shoot! the door keeps pushing. dean fires high. the pushing stops.
A STUN GRENADE.: dean ducks as a blinding flash rocks the room.
HICKS: i don't

DEAN: tell him to stop the ambulance. 
PARAMEDIC: whoa there, fella. just take it easy.
DEAN: tell him to stop the ambulance.
PARAMEDIC: now you're a little shaken up, but we're gonna get you on your feet in--
PARAMEDIC: --stop the ambulance.
DEAN: thank you.

REYNOLDS: i sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. why can't i bring in a man whose name 
REYNOLDS: he's clever? he had help? oh.
HICKS: sir--
REYNOLDS: no, no, i'm sorry. i didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside greenland.
HICKS: i just meant--
REYNOLDS: i don't care if he's solomon with saint joseph sitting in his
WAITER: puffed cheese?
REYNOLDS: no thank you.
WAITER: i also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
REYNOLDS: do i look like i want a tiny pizza?
WAITER: no.
REYNOLDS: then let's assume i don't.
WAITER: yes sir.
REYNOLDS: now is that clear?
WAITER: yes sir.

DEAN: rachel? 
DEAN: rachel? she doesn't respond. he touches her. nothing. he turns her over. her face is frozen, eyes open, neck purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.
DEAN: oh god--

DEAN: jerry-- 
JERRY: christ!
DEAN: ssh!
JERRY: bobby--
DEAN: it's the nsa. they're the ones doing this.
JERRY: bobby--
DEAN: the nsa's doing this 'cause they think i have something. and they killed--
JERRY: calm down.
DEAN: they killed rachel.
JERRY: rachel's dead?
DEAN: yes.
JERRY: 
DEAN: my stuff's all over her apartment.
JERRY: bobby--
DEAN: they're framing me.
JERRY: why would they--
DEAN: i don't know. i mean--
JERRY: why would the nsa--
DEAN: i don't know!
JERRY: you're tired.
DEAN: jerry--
JERRY: listen to me.
DEAN: you gotta--
JERRY: no, listen to me. you gotta let me bring you in.
DEAN: no, i--
JERRY: you gotta let me bring you in to the police.
DEAN: i won't
DEAN: to the nsa. make a deal. tell 'em to stop. tell 'em i don't have what they're after. make a deal.
JERRY: bobby, you're in way over your head.
DEAN: go to 'em, jerry.
JERRY: i have a family.
DEAN: so do i!
JERRY: i'm sorry, man.
DEAN: no. no, it's okay.
JERRY: bobby? piece of advice?
DEAN: yeah?
JERRY: turn yourself in.
DEAN: jerry?
JERRY: yeah?
DEAN: go yourself.

DEAN: listen to me. the house is bugged. so we gotta be quiet, okay? 
DEAN: is eric in school?
STACY: yes.
DEAN: has anyone been by? police? fbi?
STACY: just reporters.
DEAN: i wish you'd gone to your parents like i asked you.
STACY: this is my house. nobody's kicking me out of my house. i picked those drapes.
DEAN: i don't think anybody wants the drapes, stacy, i think the drapes are okay.
STACY: what happened to your head?
DEAN: i was in a car chase and a small explosion. now listen to me: the nsa is behind this. they think that guy i told you about, daniel zavitz, they think zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. so they're doing all these things
DEAN: well...yeah.
STACY: good.
DEAN: stacy--
STACY: i
STACY: i'm sorry i didn't believe you.
DEAN: that's okay.
STACY: i opened the present you got me from harrison's.
DEAN: you opened the thing?
STACY: the lingerie.
DEAN: that was for christmas.
STACY: i was missing you.
DEAN: you're as bad as eric. i've got an entire family of people who root through--
DEAN: ...who root through...uh...presents, and...
STACY: what is it?
DEAN: oh christ.
DRIVER: 504 to 501. rover's fleeing west on sutton. driver appeared
DRIVER: she's off location with a friend.
JONES: alright - move! 501 - all units.

TRACY: eric? 
TRACY: your father's here.

ERIC: dad! 
DEAN: do i know you?
ERIC: where've you been?
DEAN: having an adventure. i can't tell you about it right now, but i'll tell you about it soon.
ERIC: are you and mom getting a divorce?
DEAN: no. we're never getting a divorce. we were having a fight. it happens sometimes.
ERIC: who won the fight?
DEAN: men don't win fights with women, son, i'll tell you about that sometime, too. in the meantime, i've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. under no circumstances will i be angry with you. this is a total get-out-of- jail-free card. ready?
ERIC: yeah.
DEAN: did you take

DYLAN: hey, mr. d., what's happenin'? 
DEAN: dylan, i was just asking eric if--
DYLAN: oh, i
DYLAN: it was broken when we found it, i swear. i tried fixing it for you. i even put in new batteries. the screen scrambles whenever you boot up. i'd try to get your money back. dean eyes the pieces of the gameboy, knowing that

BRILL: get dressed. we're leaving. 
DEAN: you could knock on the door, you know, and i'd open it.
BRILL: move it.

NEWSCASTER: dean, the attorney recently under investigation for a money laundering scheme, was seen leaving ms. banks apartment late last night. 
NEWSCASTER: police are seeking--
BRILL: i taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
DEAN: and you were worried about me.
BRILL: i was worried about my hundred and twenty 'k'.
DEAN: we said a hundred.
BRILL: the price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. but you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. i'll just let you out here.
DEAN: one-twenty. brill checks the rear-view mirror.
BRILL: did you call anyone?
DEAN: what do you mean?
BRILL: i mean did you call anyone.
DEAN: look, my wife is understandably--
BRILL: 
DEAN: i called my wife!
BRILL: what'd i tell you?
DEAN: i didn't use my name.
BRILL: what'd i tell you?
DEAN: i called from a payphone!
BRILL: what'd i tell you?
DEAN: you told me no calls.
BRILL: i told you no calls.
DEAN: sorry.
BRILL: you don't get it. they go through your phone records. they monitor everyone you called in the last--
DEAN: i didn't use my name.
BRILL: oh, i'll bet
BRILL: a hundred and fifty.

BRILL: the nsa's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. they've infected everything: banks, computers, phones, mail, name it. the more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. it's a brave new world. at least it better be. 
DEAN: how do you know so much?
BRILL: none of your business.
DEAN: you used to work for 'em, didn't you?
BRILL: i was a traffic analyst.
BRILL: i intercepted phone calls.
DEAN: how'd you get around the tap orders?
BRILL: they can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. cellulars and pagers your kid can do. hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the sats. we'd in everything. all foreign, most domestic. domestic was my group. druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. anyone we wanted.
DEAN: how'd you have the manpower to--
BRILL: meade has 18 underground acres of computers. they scan
BRILL: that was twenty years ago. with digital? they can a salt grain off a beach.
DEAN: why'd you leave?
BRILL: it was '72. i figured we had enough problems without monitoring a berkeley kid's class schedule. so i sold my story to
BRILL: well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. so they ruined my records and made sure i'd never hold a real job again.
BRILL: what do you think?
DEAN: looks like detroit.
BRILL: welcome to santa's workshop.

BRILL: i call it the jar. no phone or utility lines going in. 
BRILL: self-contained. unplugged from the world. nothing for a wire bug to piggy- back in on. that leaves only transmitters and signal sweep for those. now let's see what we got.

BRILL: that is one ugly sunrise. 
DEAN: it really is. did you find anything?
BRILL: yeah. take a walk with me.
BRILL: remember when senator hamersley died in an accident up near shenandoah?
DEAN: yeah.
BRILL: the nsa killed him.
DEAN: do you have proof?
BRILL: well, actually,
BRILL: they're here.
DEAN: who?
BRILL: them.
DEAN: where?
BRILL: here?

DEAN: 'kay, well, could you walk faster, please. 
VOICE: they're heading to the car.
JONES: move it.

BRILL: empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. and turn your head. there might be some debris flying your way. 
DEAN: why?
DEAN: what the
BRILL: they shouldn't have come without calling first.
BRILL: where's your gun?
DEAN: back at the warehouse.
DEAN: gimme that.
BRILL: you sure?
DEAN: you're driving.
BRILL: those are feds.

BRILL: think we let out enough air? 
DEAN: oh my

BRILL: we lost 'em. 
DEAN: that wasn't so hard.
BRILL: fuckin-a.
DEAN: let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
BRILL: yeah, i can see where that'd-- he stops talking.
BRILL: these guys are incredibly persistent.
DEAN: tell me about it.

BRILL: drive. 
DEAN: we're not gonna hurt you.
BRILL: drive.
DEAN: tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
BRILL: drive or i'll blow your head off.
DEAN: no he won't.
BRILL: goddammit--
DEAN: we're honest people and we need your help. i'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
GRUNGE-DUDE: take it!
DEAN: actually, i don't have two-hundred dollars.
BRILL: drive the car!

HICKS: we found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of brill's studio. one was dean's. the other, we believe, belongs to brill. 
REYNOLDS: we believe?
HICKS: well...his real name's edward lyle.
REYNOLDS: lyle?!
HICKS: yes sir.
REYNOLDS: you're kidding me.
HICKS: no sir.
REYNOLDS: dean's with lyle.
HICKS: and they have the video. that's confirmed.
REYNOLDS: so they know everything.
HICKS: if they've looked at the video.
REYNOLDS: oh, let's assume that they have.
HICKS: if he's with lyle it means he's got resources.
REYNOLDS: resources, that's a good point. he's got resources. all we've got is a

BRILL: listen to you, "directly". you're not gonna get 
BRILL: same thing?
DEAN: so what do we do now?
BRILL: i was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
DEAN: what if we do a mailing to congressmen.
BRILL: it'd never get through. all packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. you didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
DEAN: what if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
BRILL: the area's wired for surveillance, they'll be

DEAN: what if we put it on the internet? 
BRILL: have you seen how slow the net is? it'd take ten minutes to unload enough video so that people know what they're seeing, and it'd take the nsa maybe 40 seconds to see it coming down and shut down the access.
NEWSCASTER: --this will be the last stop on the senator's eight-city tour before the senate votes on tuesday.
BRILL: but maybe if there were no phone line-- dean has started listening to the radio...
BRILL: what if we transmitted it over cellular?
DEAN: listen--
BRILL: nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
DEAN: what if--
BRILL: if they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
DEAN: what if--
BRILL: they've done it before. takes maybe two minutes.
DEAN: what if--
BRILL: what if
BRILL: how?
DEAN: same way they did with you and me. we take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
BRILL: reynolds.
DEAN: no.
BRILL: who?

BRILL: you wanna get caught spying on albert? 
DEAN: no, i want the nsa to get caught spying on albert.
DEAN: we're gonna lead albert by the nose to one conclusion. and then when he's as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. how fast can you teach me what i need to know?
BRILL: how fast can you learn?

DEAN: pretty fast. 
BRILL: we'll have to re-stock some basics.
BRILL: bugs, frequency scanners, contact mics, transmitters, pin-holes, fiber optics--

BRILL: what do you know about locking cellular phone signals? 
DEAN: i know my phone number and i know the number for sportsphone. beyond that--
BRILL: 

BRILL: a 'modified' oki 900 interfaced with a lap-top creates an enormously powerful tool. i got into the software, did some code re-writing and turned it into one of the best scan-looking systems around. 
BRILL: this is every call on the grid. i can lock and position any one i want and follow the hand-offs in real time.
WOMAN'S VOICE: super shuttle.
MAN'S VOICE: this is dr. jonathan phillips, 102 stern drive in brockton. i need an airport ride on friday at 6 pm with a return pick-up monday at 5.
BRILL: need a place to stay for the weekend? a new tv?
ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE: triple-a emergency road service. may i have your name and membership number?
YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE: colleen crane. card number 020-113--
DEAN: unbelievable.
BRILL: all from a hundred dollar scanner at radio shack. but it's time for business. brill dials his computer into a new line. tones and
DEAN: what are you dialing?
BRILL: ameritech's data-base. there's albert's d.c. office address and his phone's identity code. now we just reprogram out phone with his id code and you know what we've got?
SENATOR ALBERT: --don't think it could've gone any better. tell me, how's deb? how're my grandchildren?
BRILL: a receiver tuned permanently to the senator's phone.
SENATOR'S WIFE: melissa has a fever. when will you be in the room?

CHRISTA: can you send someone up right away. i'm having a problem with my tv... it's screeching and i-- it's screeching and i-- christa is noticing that her voice is causing the tv image to distort in sync. 
CHRISTA: it's screeching and i can't turn it off.

SENATOR ALBERT: what happened to you last night? 
PATRICK: christa found it last night attached to her tv. it's a listening device.
SENATOR ALBERT: a bug?
PATRICK: yeah.
SENATOR ALBERT: h.--
PATRICK: we should everything checked. there's a company in cambridge called baudmore. they're discreet.
SENATOR ALBERT: well get somebody down here today.

DEAN: he's going into the payphone outside the restaurant. it's a cambridge company called baudmore. 
BRILL: got it.
BRILL: baudmore consultants.
PATRICK: is jerry delsano in?
BRILL: who's calling?
PATRICK: it's pat cary. i work for senator sam albert and i was given jerry's name.
BRILL: jerry's on vacation 'till monday. i can give him the message when he gets back. that was patrick and the last name--
PATRICK: the thing is...it really can't wait.
BRILL: my name's neil. maybe i can help you.

BRILL: oh yeah. got another one here. 
BRILL: nasty fella. a
BRILL: well, sir, i'm afraid it's not as simple as that. your average newspaper guy or hard copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
SENATOR ALBERT: well then who can?
BRILL: ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
SENATOR ALBERT: what do you mean? who can buy this kind of equipment.
BRILL: the thing is, senator, and i don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
SENATOR ALBERT: what are you saying?
BRILL: most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
SENATOR ALBERT: law enforcement?
BRILL: fbi, cia, nsa, local cops.
SENATOR ALBERT: are you sure about this?
BRILL: i yanked this off your rv. it's a global positioning tracker.
SENATOR ALBERT: oh my
BRILL: tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
SENATOR ALBERT: with what?
BRILL: with spy satellites. i don't like saying these things senator...
SENATOR ALBERT: neil, thank you for your help.
BRILL: anytime.
SENATOR ALBERT: this is sam albert. put me through to langley. marshal's office.

BRILL: albert's primed. we'll let him stew for a day and then drop the tape. 
DEAN: he came in four minutes ago.
BRILL: c'mon.

BRILL: feeling lucky? 
DEAN: not particularly, no.
DEAN: i'm stuck. help me out.

SHAFFER: he found an nsa sat tracker on his motor home today.
REYNOLDS: it's not ours.
MARSHAL: it was pulsing on your sat frequencies.
SHAFFER: i don't know what's going on, but if you people have tripped over your own again, you're not gonna get any help from us. it's ending at your doorstep.
HICKS: brill's dead.

REYNOLDS: what about-- 
HICKS: we don't know.
REYNOLDS: explain that.

HICKS: jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body. 
REYNOLDS: what about the tape?
HICKS: we think it was on brill. if it was, it's destroyed now.
REYNOLDS: and if it wasn't?
PRIEST: peace be with you.

PRIEST: the lord said: i leave you peace, my peace i leave you. let us now, in the spirit of these holidays, turn to our neighbors and offer them a sign of peace.

DEAN: that's gonna end tonight.

TECHNICIAN: got it!

HICKS: found him. kent island nailed the call five minutes ago. he's stationary. 
REYNOLDS: do you have visual?

DISPATCHER: nine-one-one emergency. 
OLD MAN'S VOICE: my name's jack kreuger, i'm at 1102 grambling. i just saw three guys break into the condo next door. it looked to me like they had guns.

DEAN: my name's robert dean.

ALBERT: i understand we have a problem. 
PATRICK: senator--
CHRISTA: senator, there were some things i couldn't tell you over the phone.
ALBERT: what kinds of things?
PATRICK: mr. dean has a video tape from the hotel room in boston.
ALBERT: i see.
DEAN: it's actually dh-1 digitech pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
ALBERT: i don't know what that means.
DEAN: me neither, but the upshot is i've got color live-action footage of you and ms hawkins and it doesn't look good.
ALBERT: so...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
DEAN: i don't want any money. and believe me, i have no interest in ruining your life. i'm not interested in this tape.
ALBERT: you're not.
PATRICK: then what do you want from the senator?
DEAN: i want him to look at a different tape. people have been killed.

REYNOLDS: yeah. 
TECHNICIAN: sir, we've just intercepted an fbi communication.
REYNOLDS: well...what is it?
TECHNICIAN: well, sir, it seems there's a warrant out on-- the doorbell rings. reynolds is alarmed.

FBI AGENT: you're under arrest. you have the right to remain silent. anything you say--
REYNOLDS WIFE: honey...?
SENATOR ALBERT: privacy and the right to privacy is an

ERIC: these guys are always making speeches. 
STACY: it's an important speech, eric.
SENATOR ALBERT: today we face a threat to that creed. certain individuals in our intelligence community believe they're entitled to examine lives in minute detail, and claim to do it in the name of the common good.
ERIC: if they're voting today, hasn't everyone pretty much made up their minds.
STACY: actually, this man appears to have changed his mind dramatically.
ERIC: why?
VOICE: he saw the light, my son.
ERIC: dad!
STACY: is it over?
DEAN: it's over.
ERIC: how long can you stay?
DEAN: i'm not goin' anywhere, eric. i live here.
STACY: get ready for school, you're gonna be late.
ERIC: is it okay to use the phone now?
DEAN: it's okay to use the phone.
ERIC: alright!
DEAN: no "900" numbers.
STACY: it's really over?
DEAN: albert's gonna get me my job back.
STACY: i'm sorry about rachel.
DEAN: yeah. i wish you could've met...
STACY: who?
