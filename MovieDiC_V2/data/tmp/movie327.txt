BRIAN: this is it. this is the where he'd take her whenever he had the urge to molest her. 
BRIAN: of course! nobody would have heard her cries over the noise of the machines.

DRIVER: this defroster never works... 
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL: ...mmm... feels good.
DRIVER: have a problem with your car?
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL: no. my problem's with men.
BRIAN: this is where she murdered her first victim. they found his body over in the corner, shot through the head.
BRIAN: they found her second victim over there.

PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL: okay if i smoke? 
DRIVER: ...sure.
PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL: my matches are all wet. you got a lighter?

BRIAN: she lured them here with the promise of sex. imagine the anger and hatred she must have felt returning to this place. did she use that to help her pull the trigger? carrie snaps another shot. flash!! the blinding flash 
CARRIE: shhhhhhhhh.

PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL: what's the matter? 
DRIVER: ...nothing.

FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE BLACKNESS: the distant echo of a woman's voice. 
KIM: are you dead or alive?

KIM: brian? 
BRIAN: dead.
KIM: obviously!

CARL: man or woman? 
BRIAN: man.
CLAUDIA: real or fictional.
BRIAN: real.
CARRIE: ted bundy.
CLAUDIA: what a guess!
CARL: doesn't count, she's disqualified.
CARRIE: why?
CARL: because you've been living with him, and his thesis for the last year and a half. he's probably been researching ted bundy all week.
PETER: carl, you are the world's worst loser!
CAROL: any word from that gallery?
CARRIE: not yet.
CAROL: nervous?
CARRIE: ...apprehensive. let's not forget these are the people who banned the mapplethorpe show. anyway, california's loaded with galleries.
CAROL: you mean 'ted bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
CARRIE: ...soon as he finishes his thesis.
CAROL: listen, eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
CARRIE: yeah, well brian's got 'til the end of the summer, then i'm outta here.
CAROL: i'm sorry, but i just can't see you veggin' out in la-la land.

OMITTED: sequence omitted from original script.

BRIAN: i'm talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer. someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed. 
ERIC: oh, here we go again. let's just lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses, amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods.
BRIAN: look, it's a fact, most of these people suffer from a severe chemical brain imbalance. that enough tequila?
ERIC: probably not...
PETER: yeah, until it's your mother's head they find in the refrigerator.
BRIAN: executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
CARRIE: thank
BRIAN: ha, ha.
ERIC: yeah, but it'd sure make you feel better, wouldn't it?
BRIAN: no, it wouldn't make me feel better.
PETER: ...looking for this?
CARRIE: if i have to listen to one more "tweed" talk about his dissertation, i'm going to throw up.
ERIC: label it anyway you want, the bottom line is these people are evil, plain and simple.
BRIAN: okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? well then let's start with adam and eve and the snake.
CARRIE: who do i have to blow to get out of here?
BRIAN: a... i gotta go.

EARLY: coffee and a bowl of chili, please. 
WAITRESS: ...be right there.

OLD MAN: the antichrist'll be a woman, in a man's body. seven heads and seven tails. 
EARLY: make that to go.

EARLY: ...size 6. 
EARLY: that's right ain't it, size 6?
EARLY: happy birthday adele.
ADELE: early, you are so sweet.
ADELE: i feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
EARLY: well dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.

BRIAN: tonight turned out to be pretty interesting. 
CARRIE: the party? she grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair.
BRIAN: the warehouse. i'm not that drunk.
CARRIE: it was definitely the high point of the evening.
BRIAN: just being there where it really happened. it was different... more visceral.
CARRIE: mmm... i love it when you talk like that.
OMITTED: carrie pushes brian back onto the bed.

ADELE: you thirsty lucy?

ADELE: he said, if he ain't got the rest of his money by the end of the month, he's gonna "kick us the... f-u-c-k outta here." early works his jaw, thinking.
EARLY: he said that, huh? cursed in front of you?
ADELE: you gonna talk to him?

CARRIE: i thought you wanted to be a writer.
BRIAN: ...i do.
CARRIE: then you can write anywhere. let's get out of here, while we still can.
BRIAN: carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
CARRIE: no we can't. we can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh let's just go to california now, right now, before it's too late.
BRIAN: ...just like that?
CARRIE: just like that. load up the lincoln... point it west... stop when we hit the ocean.
CARRIE: that's half the kick anyway. doing something you've never done before. experiencing something... different. something... unpredictable.
BRIAN: ...these are great.

EARLY: adele, who's car's that out... 
PAROLE OFFICER: she's not here.
EARLY: what are you doin' here? i ain't supposed to be at the parole office 'til tomorrow, two o'clock.
PAROLE OFFICER: social call.
PAROLE OFFICER: you're supposed to call me when you lose your job early. i stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
EARLY: wasn't my fault...
EARLY: ...it was dangerous there and they treated me like
PAROLE OFFICER: yeah... well you never have been 'treated right'... have you? your father was pickin' on you when he threw you out of the house for stealing the tires off his truck. the marines misunderstood you when they gave you that dishonorable discharge.
PAROLE OFFICER: ...the police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. and no doubt god'll be pickin' on you on judgement day...
EARLY: i ain't got nothing against it's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. what are you looking for?
PAROLE OFFICER: that girlfriend of yours ain't much for housekeeping, is she.
EARLY: i'm thinking about moving...
EARLY: maybe down to texas... probably get some work on them offshore oil rigs. hear the pay's good... hell, the weather's got to be better'n here.
PAROLE OFFICER: what are you talking about? you know you can't leave the state. what you can do is get a job.
PAROLE OFFICER: you be at this personnel office, friday, three o'clock sharp.
EARLY: what is it?
PAROLE OFFICER: ...janitor's job.
EARLY: oh man... come on, i don't want no janitor job.
PAROLE OFFICER: hey, i don't give two about what you want or don't want... i'm telling you to be there friday, three o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be here for dinner. you understand?

OMITTED: sequence omitted from original script.

BRIAN: hey. i didn't have the heart to wake you. 
CARRIE: thanks. what are you doing?
BRIAN: well, i sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and i started writing.
CARRIE: so how's it going?
BRIAN: ...i think it's the best stuff i've done.
BRIAN: ...and i think i know why.
CARRIE: why?
BRIAN: because i was there. and for a moment that night i understood how she came to pull the trigger.
CARRIE: this mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
BRIAN: look, the thesis. i think there's a book here. your photographs and my research, together.
CARRIE: a book on the warehouse murders?
BRIAN: a book on some of the most infamous murderers in america. i want to go to where they lived and where they killed and i want you to photograph it.
BRIAN: what i'm thinking is, we can drop down through tennessee, across arkansas and into texas, from there it's a straight shot into california. "we don't stop... until we hit the ocean."

CARRIE: it's about time, kessler! i'd just about given up on you. 
BRIAN: we don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
BRIAN: ...it's either the best idea i've had in a long time... or there's way too much msg in this stuff.

DIEBOLD: hold on a minute there boy! 
EARLY: 
DIEBOLD: goddamit, you're gonna settle up that rent here and now.
DIEBOLD: i've had it with your boy. i want my money.

NEW ANGLE - DIEBOLD: as soon as the grand prix is out of sight... 
DIEBOLD: that's it! you tell him... i want you both the out of here by sunday or i'm gonna call the police.

DIEBOLD: elvis! get the off him!

CAROL: you know, they say one of these days... 
BRIAN: ...the whole thing's going to slide into the ocean... yeah, i know.
CAROL: "looking for someone to take turns at the wheel and share expenses... on a week long cross country blue- highways tour of historic murder sites..." you gotta be kidding. who in their right mind would want to do that?
BRIAN: ...i would.
CAROL: like i said...
EARLY: where's the personnel office at?
RITA: first door on the left.
ADELE: early?
ADELE: early? you down there?
EARLY: what's up adele? dinner ready?
ADELE: almost.
ADELE: early...
ADELE: tell me more about california.
EARLY: well... for one thing... they think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
ADELE: i guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
EARLY: yeah, and in california you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... and i heard your first month's rent is free; state law. i figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
ADELE: what'll we do out there?
EARLY: well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of lucky lager and climb up on toppa' that famous hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
ADELE: you know... i read once... ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf those astronauts left behind.
EARLY: bull. that ain't right... government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
ADELE: don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
EARLY: i heard that.

BRIAN: real polite. kept calling me 'sir.' 
BRIAN: i like that.
CARRIE: i still think we should have met them first.
BRIAN: beggars can't be choosers. they were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
CARRIE: please we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week, don't let them be as boring as brian's friends. anything... but that.

BRIAN: oh, yeah... he had a real thick accent right outta "deliverance." "still? who said anything about a still? get ya up in them woods!" 
CARRIE: funny, very funny.
BRIAN: "aintry? this river don't go to aintry."

ADELE: we shouldn't be doin' this, early. you leavin' the state, ridin' around with strangers... besides, what kinda people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered. 
ADELE: what if they're dangerous?
EARLY: they ain't dangerous adele. they're writers.
ADELE: early grayce!
ADELE: did you settle things with mr. diebold?
EARLY: yeah i left him with the car... we're all squared up now.

EARLY: what's this? 
ADELE: early!
EARLY: what kind of a person would carry a cactus in her purse!
NEW ANGLE: the lincoln comes gliding into view.

CARRIE: you've got to be kidding me, they look like okies! 
CARRIE: jesus... they've probably got five bucks between them. turn around.
BRIAN: lighten up...

ADELE: geez, they look kinda weird. 
EARLY: you just smile, let me do all the talking.
ADELE: how many times you gonna tell me that?
EARLY: as many times as it takes.

BRIAN: hi i'm brian... early, and you must be adele. 
BRIAN: let me help you.

ADELE: hi, i'm adele. 
CARRIE: carrie.
ADELE: i like your hair.
CARRIE: ...pardon?
ADELE: ...i said, i like your hair.
CARRIE: ...thank you.

BRIAN: tight fit. 
EARLY: best kind.

BRIAN: uh, we can stop somewhere if you and adele haven't had time for breakfast, early. 
EARLY: well, it's like this, mr. kessler.
BRIAN: brian.
EARLY: well, it's like this, bri'. i don't eat much in the mornin', never have. maybe a beer once in a while; lucky lager's my favorite.
ADELE: it's because of what he read in a book once... that folks needin' breakfast is a myth, or whatever, put out by those cereal people.
CARRIE'S POV - IN VANITY MIRROR: early motions adele not to talk so much.

BRIAN: so what do you do early? 
EARLY: oh... i do some work up at the merrick mirror factory, or i used to...
ADELE: one night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... after he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
CARRIE: karma.
ADELE: what?
CARRIE: karma... you know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
ADELE: that french ain't it?

BRIAN: so adele, did early happen to mention the places we'll be stopping at? 
EARLY: yeah bri' i did.
ADELE: are you takin' the pictures?
CARRIE: ...yeah.
ADELE: is it hard to learn?
CARRIE: not really.
EARLY: you gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
BRIAN: that's a good idea. unfortunately most of them have been executed.
EARLY: ...too bad.

PAROLE OFFICER: what happened? 
POLICE OFFICER: who are you?
PAROLE OFFICER: his parole officer.
POLICE OFFICER: right, i talked to you on the phone. they say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
PAROLE OFFICER: could be.
POLICE OFFICER: where would we find him?
PAROLE OFFICER: if i know, crazy son of a said he was thinking of moving to texas.
POLICE OFFICER: without his car?
POLICE OFFICER: what about the owner of the house... ...this john diebold, any idea where he might be?
PAROLE OFFICER: no, but i can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
LABORER: christ!

PAROLE OFFICER: ...diebold? 
POLICE OFFICER: ...that'd be my guess.
PAROLE OFFICER: looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
POLICE OFFICER: well now i'd say that's the least of mr. diebold's problems.

ADELE: thank you. 
EARLY: all right, who gets the... ...water.
EARLY: here you go bri'. got a couple a bags of chips and some jerky, just holler if you want some.
EARLY: can't hurt.
BRIAN: how much do i owe you?
EARLY: forget it.
ADELE: guess i don't know the first thing about cameras.
CARRIE: well, the first thing... is you need film. preferably black and white.
ADELE: you wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
CARRIE: ...yeah, sure.
ADELE: i like things in color, pink, purple, and red. i dunno, black and white is kinda... boring.
CARRIE: you just aim and press the button.

ADELE: look, pigeon forge! 
ADELE'S POV: road sign to pigeon forge.

EARLY: shush, adele. 
ADELE: early, can we stop there... just for a little while.

BRIAN: the novaks are all gone but the fence that michael zaruba was hired to put up is still here. 
BRIAN: the novaks embraced the young drifter as one of their own.

ADELE: hey you two. 
ADELE: give me a smile now.
BRIAN: neighbors said he was a quiet young man, who was often seen pushing the children on the swing set.
BRIAN: sorry, early... could you step out the way, for a second?
BRIAN: the first one to die was the nine year old daughter...
BRIAN: hello.
BRIAN: ...my name's brian, what's yours?
BRIAN: ...could i speak to your parents?
GIRL: pa! there's more of them.

BRIAN: hi, my name is brian kessler. 
BRIAN: i'm a writer, i'm working on a book about famous murderers.

BRIAN: ...i mean, this was the novak house... with your permission i'd like to come in and photograph... 
FARMER: ghouls...

BRIAN: we could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes... 
CARRIE: hey, i got some great stuff... it's okay.
CARRIE: it's okay... okay?
BRIAN: ...that house is part of american history now, whether he likes it or not.
EARLY: forget about it bri'. i wouldn't be surprised if that karma thing don't come back and get him.

BRIAN: well we've come three hundred miles so far. not a bad day's haul. 
BRIAN: you got any family or friends in california, early?

BRIAN: no. 
ADELE: me neither. how 'bout you carrie?
CARRIE: no.

EARLY: thanks bri', i'll get the next one. think it's time we hit the sack. 
ADELE: sweet dreams.

CARRIE: feel sorry for him? obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
BRIAN: 
CARRIE: up yours.
BRIAN: i heard that.

EARLY: can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? a lumpy mattress, that crummy tv and a crapper. 
ADELE: early, sing me a song.
EARLY: which one.
OMITTED: early start sing with her... as the song ends.
ADELE: hey can we go to that chinese restaurant when we get to los angeles? you know, to see all them famous footprints?

BRIAN: ...and all i'm saying is i think we ought to try and get along with them. that's all. 
CARRIE: you try, i'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
BRIAN: carrie.
CARRIE: i don't want to talk about it.
CARRIE: pretty smooth how he stiffed us on dinner?
BRIAN: he didn't stiff us. he paid for the gas remember.
CARRIE: i'm telling you he's nearly broke and we're going to end up paying for those two.
BRIAN: you finished?
CARRIE: ...um, maybe... maybe not.
CARRIE: ...um... funky sock.
CARRIE: ...and what's with that hair? is that grease or motor oil or what?
CARRIE: ...you believe that tattoo? looks like he had another girls name there and carved it out.
CARRIE: ...and that body odor.

BRIAN: morning... 
EARLY: bri'.
CARRIE: where's adele?
EARLY: she wasn't feeling so good.
WAITRESS: breakfast?

CARRIE: 
BRIAN: take your time.

EARLY: this the book your writing? 
BRIAN: it's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
EARLY: this guy killed a mess of people.
BRIAN: who?
EARLY: henry lucas.
BRIAN: henry lee lucas. well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
EARLY: wonder what all them people done made him so mad? brian looks to early in his rear-view mirror.

EARLY: here bri' let me do that. 
EARLY: how did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
BRIAN: he almost always killed strangers. spent years moving on from one place to another. that made it real hard to track him down.
BENEATH THE LINCOLN: early's feet galloping.

CARRIE: you dropped this. 
ADELE: early grayce if this ain't your lucky day.

ADELE: i used to smoke before i met early. but he broke me of that. 
CARRIE: broke you?

ADELE: early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor. 
CARRIE: so you don't do any of those things.
ADELE: better not, or early'd whip me.
CARRIE: he whips you?

BRIAN: that bad? 
EARLY: ...then some.

ATTENDANT: comes to twenty eight dollars. 
CARRIE: talk to him.
EARLY: call it an even thirty.
EARLY: i'll drive bri'.
EARLY: adele, get in the back.

ADELE: ...hey you're good. thought you said you never played before? 
CARRIE: i haven't... i'm a fast learner.

EARLY: ...they never caught that black dolya killer, huh? 
BRIAN: dahlia, no.
EARLY: now why is that?
BRIAN: some people think it's because he never killed again. he just disappeared back into society.
EARLY: you don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
BRIAN: i always thought it was the work of a serial killer. anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. and again. until someone stopped him.
EARLY: that your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
BRIAN: yeah.
EARLY: you wanna hear mine?
BRIAN: sure.
EARLY: ain't you goin' to record it?
BRIAN: early grayce, june twenty third.

CARRIE: why didn't you go with them?
ADELE: i told you how early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
CARRIE: how'd you meet early?

CARRIE: you know i can fix that haircut for you, if you want? 
ADELE: you can?

EARLY: i wonder if there's any "doors" out here? 
EARLY: you know... "openings" to other dimensions. i read there are a lot of them out west, mostly in the desert. they say if you know what you're doing, you can travel anywhere in the universe in a matter of seconds. wouldn't that come in handy?
BRIAN: by the way, i'm not much of a pool player.
EARLY: it ain't hard to play pool. i can teach you everything ya need ta know.
BRIAN: yeah?
EARLY: yeah! i'll even spot ya a few points first game.
BRIAN: wait a minute. you're gonna hustle me?
EARLY: nah... how much money have you got?

ADELE: how do you get your cigarette to stay there like that. 
CARRIE: i'm cool.
ADELE: could i try that?

CARRIE: it's a portfolio of my work.
ADELE: your pictures. can i see 'em?

ADELE: you took this picture?
CARRIE: took 'em all.
CARRIE: that's me.
ADELE: no it is not!
CARRIE: hold still.
ADELE: sorry. boy i'll tell ya, if early found a picture of me like that i'd be black and blue for a week.
CARRIE: you shouldn't let him do that to you...
ADELE: do what?
CARRIE: adele... are you serious?
ADELE: you think early's bad to me, don't you?
CARRIE: yeah.
ADELE: well... you're wrong. i ain't saying early ain't never hit me... but he never hurt me.
ADELE: ...when i was fourteen years old three boys raped me in the back of a truck, and beat me so bad i was in bed for almost four months... ...i feel safe with early, most the time he treats me pretty good. and i know he wouldn't let nothin' like that ever happen to me again... carrie is speechless, adele looks in the mirror at her new haircut.
ADELE: hey, that ain't so bad now.

LARGE YOUNG CRACKER: when you gonna give me so o' that! 
WAITRESS: maybe when you grow up a little sonny.
BRIAN: these aren't lucky lager, i ordered lucky lager.
WAITRESS: sorry honey, 'ain't nothin lucky around here.

YOUNG CRACKER: what did you say to her city boy! 
BRIAN: nothing, i jus...
EARLY: you'd better hit him first bri', 'cos it's comin'.
YOUNG CRACKER: this yur' boyfriend?
BRIAN: what?
EARLY: hit him.
YOUNG CRACKER: hey asshole!
BRIAN: they don't stock it here early.
YOUNG CRACKER: why you
WAITRESS: sorry about that, he's always causing trouble.
WAITRESS: these are on the house.

CARRIE: what's early been in jail for?
ADELE: carryin' a gun.
CARRIE: ...anything else?
ADELE: an' resistin' arrest... at least that's what the police said.
CARRIE: jeez... adele!
ADELE: i'd better be goin'. it's late.
CARRIE: great.

EARLY: got to see a man about a mule. 
EARLY: gotta take a piss.
EARLY: any reebs left in the back seat?
EARLY: aaahhhhh...
BRIAN: last one. early stares at the last of the lucky lagers.
EARLY: ...well i probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
BRIAN: no, it's all yours. it's on me... for saving my back there.
EARLY: hey, that's what buddies are for, right...?
EARLY: you know those doors i was talking about? found two of them back in kentucky. i wasn't even looking for one the first time. me and the boys are just swingin' our sickles by the side of the road, and i turned around and there it was... this door with this bright blinding white light all around it... course i'm thinkin' i must be sunstroked or somethin'... so i close my eyes figurin' i'll count ten and it'll be gone right... so i'm countin'... ...1-2-3-4-5... an' i'm 'bout ta myself right... -6-7-8-9... 10. an' i open my eyes slow, spectin' it won't be there right...

BRIAN: what were you "swinging a sickle" for?
EARLY: for... 'bout three years.
OMITTED: sequence omitted from original script.

BRIAN: gotta see a man about a mule... what's wrong? 
CARRIE: the same thing that's been "wrong" the whole trip. your good buddy early.
BRIAN: who said he's my good buddy?
CARRIE: you sure been acting like you were... ...out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
BRIAN: hey come on, you two were drinking too... so what's the big deal.
CARRIE: yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. he beats her.
BRIAN: how do you know that?
CARRIE: she told me... ...but only when she "deserves" it. did you know he was in jail?

BRIAN: yeah, for stealing a car. aaahhhh. 
CARRIE: 
CARRIE: ...he told her it was for carrying a gun, but the truth could be murder for all we know.

BRIAN: stop being so melodramatic! if it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state. 
CARRIE: maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! geezus brian!
BRIAN: of course! the accent, the clothes, and those table manners!... he's got to be a mass murderer! what else could he be? he switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway, and begins to pull his jeans off. carrie climbs into bed.
BRIAN: you know, it wouldn't even surprise me if he turned out to be... a republican!
BRIAN: goddamnit!... my toe!
