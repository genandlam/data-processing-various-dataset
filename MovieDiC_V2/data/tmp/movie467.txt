KILLER: loves me. 
KILLER: but i don't think he's too fond of you...

UGLY AMERICAN: this is not football... 
UGLY AMERICAN: ...football is three hundred pound guys, they run way too fast, they got helmets made of kevlar they use to spear the quarterback into the next life.

A WOMAN'S VOICE: yes? 
DEIRDRE: can i help you?
SAM: no...
DEIRDRE: i'm here... no, it was nothing.

SAM: sorry i'm late... 
VINCENT: what makes you think we're here to meet you?
SAM: who else would you be?
VINCENT: perhaps the police?
SAM: i know cops -- and you're no cop.
VINCENT: cigarette?
SAM: no thanks.

SAM: he trusts you to lock up? 
VINCENT: let's just say he knows who i am.
LARRY: anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting for?
VINCENT: the question isn't what we're waiting for... it's who.
LARRY: and who the is that?
GREGOR: whoever hired us.
SAM: i got this gig through a contractor. and he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
SAM: so none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. for all we know, we're working for different people.
GREGOR: now that is an interesting proposition.
SWEDE: how so?
GREGOR: because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides. your orders might be different from mine.
LARRY: what're you talking about, man? i don't understand.
SWEDE: what a surprise...
LARRY: i got a surprise for you, blondie...
GREGOR: why don't both of you shut up?
LARRY and SWEDE: you!
SAM: knock it off!
SAM: the point remains: we could be working for different people. there's a chance for one of us... maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others. i don't know about you guys, but i like to know who i'm working for. it can help prevent a great deal of... ...unpleasantness.
LARRY: anybody tries to unpleasant me i'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
DEIRDRE: it's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
LARRY: who the are you?
DEIRDRE: the name is deirdre, and i'm running this show.
GREGOR: who are you? ira?
DEIRDRE: from here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done. you. what do you do and what should we call you?
GREGOR: these days they they call me gregor -- and i'm a tech. i do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs. deirdre turns to sam.
SAM: sam. i'm a weapons guy.
DEIRDRE: you were a soldier, were you?
SAM: once.
LARRY: i drive -- and my name is larry. larry from the states.
DEIRDRE: and who are you?
VINCENT: i'm vincent. and i coordinate.
SAM: coordinate what?
VINCENT: things. this is my country, you know.
DEIRDRE: coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me. are we in sync on this, vincent?
VINCENT: of course.
SWEDE: they call me swede.
LARRY: who's they?
SWEDE: everybody.
VINCENT: and what is it you do?
SWEDE: me? i kill.

SAM: you shoot alright. 
LARRY: gets the job done.
SAM: all in the stomach, though. your man might live.
LARRY: not for long.
SAM: long enough to shoot back.
LARRY: is that right?
SAM: it's been known to happen.
LARRY: yeah, well... my way works too.
SAM: my way is better.

DEIRDRE: is it alright? 
GREGOR: it's quite satifactory.
DEIRDRE: good, because it cost enough. there's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better use it.
GREGOR: i intend to. this phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
DEIRDRE: you sure about this?
GREGOR: i'd stake my reputation.
DEIRDRE: but would you stake your life, that's the question...
GREGOR: in this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
SWEDE: you should watch what you eat.
LARRY: who the died and appointed you food czar?
SWEDE: i'm just worried about your health, larry. you could stand to shed a few pounds.
LARRY: and you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you blonde
SWEDE: who you calling dickless?
VINCENT: let's go for a ride.
SAM: where to?
VINCENT: to see a man about a thing.
SAM: i can do that.

LEADER: who gave you permission to park here? 
SAM: what's he saying?
VINCENT: pretty much what you'd expect.
SAM: that's what i thought.
VINCENT: he says this is their block.
SAM: as in, they own it?
VINCENT: something like that...
SAM: and i suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
VINCENT: i didn't know that you spoke french.
SAM: i don't. but the language he's speaking is universal.
SAM: i guess we oughta give them something... cut back to: vincent and sam.
VINCENT: if you think we should.
SAM: oh man, i am sorry about that... let me give you a hand.
SAM: what'd you say to him?
VINCENT: i asked if we could give him anything else.

VINCENT: that was a nice move you did on our young friend. judo? 
SAM: jujitsu.
VINCENT: same thing, isn't it?
SAM: not at all. similar, but not the same.
VINCENT: what's the difference?
SAM: one's a lot more painful than the other.

VINCENT: help yourself. since when do you smoke? 
SAM: i have, i don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
VINCENT: a cigarette? as in one? one cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
SAM: i do.
VINCENT: christ, i smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and i tell myself i could be worse. it's just so pleasurable.
SAM: it has it's moments. course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
VINCENT: there is that.
SAM: so, vincent: why bring me along for the ride? job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening. a tough guy.
VINCENT: like larry or swede.
SAM: exactly. why not bring them?
VINCENT: let's just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited. of course, i might have brought gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
SAM: watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe stasi, maybe kgb. he's smart, gregor is.
VINCENT: so is the woman.
SAM: deirdre? smart, yeah, and seriously dangerous.
VINCENT: i wonder if she truly left the ira.
SAM: i've wondered that myself. none of this answers my question, though... why bring me?
VINCENT: i wanted to see who you were.
SAM: who am i?
VINCENT: you were once some kind of special forces. airborne ranger, maybe a navy seal. after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like el salvador or afghanistan, a real mercenary. only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war. there's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
SAM: that's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow. then along comes this job, paying so much money i couldn't afford not to take it. somebody's paying through the nose for this.
VINCENT: they certainly are. whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
SAM: whatever it is it must be priceless.

VINCENT: lovely, isn't it? 
SAM: they'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york, and it would still get up.
FRANCOIS: that's good right where you are, vincent.
VINCENT: do you have it?
FRANCOIS: not so fast. who's that?
VINCENT: he's company.
FRANCOIS: bad company...
VINCENT: what do you mean?
FRANCOIS: he's a cop, vincent, he's french and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the head right now!
SAM: what's going on?
VINCENT: i just wanted to see something.
SAM: see what?
FRANCOIS: he wanted to see how you reacted when i said that you were a cop.
SAM: you told him i was a cop?
FRANCOIS: he asked me to say it.
SAM: he asked you to?
VINCENT: i needed to know.
SAM: you need to know a lot of vincent.
FRANCOIS: are you ready?

VINCENT: here's yours. 
FRANCOIS: there's been a slight problem.
VINCENT: what's that?
FRANCOIS: if you say a word in english, vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you, and that's a price i'm not willing to pay.
VINCENT: i take it you still want the money...
FRANCOIS: of course.

VINCENT: where's my information? 
FRANCOIS: in here...
VINCENT: then you better find it in your heart to tell me, francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
SAM: now would be a good time to get the out of here.

SAM: you know, what you pulled back there, that was 
VINCENT: i needed to see if you were a cop. i'm a popular man with the police, sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together. and that's the guy you have to watch out for. i hate cops...
SAM: well i ain't a cop.
VINCENT: how did you know?
SAM: know what?
VINCENT: that there was a gun pointed at me.
SAM: i saw you look off when francois nodded his head. i figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
VINCENT: but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did?
SAM: because that's what i would have done...

VINCENT: you saved my life back there in the park. i know this doesn't begin to make it right between us... 
SAM: what i did back in the park i did because we're working together -- we're on the same team. this is business -- this is work. we did it together, we share the spoils, even split.
VINCENT: i owe you a heavy debt.
SAM: whatever you say.
DEIRDRE: what'd you do with the money?

VINCENT: we kept it... 
DEIRDRE: is that right?
SAM: hazard pay...
DEIRDRE: the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to war...
SAM: we weren't real thrilled about it either...

LARRY: so what's the deal? 
LARRY: what'd you guys do?

DEIRDRE: i feel as if i've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon. could you teach me to do that? 
SAM: i didn't think to see you again tonight. you were pretty pissed.
DEIRDRE: i still am.
SAM: is that right?
DEIRDRE: that's right.
SAM: part of me says i should just look at this as a perk. you know, a bonus. but then i remember you're you -- deirdre who used to belong to the ira -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
DEIRDRE: nobody's saying they don't.
SAM: and when i consider that, i have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
DEIRDRE: i probably do.

GREGOR: i would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the american. 
SWEDE: i hadn't thought about it. understand me, gregor -- i take no pleasure in killing. it doesn't bother me one bit, but i don't get off on it.
GREGOR: a means to an end, is that it?
SWEDE: that's it.
GREGOR: then i guess we're set.
SWEDE: there is one other thing...
GREGOR: what's that?
GREGOR: what are you doing?
SWEDE: don't cross me...
GREGOR: nobody's going to do that!
SWEDE: really?
GREGOR: i need you, swede, i can't do this without you!
SWEDE: i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
GREGOR: i do, i do...
SWEDE: just remember it, then.

SAM: no goodbye? 
DEIRDRE: look, sam, don't take it the wrong way when i tell you we won't be doing this again.
SAM: you don't have to explain yourself to me, deirdre.
DEIRDRE: i know i don't have to, sam, it's just that, for once, i want to. when i was a - patriot, it was a given i'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with. you know: any man who needed setting up. sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. sometimes so i could kill him myself. ira isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, sam. to most of the men i with i was always the girl. "send the girl to do it." "tell the girl to take care of it." "have the girl him." but i look at you and i get this feeling you take me for what i am: no more, no less.
SAM: you're a hired gun, deirdre -- just like me.
DEIRDRE: exactly. and last night i wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
DEIRDRE: i better be getting that.
SAM: duty calls?
DEIRDRE: just business.

DEIRDRE: now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? what's your job? 
GREGOR: i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target. i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice, relaying that information to you.
DEIRDRE: next.
LARRY: you call me with the target's route, i follow along until we've reached the attack point and then i run his squag off the road.
DEIRDRE: which leads us to...
SWEDE: i ride with fat-boy...
LARRY: eat and die slowly...
SWEDE: after we stop the target car i get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
LARRY: i blast the lead car into oblivion...
VINCENT: while sam and i take out the back two cars...
DEIRDRE: leaving...
SWEDE: ...leaving me to step in, drop the target in the back seat, and get the package...
DEIRDRE: while...
SWEDE: nobody's taking me anywhere...
DEIRDRE: and then...
LARRY: then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
DEIRDRE: and then...
VINCENT: and then sam, you and i clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
DEIRDRE: very good. now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.

LARRY: where is this broad? 
SWEDE: you should learn a little patience.
LARRY: is that right?
SWEDE: it's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
LARRY: not in mine.
DEIRDRE: hello gentlemen, are we ready?

THE TARGET: you! 
SWEDE: not today.
SWEDE: i don't particularly like killing, tubby, but i want you to know that this one i'm going to enjoy.
LARRY: i don't think so.
LARRY: we've been crossed...

SAM: it's a cocktail. mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future. 
LARRY: fine with me, we got work to do. i don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do. i don't know about the rest of you guys, but i'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass. i don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
DEIRDRE: of course.
VINCENT: finding this package is a thing easier said than done. we don't even know what it is. what did we steal?
DEIRDRE: i don't know.
VINCENT: when this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show. and i don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
DEIRDRE: well i don't!
VINCENT: and i don't believe you...
DEIRDRE: you go shoot me if you want, vincent, but you'll be dead before i hit the ground.
VINCENT: i don't want you dead, woman, i want the the truth!
SAM: both of you...
SAM: ...put your guns down and chill out.
SAM: like it or now, we're on the same side: we're here and the package isn't. you're not the boss any more, you're our partner. so tell us what you know, so we can figure a way out of this mess.
SAM: now, what did we steal?
DEIRDRE: i don't know... well i don't! it's a mystery to me just like it is to you. but i do know who we're working for. my people, and the russian mob.
LARRY: your people? who the is your people?
VINCENT: who do you think, larry? the ira.
DEIRDRE: and you believed me? but it wasn't my people who did it.
LARRY: how do we know that?
SAM: because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
DEIRDRE: exactly. gregor, he was the russian's man. it was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the russians who had the capital to finance it. gregor, he was their insurance, and i was ours. everybody else was supposed to be neutral. gregor must've got to swede...
LARRY: i never did trust that blonde
DEIRDRE: that's why you were riding with him.
VINCENT: the question still remains: what do we do now?
SAM: gregor's cell phone...
LARRY: what are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our
SAM: did he bring that with him?
DEIRDRE: i bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract. cost a nice penny, too, especially that phone: gregor had expensive tastes.
SAM: check this out. gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently. when he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had and gregor had everything. then the wall goes down. no more cold war. and gregor is out of a job. no apartment, no special stores with western food and video tapes. i would bet dollars against that gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up. and i wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...

GREGOR: it's a beautiful street, no? 
DAPPER GENT: do you have it?
GREGOR: always in a rush, you are. all these years i've known you, you could never wait for anything.
DAPPER GENT: this is important.
GREGOR: do you really think so?
DAPPER GENT: you know it is.
GREGOR: relax!
GREGOR: look over there.
GREGOR: do you see that one? the girl in the light blue dress?
DAPPER GENT: what are you doing, have you lost your mind?!?
DAPPER GENT: why did you do that?
GREGOR: to make a point. i don't know her, and i was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk. i don't particularly like you, so imagine what i'll do if you try anything...

GREGOR: it's under your seat. 
DAPPER GENT: what?
GREGOR: as my american friend larry would say: are you deaf? it's under your seat.
DAPPER GENT: i can't believe you'd do that, gregor. i thought i trained you better than that.
DAPPER GENT: i've never particularly liked you either, gregor.

PHONE VOICE: is it done? 
GREGOR: it's done.
PHONE VOICE: gregor, is that you?
GREGOR: much to your disappointment, no doubt.
PHONE VOICE: it was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
GREGOR: i'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!

PHONE VOICE: so what do we do? 
GREGOR: what i do is none of your concern. what you should do is wait for my next phone call. i'm going to find a place where i can tilt the field in my favor. when i'm ready, i'll call you and tell you what i want you to do.

SAM: what's going on? 
VINCENT: you weren't around when i woke up, i thought maybe something had happened. this has been one very up job, sam, and i'm not taking any more chances on anybody... including you...
SAM: i came up here to sneak a smoke.
VINCENT: you were smoking?
SAM: i hope you don't mind i took your pack.
VINCENT: please, help yourself. smoke as many you'd like.
SAM: i borrowed that, too...
VINCENT: of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
SAM: i have a feeling i'm about to start buying my own.

VINCENT: that was a bad bit of business, today. 
SAM: it was at that.
VINCENT: a lot of people died.
SAM: i've seen a lot of people die before.
VINCENT: i haven't. not like that. how do you get used to it?
SAM: you don't. you just learn to live with it.
VINCENT: i won't lie -- there have been times when i had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
SAM: we live in a singular world, my friend.
VINCENT: i never really thought i was part of the world you move in, sam, to tell you the truth. i'm a hood, a thief. big time in a small time king of way. to the local police i'm a prize, to the local hoods i'm a legend. but to a guy like you i'm just another two bit hired gun.
SAM: you might be a hired gun, vincent, but i got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
DEIRDRE: christ, i was starting to think that the two of you had thrown it in and walked away. there's someone on the phone downstairs asking for you, and my somewhat limited french leads me to believe that he might have something to tell us about gregor.

VINCENT: he's going north. 
SAM: he's going back.
VINCENT: not necessarily. he could go off road at any number of places. he might not even be in the country anymore.
SAM: it's paris. the route's too indirect for anything else. a guy like gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now. he's going to paris. now i just hope we can find him before he gets there.
DEIRDRE: if somebody else doesn't find him first.

DAD: opera? this is an opera festival? 
MOM: i told you that, henry.
DAD: i thought you meant phantom of the opera. you know, andrew lloyd weber, cats, that kind of thing.

LARRY: this...this is incredible. is the rest of europe like this? 
DEIRDRE: some places, not all. italy, for instance, they're serious about their food. but try britain, anywhere in the u.k., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg. food's not our thing, you see.
LARRY: what is?
DEIRDRE: best beer in the world known to man or
LARRY: best beer in the world? budweiser for me, thanks.
DEIRDRE: budweiser? you talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence? that's not beer! christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
LARRY: oh yeah? whatta you drink, then?
DEIRDRE: i drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: guinness.
VINCENT: i hate to interrupt a conversation of such cultural depth... cut away to reveal: vincent -
VINCENT: ...but we've got to get back on the road.
VINCENT: we've got him.
LARRY: i'm driving.

GREGOR: edvard, is that you? 
EDVARD: yes, gregor, they sent me.
GREGOR: i'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber. it's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
EDVARD: that was a mistake, trying to kill you. mikhi did it without consulting me, i'd have never allowed it.
GREGOR: i'm sure. but i'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
EDVARD: we'll double your price.
GREGOR: really? do you have the money with you?
EDVARD: do you have the material?
GREGOR: you first, edvard.
EDVARD: perhaps we could both go at the same time...
GREGOR: i think not. after you...
SAM: after you,
SAM: you might have been one mean technical spook, gregor, but you wouldn't have lasted a week in the field.
EDVARD: gregor, are you alright?
DEIRDRE: gregor's fine... cut away to reveal: deirdre - she's snuck up on the gunmen, weapon drawn.
DEIDRE: ...but i think you're in a bit of trouble.
VINCENT: don't even think it.

SAM: don't talk to me unless you tell me what i want to hear, understand?!? you have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive. i want the item, and if you don't give it to me, i'm gonna kill you. 
GREGOR: i don't have it with me...
SAM: 
GREGOR: i swear...
SAM: then where is it?
GREGOR: i sent it to myself in paris.
SAM: sent it where?
GREGOR: a post office box.
EDVARD: do you know who he is? he's with interpol, the internation police. he's a cop.

VINCENT: you're a cop...you're a cop...i should kill you. 
SAM: but you can't.

EDVARD: where do i know you from? 
VINCENT: vienna.
EDVARD: of course...i remember. i quite liked you, i'm sorry to have to do this.
SAM: hey...

VINCENT: that makes twice now you've saved my life. 
SAM: i didn't save your life back there. risked it, maybe -- but i didn't save
VINCENT: you see it your way, i'll see it mine.
SAM: you know one around here? somebody you trust?
VINCENT: no...i thought i'd take you to the hospital.
SAM: no hospitals. i'll fix this myself if i have to.
VINCENT: fix it yourself? why are we even doing this? there's no need to run, you're a cop.
SAM: not exactly.
VINCENT: you're with interpol -- you're a cop.
SAM: if i was a cop, a real cop, i'd have busted you a long time ago. this isn't about you, it's about the job i have to do.
VINCENT: and what job is that?
SAM: my job, vincent, a job you don't need to know about. i can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point. it's me or nobody, and i've been on this job too long not to finish.
VINCENT: it looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
SAM: we? there is no we in my world now, vincent, just me.
VINCENT: i'm going with you.
SAM: this doesn't involve you, don't you understand? i can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
VINCENT: it isn't about money for me, not anymore.
SAM: you don't have to do this.
VINCENT: yes i do.

DEIRDRE: when we're done with this, i want to do for that one myself. 
SEAMUS: now there's the deirdre i know.
DEIRDRE: and what's that supposed to mean, seamus reilly?
SEAMUS: it means i was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you. you've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, i might note. there's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
DEIRDRE: so you thought that maybe i'd grown too attached to this charade i've been playing, is that it?
SEAMUS: it's been known to happen.
DEIRDRE: not to me, you know that.
SEAMUS: i thought i did.
DEIRDRE: i guess you don't know me, then, if you think i won't kill you for an insult like that!
SEAMUS: just testing, lass. forgive me, but i had to do it.
DEIRDRE: remember what we agreed on, seamus: when we get home, i don't play "the girl" again.

VINCENT: hello, jean-pierre. 
JEAN-PIERRE: hello, my friend. he doesn't look french to me, vincent.
SAM: american.
JEAN-PIERRE: well, vincent's american friend, shall we see what we can do for you?

JEAN-PIERRE: are you sure you won't have a drink? 
SAM: douse the wound with alcohol.
SAM: take the clamp...
SAM: peel back the skin and attach the clamp.
VINCENT: alright, it's done.
SAM: you see the bullet?
VINCENT: clearly.
SAM: good. now take the forceps, and
VINCENT: a souvenir...
SAM: you think you can stitch me up on you own?
JEAN-PIERRE: don't worry, we'll take care of it.
SAM: then if you don't mind... i'm gonna pass out.

JEAN-PIERRE: he's tough, your american friend. 
VINCENT: yes, sam's tough alright.
JEAN-PIERRE: and you respect him.
VINCENT: of course. don't you?
JEAN-PIERRE: i've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through. he's a cop?
VINCENT: not exactly.
JEAN-PIERRE: not exactly? but close enough, eh? so he saved your life, then?
VINCENT: how did you know?
JEAN-PIERRE: if he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.

JEAN-PIERRE: you're feeling better? 
SAM: some, thanks. enough to move on, for now.
JEAN-PIERRE: you should really let a doctor look at that.
SAM: soon.
JEAN-PIERRE: but first you have something to take care of?
SAM: yeah.
JEAN-PIERRE: something important? a thing that cannot wait?
SAM: it gets done now or not at all. another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where i can't get them.
JEAN-PIERRE: forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but i am the one who connected vincent to this job, his agent, if you will. he is one of my oldest friends and i owe him a great debt, much like the debt i suspect he owes you.

SAM: vincent doesn't owe me a thing. 
JEAN-PIERRE: he sees this differently, as you well know.
SAM: i didn't expect that he would.

JEAN-PIERRE: you suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law. 
SAM: vincent told you that i'm a cop?
JEAN-PIERRE: not a word. but no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do. and so i place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me. you work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
SAM: so this is what, a test?
JEAN-PIERRE: call it a reckoning of character.
SAM: if i was healthy, i could take that away from you.
JEAN-PIERRE: perhaps. but you are not healthy, and if you try i'll kill you.
SAM: so what is it you want to know?
JEAN-PIERRE: i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created.
SAM: created?
JEAN-PIERRE: perhaps forged is a better word. like steel. like a sword. you're a modern samurai. i've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like vincent. but i've never seen anyone like you. i'm afraid vincent will die if he goes with you.
SAM: vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself. and i'm not any kind of samurai.
JEAN-PIERRE: you seem one to me.
SAM: a samurai has honor, a samurai live by the code of bushido, the way of the warrior. i'm just a killer for hire. the world isn't about honor, anymore. it's about survival.
JEAN-PIERRE: survival. i suppose that's as good a cause as any.

DEIRDRE: where's the case? 
GREGOR: there's a problem...
SEAMUS: problem my ass! i think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
DEIRDRE: would somebody tell me what well happened in there?
SEAMUS: nothing.
SEAMUS: if you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, i'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
SEAMUS: ease up, man...i'm just checking to make sure you're on the level.
SEAMUS: and it seems to me i saw a sign in there that says they got a late afternoon delivery. why don't we come back later today and do this all over again, huh? seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit

TONY: hey, man, they're both great movies. one is more of a character study, the other is more of a straight action thing, but they're great movies, and he's an amazing filmmaker. 
TONY: excuse me...
TONY: my man, how you doing?
VINCENT: i'm alright. and you?
TONY: doing well. this is?
VINCENT: a friend. i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
TONY: why don't we step into my office...
TONY: so what can i do for you?
VINCENT: i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
TONY: matter of face there's this flick i've been hearing about. i haven't seen it, but from what i hear it's pretty cool.
SAM: what's the story?
TONY: it's an international thing. several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job. but maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the russian mob and the ira in bed together.
VINCENT: do you have the tape?
TONY: i might know where you could get a copy.
TONY: let me do some business with my boy here, and i'll meet you across the street in five. i gotta make homes here feel like he's getting a good deal while i give him the pleasure of overpaying me for a couple of second generation pirates.

TONY: what i've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk. i wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like i said, the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix. 
VINCENT: you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
TONY: all depends on whether you want the russian or the gaelic language version.
SAM: gaelic.
TONY: you sure?
SAM: i'm sure.
VINCENT: can you get it?
TONY: the russian would be easier.
SAM: why's that?
TONY: cause the russian production company would be easier to find.
SAM: it's the irish tape we want.
TONY: gonna be tough. tony scribbles something on a piece of paper.
TONY: last i heard there was a film rep for the irish players staying at this address, name of seamus reilly.
SAM: seamus reilly.
VINCENT: you know him?
SAM: i know of him.
TONY: seamus reilly, boy's a serious irish auteur -- a real firebrand. thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what i'm saying.
VINCENT: i get the picture.
VINCENT: tony and i have to talk some business, first.
TONY: i gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
VINCENT: it's a matter of respect.

SAM: the irish representative? 
VINCENT: yes.
SAM: what's this?
VINCENT: the address of the russian production company. just in case we need to find them.
SAM: thorough man.

SAM: you sure your friend got the right place? 
VINCENT: if tony says this is it, then it's it.
VINCENT: tell me, sam: why do you do this?
SAM: do what?
VINCENT: continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
SAM: it's my job.
VINCENT: then quit. you don't work for interpol, sam.
SAM: sure i do. you heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what edvard said.
VINCENT: it's a cover, then. a cover within a cover, a feint within a feint. you work for the cia, it's the only possible answer.
SAM: i'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed. i do dark ops.
VINCENT: dark ops?
SAM: dark operations. wet work. kidnaping.
VINCENT: very ugly.
SAM: it is at that.
VINCENT: not very zen of you, huh? not so much the modern samurai after all.
SAM: i never made that claim.
VINCENT: i know. jean-pierre did.
SAM: you were behind the door?
VINCENT: i was waiting to see what would happen. i didn't want to kill him if i didn't have to.
SAM: you would have done that?
VINCENT: i would have tried not to. but yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, i would have.
SAM: how could you have done that?
VINCENT: because i owe you. look at that...
SAM: all things come to those who wait.
VINCENT: he's not dead.
SAM: they don't have the package.
VINCENT: you think?
SAM: you said it yourself: gregor's not dead. if they had the package, they'd have killed him.
VINCENT and SAM: they're going to get it.

SAM: don't do it... 
DEIRDRE: well, if it isn't mr. interpol himself. i can't believe i misjudged you like i did.
SAM: oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
DEIRDRE: i'm a patriate.
SAM: don't even think that i'm buying that.
DEIRDRE: where do you get off saying word one? all the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, seamus and myself. and here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
SAM: i didn't say i was.
DEIRDRE: hell...
SAM: don't even think it.
SAM: i'd kill you before you had it halfway out.
SAM: put your seatbelt on.

VINCENT: what the happened? 
SAM: i don't know...
VINCENT: you don't know? bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.

SEAMUS: what in is going on? 
DEIRDRE: they're part of the team. one of them's the guy i told you about.
SEAMUS: from interpol?
DEIRDRE: that's him.

SEAMUS: how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us? 
DEIRDRE: i told you: they're good...

SEAMUS: this better be the real thing or you're a dead man! 
GREGOR: it is, i'm telling you it is!!
SEAMUS: you've told me a lot of things, boyo...
SEAMUS: lose them!
DEIRDRE: you lose them!
SEAMUS: to the right!!!
SAM: give me a cigarette.
VINCENT: right now?
SAM: gimme a cigarette!!!!
VINCENT: why are you driving?
SEAMUS: about time!
DEIRDRE: not yet...
SEAMUS: good christ! can't you lose these jokers?
DEIRDRE: they're good!

SAM: nice place. 
VINCENT: i'm not here very much.
SAM: business keeps you on the road?
VINCENT: something like that.
SAM: i know i don't need to say this to you, but i need to say it to you. this is my job, i have to do it.
VINCENT: so i do it.
SAM: no you don't, and you know it.
VINCENT: if our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
SAM: in a minute.
VINCENT: i think not.
VINCENT: do we need anything else?
SAM: yeah. we need out heads examined.

DEIRDRE: you better be careful, seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix. 
SEAMUS: plastic surgeon? you think i'm going to fix this, deirdre lass? it's the mark of the patriot, and i'll wear it like a badge. as for those who done it to me, i'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
DEIRDRE: you're thinking with your gun, seamus, and not your head...
SEAMUS: shut up!!! shut up and drive! i'm your superior officer and you will do as i well say, is that understood?!?
SEAMUS: do i need to repeat myself?
DEIRDRE: no, seamus. i heard you the first time.

SAM: not here. they might see it. 
VINCENT: if i'm going to die for the cia, i'm going to go out smoking. besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a thing.
SAM: time to quit.
VINCENT: just like that?
SAM: not just like that... just before i turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
VINCENT: what of it? samurai pain in the ass.
SAM: would you stop with that...
VINCENT: why? you've got more force of will than anyone i've ever seen. you handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia... and most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
SAM: the mark of a true samurai. what i do for the company, vincent, is no different than what you do. we're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
VINCENT: why then, sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other? surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
SAM: because i don't walk away.
VINCENT: why not?
SAM: it's the one thing i've got left to hold onto. jean-pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
VINCENT: closest and oldest.
SAM: and yet you would have killed him to save my life. you have a sense of honor, vincent, that i can't even remember anymore. i don't know that i ever even had it to begin with. all i know to do, vincent, is to finish my job.
VINCENT: and when you finish? what then? this package, whatever it is, do you give it to the cia? do you really think they deserve it?
SAM: that's a good question.
VINCENT: do you have a good answer?
SAM: no, i don't.

MIKHI: sit, sit... would you like one? 
GREGOR: no, mikhi, i wouldn't. since i won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, english will do nicely.
MIKHI: whatever you wish... this has all been a terrible mistake, gregor. i wanted to play straight with you, but edvard insisted we try and kill you.
GREGOR: edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
MIKHI: i'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
GREGOR: enough!
MIKHI: ahh...
SEAMUS: the moment of truth, is it?
GREGOR: what is he doing here?
SEAMUS: what am i doing here? why, i'm here to see my partners, gregor, the boys in the russian mafia. see, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross. but they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me. i can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
GREGOR: but you hate each other!
SEAMUS: what's a little hate between business partners?

GREGOR: so, you've got it all figured, do you? 
SEAMUS: figured enough to know there's an odd man out and i'm looking at him.
GREGOR: i think not. i have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens. unless, of course, i deactivate it before it goes off.
DEIRDRE: that figures...
GREGOR: should any of you decide to rush me, i'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
MIKHI: and more importantly --
GREGOR: i'll destroy whatever's in the case.
SEAMUS: it looks, gentlemen, as if we're gonna have to sit down to table and work out an agreement.

SAM: let's work our way through the building. i'll take one wing, you take the other. 
SAM: watch your back, vincent.

SAM: go on, them... 
DEIRDRE: let it go, sam, walk away.
DEIRDRE: it!

GREGOR: we'll die if we stay here! 
MIKHI: you'll die if you leave here.

VINCENT: you have to stop doing that! 
SAM: i'll work on it...

SEAMUS: turn around real slow, and try hard not to breathe when you do it. 
SEAMUS: it's you... you're the one did this to my face, are you?
SAM: that's me.
SEAMUS: have a nice afterlife.
DEIRDRE: seamus!
SEAMUS: deirdre, do for him, woman, put a bullet in his head! deirdre hesitates, uncertain.
SEAMUS: do it, for christ's sake, do it so we can find that stinking gregor, he's got the package! for sake, you're a soldier...
SEAMUS: you're one of us...you been born and bred with your own people, you can't go against your nature. c'mon, girl, i'm you're people.
DEIRDRE: i'm no girl, seamus...
DEIRDRE: and you ain't nobody's people.
SAM: let's get him out of here...
VINCENT: finish the job...
SAM: and now...
VINCENT: finish it!
DEIRDRE: sam...
VINCENT: i'm really sick of you saving my life. go out and get the bastard.
DEIRDRE: he's got the briefcase rigged to explode five seconds after anybody other than himself tries to open it.
SAM: deirdre, wait up --
GREGOR: you might have made a good field agent you arrogant american prick, but you're not smart enough to go up against me.
GREGOR: go ahead, shoot... shoot and kill the i don't care. and yet you don't shoot. interesting.
DEIRDRE: don't do it, sam!
GREGOR: shut up!
DEIRDRE: he'll kill me anway, sam, shoot though me and kill this
SEAMUS: if you don't, i will...

SAM: are you alright? 
DEIRDRE: alright? it's freezing in here!

DETECTIVE: i need to speak with that man. 
SAM: i'm sorry, i can't allow that.
SAM: call that number and ask them what you should do.

DOCTOR: you can see your friend, now. 
SAM: thank you very much.
DOCTOR: the field dressing you put on saved his life. where di you learn to do that?
SAM: here and there, i guess.

VINCENT: you 
SAM: what?
VINCENT: you speak french.
SAM: what of it?
VINCENT: nothing...
VINCENT: "your field dressing saved his life." that's three i owe you.
SAM: you don't owe me a thing, vincent, and you know it. you stepped in front of a bullet for me. i owe you a heavy debt.
VINCENT: i know.
SAM: you better get some sleep, alright?
VINCENT: tell me something first. the package: what was it?
SAM: i don't know. nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. there's probably a couple of guys back at the company who know, but i don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
VINCENT: what happened to it?

SAM: gone. destroyed. 
VINCENT: i guess that's for the best.
VINCENT: sam, when gregor had deirdre by the lake, you could have killed the two of them with one shot. you could have had the package, finished the job. but you didn't, you sacrificed the job to save her life. why?
SAM: it's what you would have done.

VINCENT: would you just smoke already... 
SAM: i told you, i quit.
VINCENT: just to keep me company, sam -- i hate smoking alone. how about you? i thought all you ira types smoked.
DEIRDRE: only the stupid ones. cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets. besides, i'm not ira no more.
VINCENT: so where do you go from here?
DEIRDRE: i don't know. i was thinking...maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
VINCENT: i'm up for that...
SAM: not me. you work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
DEIRDRE: come off it, sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
VINCENT: she's got a point. besides, i know of a job that's available.
SAM: how much does it pay?

PUNK: this is for seamus! 
VINCENT: let's go!!

VINCENT: doctor's orders... 
VINCENT: goodbye, sam...
