FRED: it's nice to know i can still make you laugh.
RENEE: i like to laugh, fred.
FRED: that's why i married you.
RENEE: wake me up when you get home.

FRED: what's that? 
RENEE: a videotape.
FRED: who's it from?
RENEE: i don't know... there's no return address on the envelope... in fact, there's no address on it.
FRED: does it say anything on the tape?
RENEE: no, nothing.
FRED: well, let's see what's on it.
FRED: come on.
RENEE: it must be from a real estate agent.
FRED: maybe.

FRED: good book, huh? 
RENEE: huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
FRED: same one you were reading the other night?
RENEE: what night?
FRED: when you didn't come to the club.
RENEE: oh. oh, yeah. no. this is a different one.
FRED: i called, you know.
RENEE: called? when?
FRED: from the club. you didn't answer.
RENEE: i must have fallen asleep. i was asleep when you got home, wasn't i?
FRED: you were asleep when i got home, yes.

FRED: i had a dream about you last night... 
RENEE: yeah?
FRED: you were in the house... calling my name... but i couldn't find you.

RENEE: fred? fred, where are you? 
FRED V.0.: then there you were... lying in bed... but it wasn't you... it looked like you... but it wasn't.

FRED: you're up early. 
RENEE: that dog woke me. i lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
FRED: who the owns that dog?
FRED: what's that? another tape?
RENEE: yes, i just found it on the step.

FRED: don't you want to watch it? 
RENEE: i guess so.
FRED: well, do you wanna watch it?
RENEE: yeah.
RENEE: we've got to call the police.
FRED: all right.

RENEE: ...yes, i've been on hold for ten minutes... i can't... all right, thanks. 
RENEE: hello, yes... good... my name is renee madison... my husband is fred madison, the jazz musician... we live at 442 hollis street... right... 442 hollis... near the observatory... someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... i know because they sent, dropped off a videotape... two videotapes... to show us... that's right... yes... it... the second one... shows us asleep... someone broke in and taped us while we slept!... isn't that enough?... okay, sure... we will... 442 hollis... yes, we'll be here.
FRED: so?
RENEE: two detectives are coming out.

FRED: that's it. 
ED: let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.

AL: very strange. 
RENEE: what is?
AL: the angle. the high angle shot on the tape.
ED: how'd the camera get so high like that?
AL: and smooth... almost no movement - back and forth, i mean.
ED: like you'd get if it was hand held.
AL: right ... this just glided along.

ED: this is the bedroom. 
AL: do you always sleep here?... in this room?... both of you?
FRED: this is our bedroom.
ED: there's no other bedroom?
FRED: no... there is, i mean, i use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
AL: you're a musician?
FRED: yes, i thought my wife ...
ED: what's your axe?
FRED: tenor... tenor saxophone. do you...
ED: tone deaf.
AL: do you own a video camera?
RENEE: no. fred hates them.
FRED: i like to remember things my own way.
AL: what do you mean by that?
FRED: how i remember them. not necessarily the way they happened.
ED: do you have an alarm system?
RENEE: yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it.
AL: why not?
FRED: it kept going off for some reason. false alarms.
ED: might be a good time to try using it again.
AL: anybody else have a key to the house.
RENEE: no.
AL: maid? relative?
RENEE: no, one of us is always here to let the maid in. nobody else has a key.
ED: let's check the doors and windows... see if there's been a break-in.

AL: we'll keep a watch on the house. 
ED: as best we can.
AL: if anything else happens, you'll call us. al hands fred a card. ed hands renee a card.
RENEE: we will.
FRED: thanks, guys.
ED: it's what we do.

RENEE: what the is going on?! 
FRED: i wish i knew.
RENEE: what was that?!!!
FRED: what?
RENEE: on the tape! there was something else on the tape.
RENEE: there! play it!

AL: you don't remember being awakened? it looks like you were aware of someone. 
ED: or something.
FRED: no, i don't remember anything. it looks like i... but... i don't remember.
RENEE: why would anyone do something like this?
AL: has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
ED: or not so recently?
FRED: no, not to me.
RENEE: i... no. no. no threats.
ED: we'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you?
AL: we'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
RENEE: i don't know if i want to stay here. i don't feel safe.
FRED: where would you feel safe?
RENEE: i don't know. maybe a hotel.
ED: did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
FRED: the first night ... not the last two.
AL: why not?
FRED: i forgot. anyway, i hate the idea of acting paranoid.
RENEE: acting paranoid?!!! someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! i thought you set the alarm!
FRED: i'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
RENEE: but that doesn't solve the problem. who is doing this? and why?
AL: we'll find out, mrs. madison.

MYSTERY MAN: we've met before, haven't we? 
FRED: i don't think so. where was it that you think we've met?
MYSTERY MAN: at your house. don't you remember?
FRED: no, no i don't. are you sure?
MYSTERY MAN: of course. in fact, i'm there right now.
FRED: what do you mean? you're where right now?
MYSTERY MAN: at your house.
FRED: that's absurd.
MYSTERY MAN: call me.
MYSTERY MAN: dial your number.
MYSTERY MAN: go ahead.

MYSTERY MAN: i told you i was here. 
FRED: how did you do that?
MYSTERY MAN: ask me.
FRED: how did you get into my house?

FRED: who are you?

MYSTERY MAN: give me my phone back. 
MYSTERY MAN: it's been a pleasure talking to you.
RENEE: i thought you were getting me a drink?
FRED: just a minute.

FRED: andy, who is that guy? 
ANDY: i don't know his name. he's a friend of laurent's, i think.
FRED: laurent?
ANDY: yes, i believe so.
FRED: but laurent is dead, isn't he?
ANDY: he is? i didn't think you knew how do you know he's dead?
FRED: i don't. i don't know him.
ANDY: can't be dead. who told you he was dead?
RENEE: honey, who?... who's dead?
FRED: let's go home.
RENEE: but...
FRED: now! we're leaving now! i didn't want to come here in the first place.

FRED: how'd you meet that asshole, andy, anyway? 
RENEE: it was a long time ago... i met him at this place called moke's... we... became friends... he told me about a job...
FRED: what job?
RENEE: i don't remember... anyway, andy's okay...
FRED: he's got some up friends.

FRED: i told you to stay in the car! 
RENEE: why? what is it? why did you make me wait out here?
FRED: i thought there might be somebody inside.
RENEE: was there?
FRED: no... of course not.

ED: stay put, killer! 
FRED: i didn't kill her! tell me i didn't kill her!

MARIAN: how could i miss it? the tv won't quit with that stuff.
RAQUEL: they're gonna cook him.
MARIAN: andy's from utah. he says there you have a choice... you can die by hanging or by firing squad.
RAQUEL: which would you choose?
MARIAN: andy would go for this, don't you think?... firing squad, definitely.
RAQUEL: do they aim for the head or for the heart?
MARIAN: the heart, i guess.
RAQUEL: i wouldn't... the brain would know what's going on. your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. savage pain, marian.
MARIAN: oh, that's hot... so you'd rather be hung, huh?
RAQUEL: absolutely... soon as your neck snaps, you black out. it might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it.
MARIAN: you might be right, raquel.
ANDY: guess who?

BILL: was he in a fight?
DR. ROGOFF: these conditions don't indicate a fight.
CLAIRE: but what is the cause then? ... and how did he get in that cell?
DR. ROGOFF: he can't talk. or won't.
BILL: that doesn't sound like pete.
DR. ROGOFF: your son has experienced some sort of trauma, i'm afraid. we were hoping that the two of you could help explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: you don't know fred madison?
BILL: no... only what was in the news.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: do you think pete knows him?
CLAIRE: i wouldn't know how.
WARDEN: you say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?

PETE: what?
VOICE: you heard me... we thought we'd come over and tell you about it. pete is getting pale with fear.
PETE: what's goin' on?
VOICE: great question!! in the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? it's been a pleasure talking to you. pete can hear the phone being passed again.
MR. EDDY: pete... i just wanted to jump on and tell you i'm really glad you're doin' okay.

ALICE: you got him.
