JACK: thanks.
FRANK: really. you sleeping?
JACK: only on odd days.
FRANK: seeing anyone in particular?
JACK: why the interest?
FRANK: because i'm your brother. because i care about you. because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that dog of yours. jack studies his brother's face.
JACK: i'm not seeing anyone. in particular.
FRANK: what about that waitress at the ambassador?
JACK: uh-uh. how about you? you seeing anyone?
FRANK: funny. strike a bell?
JACK: it's only a ring. not a collar.

FRANK: no, i mean it.
JACK: so do i.
FRANK: we gotta go, jack.
JACK: no, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. i won't feel guilty, so i don't gotta go.
FRANK: this time you gotta go.
JACK: i don't gotta go.
FRANK: you gotta go.
JACK: says who?
FRANK: your older brother.
JACK: you're thirteen months older than me, frank. that might've meant something in the apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
FRANK: christ, jack, it's her birthday.
FRANK: so what do you say?
FRANK: okay. and don't worry about a present.

FRANK: place looks good, huh? i got a neighbor boy to mow the lawn, pick up. five bucks. times've changed, huh? see the tree? remember the job cecil did on it the day dad planted it? you can still see the scars on the trunk. really. i was looking at it just the other day. i thought he was gonna kill that cat. frank smiles, recalling cecil's near-demise, then raps on the front door. jack studies the tree a moment, 
JACK: so what'd we get her?
FRANK: you'll see.

MRS. BAKER: well, if it isn't the fabulous baker boys! 
FRANK: how's the birthday girl?
MRS. BAKER: a little stiffer, but just as sturdy. mrs. baker hugs frank, then, a bit awkwardly, embraces jack.
MRS. BAKER: john. it's good to see you.
JACK: good to see you, ma.
FRANK: uh, ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. jack. he goes by jack.
MRS. BAKER: i thought maybe held gotten over that.
FRANK: twenty years, ma ...
MRS. BAKER: yes, yes. it's just that john is so much nicer. jack sounds so ... crude. when i was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named jack. i guess i just can't help making the association. jack's eyes slide over to frank as if to suggest he holds his brother personally responsible for this.
FRANK: uh ... yeah, well, you know, ma, john kennedy went by jack.
MRS. BAKER: catholics. what do you expect? oh, well, what's in a name, right?
FRANK: keep her busy, will ya? i have to set a few things up.
MRS.  BAKER: well, now, where's everyone run off to?
JACK: downstairs.
MRS. BAKER: oh.
MRS. BAKER: well, shall we cut that cake?
MRS. BAKER: so. how are you?
JACK: fine. you?
MRS. BAKER: oh, fine. silence.
MRS. BAKER: big piece or little?
JACK: huh? oh, no.
MRS. BAKER: none?
JACK: i'm not much for sweets.
MRS. BAKER: how's that dog of yours? what was his name?
JACK: eddie.
MRS. BAKER: yes. right. eddie. how is he?
JACK: he's losing his teeth.
MRS. BAKER: sounds like your brothers back with us.

MRS. BAKER: what's all this? 
FRANK: go on.
MRS.  BAKER: why, what's this?
MRS. BAKER: oh my ...
FRANK: recognize these two characters?
MRS. BAKER: i thought these were lost. where did you find ...
FRANK: in the attic. behind some of dad's stuff. look, jack can hardly reach the pedals. as frank's laughter fills the dark room,
MRS. BAKER: oh no!
FRANK: i had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together. boy, old man henderson didn't
MRS. BAKER: oh, look at you two. so skinny.
FRANK: wait. watch. here comes dad.
MRS. BAKER: that man. as the film jumps again, jack glances at the photograph to his right. the images on the screen flicker softly off the glass of the picture frame.

JACK: i made her nervous. 
FRANK: what do you mean?
JACK: her hands. like that.
FRANK: nah. medication.
FRANK: couple years, now. keeps the beat steady. nothing serious.
FRANK: she was glad to see you.

NINA: morning. you want coffee? i made coffee. 
NINA: did you break a cup, jack?
JACK: eddie did. nina looks at eddie, sleeping on the couch, then brings jack his coffee with both hands.
NINA: i practiced the piano last night. two hours. i think i'm ready for 'jingle all the way.'
NINA: guess they're up.
JACK: sounds big. what's he do?
NINA: process server.
JACK: what happened to the donut king?
NINA: married.
NINA: no breakfast. maybe they had a fight.
NINA: well, gotta go. teach me later? jack nods. nina kisses him on the cheek and exits.
JACK: hey.

FRANK: uh, thank you. that concludes our show for this evening. jack and i only hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did. as the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys, a freckle-faced bellhop comes up. 
BELLHOP: mr. baker.

JIMMY: mr. simpson asked to see you.
FRANK: all right, tell him i'll be right there.
FRANK: tomorrow we close with the 'aquarius suite.'

FRANK: so you'll come out, right?
JACK: yeah, okay.

JACK: hey, kids. dad home? 
JACK: what d'ya say? wanna run and get him for me? still nothing. jack frowns, takes out a cigarette, and pats his pocket for a match.
JACK: 
JACK: hey, kid. take it easy. no use. the kid's a world-class screamer. frank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed, comes racing out of the house.
FRANK: cindy! what is it?
FRANK: jack.
JACK: your doorbell doesn't work.
FRANK: honey, it's only uncle jack. you remember uncle jack.
DONNA: what's the matter? jack?
FRANK: nothing's the matter. is it, sweetheart?
DONNA: i'll take her inside. you too, little frank. out of the pool.

FRANK: it's probably the excitement of seeing you again.

FRANK: well, look at this. 
DONNA: you bring trunks, jack?
JACK: trunks?
DONNA: swimming trunks.
JACK: oh. no. strictly dryland.
DONNA: too bad. you could use some sun.

JACK: a gust of wind killed him.
FRANK: yeah, and what put him up there?
JACK: hey, you weren't there. right?
FRANK: look, can we forget last night?
JACK: talk.
FRANK: i been thinking maybe we should make some changes. i been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
JACK: sure, why not.
FRANK: it's just an idea. i want your opinion.
JACK: it's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
FRANK: we agreed that if i took care of the business; i'd be entitled to the extra. isn't that what we agreed?
JACK: that's what we agreed.
FRANK: if you're unhappy with the arrangement --
JACK: i'm not unhappy.
FRANK: if you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, i'd be glad --
JACK: frank. it. okay?
FRANK: i've tried to do well by you, jack.
JACK: i'm grateful, frank. how much?
FRANK: i thought maybe twenty percent. look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. the big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. we have to stay competitive, jack.
FRANK: what's that?
JACK: you, frank. all these years you been telling me we're different. we got novelty, jack. no one can touch us.
FRANK: two pianos isn't enough anymore, jack.
JACK: it never was.

YOUNG WOMAN: moran. monica moran.
FRANK: all right, miss moran
MONICA: actually, that's my stage name.
FRANK: i'm sorry?
MONICA: moran. monica. the whole thing. it's my stage name. my real name's blanche.
FRANK: blanche.
MONICA: no romance, right? that's why i came up with monica. it's what i prefer.
FRANK: well, that's fine --
MONICA: but if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for blanche. if you ask for monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
FRANK: right.
MONICA: and if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. she's opposed to my career.
FRANK: uh-huh. well, miss moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
MONICA: candy man.' is that all right?
FRANK: it's one of jack's favorites. monica turns and, seeing jack at the piano, gives a little start.
MONICA: oops. i almost forgot you were there. here's the music.
FRANK: uh... he knows it.
MONICA: really? isn't that a coincidence.
JACK: small world.
FRANK: well, shall we?
MONICA: who can take a sunrise sprinkle it with dew toss it in the air and make a groovy lemon pie the candy man can the candy man can...,

FRANK: impersonally.
WOMAN: i don't believe it. i come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because i have gum on my lip and i'm a few minutes late.
FRANK: you're an hour and a half late.

SUSIE: i sing now?
FRANK: that's the premise.
SUSIE: i get along without you.' slowly, okay? jack nods and begins to play. frank slouches down in his chair, preparing to be tortured again.
SUSIE: i get along without you very well of course i do except when soft rains fall and drip from leaves, then i recall the thrill of being sheltered in your arms of course i do but i get along without you very well.' susie stops. frank just sits there. jack just sits there. she can sing.

SUSIE: don't leave a girl hanging. second rule of show business.
SUSIE: yeah, well, okay. 'bye, bakers.
JACK: what are you, crazy?
FRANK: i just thought we should talk about it. between ourselves.
JACK: what's there to talk about? she can sing. that puts her at the head of the class. that makes her the only one in the class.
FRANK: i don't know ... she had gum on her lip, for christ sake. i don't think she's right for the act.
JACK: you're getting cold feet about this.
FRANK: i was just thinking what ma would think.
JACK: ma? ma? was ma there the last time we played the ambassador? oh, that's right, she was on bass. how could i forget. frank frowns and looks down at his hands.
FRANK: okay, okay. i'll call the girl.

FRANK: ready?
SUSIE: what are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?

SUSIE: the problem is i can't hear myself sing with all this... ... music. you know what i'm saying?
SUSIE: i mean, back there it may be hard to notice, but up here i'm having a little trouble getting a word in. jack and frank just stare.
SUSIE: i mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
FRANK: no. we are not supposed to be backing you up.
SUSIE: what i mean is --
FRANK: we're a team. we work together.
SUSIE: so work with me, not against me. okay?
FRANK: i suppose we can bring it down a little.
JACK: i'll drop the eighths.

JACK: yeah.
FRANK: well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.

JACK: every year.
SUSIE: so why's he do it?

JACK: hey, eddie. have some respect, will ya?

FRANK: so. how was everyone's christmas? 
FRANK: uh, jack ... if you don't mind. jack stares at the back of frank's head, then puts the cigarette away. susie takes a peek in the donut bag and looks a little sick.
FRANK: by the way, if anyone gets bored, donna packed some travel games. they work wonders with the kids. frank reaches under the seat and hands susie a sack full of magnetic games, puzzles, and plastic cubes.
FRANK: you two could play checkers.
SUSIE: maybe we should just listen to the radio.
FRANK: sorry. it only plays static. susie looks at the radio, then at the games in her hands.
SUSIE: how long did you say it takes to get to this place?

FRANK: any more coffee? 
SUSIE: uh-uh. hey, what's this?
SUSIE: you play all these places?
FRANK: baker's unabridged.

FRANK: my brilliant little brother.

FRANK: will you listen to that ocean? 
FRANK: and how about this air? i'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
SUSIE: smells like fish.
FRANK: of course it smells like fish. we're on the ocean.

FRANK: you believe this? i'm telling you, we're getting away with murder. two shows a night and the rest of the time we live like kings. it's a crime. jack stares at the ocean, then at the two beds placed 
SUSIE: hey, we're connected.
FRANK: great.
SUSIE: great?
FRANK: yeah.
JACK: i thought we had separate rooms.
FRANK: we do. she's got hers, we've got ours. hey.

SUSIE: you're kidding me. 
FRANK: as charlie steinway is my witness.
SUSIE: peggy lee?
FRANK: tell her.
JACK: she was staying at the grand downtown ...
FRANK: it was april. april seventeenth.
JACK: we were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
FRANK: pearls. white gown. beautiful.
JACK: frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
FRANK: a few bars!
SUSIE: what'd she sing?
FRANK: people.' you think streisand, right? hot that night. chills.
SUSIE: wow. you ever see her again?
FRANK: no. we got a picture, though. one of the waitresses had a camera. we were just kids. that was something, wasn't it?
FRANK: hey, will you look at that?
SUSIE: they must've bought the same map we did.
FRANK: what do you say we send a bottle over?
SUSIE: i don't believe it. you're a romantic, frank.
JACK: he's drunk.
FRANK: not true. besides, jack's the romantic.
SUSIE: oh yeah?
FRANK: he's just afraid to show it.
JACK: have some more wine, frank.
FRANK: good idea. to peggy lee.
FRANK: i'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
JACK: okay.
FRANK: i figure that way we won't get confused.
JACK: right.
FRANK: unless you want the right.
JACK: no, you take the right.
FRANK: we might as well do the towels the same way.
JACK: okay.
FRANK: i just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
JACK: good idea.
FRANK: but if it doesn't work out, let me know. i'm,flexible.
JACK: right.
JACK: you leaving that on?
FRANK: yeah.
JACK: all night?
FRANK: yeah.
JACK: we're gonna be here a week?
FRANK: yeah.
JACK: so you're gonna leave it on.
FRANK: yeah. you mind?
JACK: why would i mind?
FRANK: i don't know. i mean, i always did it as a kid. i figured it was no big deal. is it? a big deal? jack just stares at frank.
FRANK: oh. well. you want me to turn it off?
FRANK: i'll turn it off.
JACK: forget it. it's no big deal.
FRANK: they're beauties, huh?
FRANK: what?

MR. DANIELS: good morning, gentlemen. i'm mr. daniels, 
FRANK: that'd be me, sir. frank baker. this is my brother jack.
MR. DANIELS: tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos. we were assured they were in tune.
FRANK: yes, well, they are.
MR. DANIELS: then i'm afraid i don't understand.
FRANK: they are in tune. but not with each other.
MR. DANIELS: is that important?
FRANK: uh, well ...
JACK: yes. it's important.
MR. DANIELS: tom, who're we dealing with on these?
TOM: a mr. reynolds, sir. but he's gone on vacation. i called this morning.
MR. DANIELS: well, gentlemen, i don't know what to say. not being a musician myself i find it difficult to grasp the magnitude of this. i don't suppose there's any way you could just ... accommodate.
JACK: accommodate? i don't think i know what you mean.
FRANK: i think what mr. daniels is trying to say, jack, is --
JACK: why don't we let mr. daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
MR. DANIELS: i assure you, mr. baker, no offense is intended. i simply mean, well, we're not a symphony, are we?
FRANK: jack ... jack ... you're acting like a kid.
JACK: no, that's your problem, frank. you get around one of these and you turn into a three-year-old.
FRANK: what's the matter with you? so the piano's a little out of tune. so what?
JACK: christ, can't you hear it?
FRANK: no! i never hear it! maybe. sometimes. i don't know.
JACK: doesn't it matter to you?
FRANK: what matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. so 'tie a yellow ribbon' sounds a little flat. so what? nobody's gonna hear it, jack. nobody. so why should you care?
JACK: because i can hear it.
FRANK: well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. understand, little brother?

SUSIE: hey, fellas. what's the word? 
SUSIE: what's with you two?
FRANK: jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
SUSIE: 0-kay.

FRANK: thank you, thank you. 
JACK: right. i love you, frank.
FRANK: what?
JACK: i love you. i just wanted to say it.
FRANK: uh, well, i love you, too, jack. so. susie. how 'bout it.
SUSIE: huh?
FRANK: got another song for us?
SUSIE: oh. yeah. i gotta bunch of them.
FRANK: well then ... shall we?
BACKSTAGE: frank corners jack as they exit the stage.
FRANK: what's the matter with you?
JACK: i'm sorry, frank. all that talk about family. i just got emotional.
FRANK: how dare you say you love me.
JACK: it won't happen again. scout's honor.
SUSIE: what's with you guys?
FRANK: someone needs to grow up. i won't take it, jack.
JACK: sure you will. jack pushes past frank and leaves. frank watches him go, then turns to leave himself.

SUSIE: oh, sorry. with the light always on, it's hard to tell. 
JACK: it's okay. last one.
SUSIE: can't sleep?
JACK: in and out.

JACK: yeah, well, i wish would go a little easy on the trumpets. 
SUSIE: how's egghead?
JACK: like a baby. you?
SUSIE: in and out.
SUSIE: if you want, i got a pack in the room.
JACK: no thanks. i never touch french cigarettes.

JACK: what the are you doing? 
FRANK: what's it look like i'm doing?
JACK: really.
FRANK: yes, really. i don't want you to be unhappy, jack. if you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune. jack smiles to himself and crosses the room.
JACK: how's it coming?
FRANK: fine.
JACK: how long you been at it?
JACK: they stopped serving two hours ago.
FRANK: two hours ago!
JACK: time flies, huh?
JACK: i could give you a hand. if you want.
FRANK: what do you make that? paruchi?
FRANK: you haven't seen susie, have you?
JACK: no. why?
FRANK: just wonder what she's up to.
JACK: she's a big girl.
FRANK: yeah, well, she's our girl now. i think we better keep an eye on her. there's trouble there. hey, listen to this. ethel and bert lane. married seventy-five years. you believe that?
JACK: what the are these?
FRANK: dedications. i came up with the idea on the road. see, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room. the guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. daniels went crazy for the idea. and that's not all. last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability. like he wants to line something up. i think he's got a hard-on for susie.
WOMAN: excuse me.
WOMAN: i'm sorry to interrupt, but when i saw you sitting here, i just had to come over. florence simmons.
FRANK: uh ... frank baker. this is my brother.
FLORENCE SIMMONS: oh, i know, i know. my husband and i saw you
FRANK: oh. well, thank you.
FLORENCE SIMMONS: no, i mean you.
JACK: afraid not.
FLORENCE SIMMONS: well, it's frightening. you could be his twin.
FRANK: funny, huh?
JACK: what?
FRANK: thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere. wonder if i saw him i'd think it was you?

FLORENCE SIMMONS: i just know my sister won't believe me. do you mind? 
FLORENCE SIMMONS: i really hate to impose. it's just that the resemblance is so extraordinary. i wonder if you could turn this way so your face isn't in the shadows. as jack turns, he glances over florence's swaying
FLORENCE SIMMONS: say cheese.
FLORENCE SIMMONS: gotcha. would you like a copy for yourself? the hotel develops.
JACK: no.

FRANK: thank you. you know, before we came out here 
FRANK: ethel, bert. get up here and show these kids how it's done. a path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make their way to the dance floor.

SUSIE: forget your tie, handsome ... 
FRANK: you want to tell me what the hell's going on?
SUSIE: huh?
FRANK: i just saw a man walk out of your room.
SUSIE: uh ...
FRANK: in case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here. so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
SUSIE: decency? hey listen, pal ...
FRANK: no. you listen. i had my doubts about you from the beginning
JACK: hey!
JACK: what're you trying to do? wake up the whole hotel?
FRANK: we were just having a little discussion about morality.
SUSIE: some discussion.
FRANK: i just saw a man walk out of your room!
JACK: you saw wrong.
FRANK: huh?
JACK: he's with the hotel. i called him.
FRANK: what are you talking about?
JACK: we had a leak in the bathroom.
FRANK: he was wearing a suit.
JACK: he had to come quickly. it was a big leak.
FRANK: how come i didn't hear anything?
JACK: you're a heavy sleeper, frank. you've always-been a heavy sleeper. unlike me.
FRANK: i guess i ... if i jumped to...
SUSIE: forget it. the three stand there awkwardly for a moment.
FRANK: well...
SUSIE: boy, he comes on like a hurricane in the morning, doesn't he?
SUSIE: yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
JACK: hey, business is business.
SUSIE: it wasn't business. it was pleasure.
JACK: just dinner and dance, right?

FRANK: all right, everyone. this is it. let's hear it. ten. nine ... 
FRANK/EVERYONE: eight. seven. six. five.

FRANK: ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear. happy new year, little brother. 
JACK: what're you doing down here?
FRANK: celebrating. join me?
JACK: the party's over.
FRANK: no, you're wrong. it's just beginning. come on, have a drink. show your big brother how it's done.
JACK: expensive hangover.
FRANK: a gift. courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, mr. daniels. we, dear brother, are a smash.
FRANK: the holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it? with the blue glass. jack looks up at the chandelier.
JACK: the royal.
FRANK: right. the royal. when's the last time we were there?
JACK: couple years.
FRANK: february?
JACK: april.
FRANK: right. it's incredible how you do that. remember things.
JACK: a useless talent.
FRANK: drove me crazy when we were kids. the way you never looked at the music. miss simpson would just play it and ...
JACK: they were simple songs.
FRANK: not for me. i still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? otherwise, i forget. i just forget. but you. you never forget. ever. so how come you couldn't remember ma's birthday?
JACK: i told you. it's a useless talent.
FRANK: the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
JACK: yeah.
FRANK: i always think of him on new year's.
JACK: you always threw up.

JACK: he was just having fun. 
FRANK: it was like you'd passed some test, you know?
JACK: it was just a can of beer, frank.
FRANK: yeah, but he told you things. he never told me anything. even though i was the oldest. it was always you two, running off, doing things together.
JACK: you could've come.
FRANK: i could've. but he didn't want me to.
JACK: you're making things up, frank.
FRANK: maybe so. you ever go back there? where it happened. jack stares at the angry sea, loud even through the thick glass.
JACK: no.

FRANK: want one? 
FRANK: ah well, the kids'll break a couple anyway. suddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the newlyweds are heard.
BUD: give me the keys.
HELEN: you're not going to drive.
BUD: give me the keys!
HELEN: you're not going to drive!
BUD: it's my car!
HELEN: it's our car!
BUD: give me the keys.
HELEN: no.
FRANK: i think i'll warm up the car.

FRANK: that takes care of this week. the tenth we got the sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the capri. 
JACK: the tenth's out.
FRANK: what?
JACK: i can't make the tenth.
FRANK: what do you mean?
JACK: i mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
FRANK: be reasonable, jack.
JACK: i play two hundred nights a year with you, frank. how much more reasonable you expect me to be? jack gets out of the car. frank shakes his head in exasperation, then looks to susie.
FRANK: how about you? got a bar mitzvah this weekend?
SUSIE: huh?
FRANK: forget it.

SUSIE: i can't sing it anymore. 
FRANK: what?
SUSIE: that song. i can't sing it anymore.
FRANK: what're you talking about? they love it.
SUSIE: i'm gonna throw up, frank. i mean it. let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
FRANK: susie. it's one more show. one more time. that's all.
SUSIE: and two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night. frank, i can't sing that song anymore! she's yelling. the kitchen workers are glancing over. jack studies her as she tries to calm herself.
SUSIE: i need some air.

JACK: you're gonna wear down those heels if you don't give it a rest. 
JACK: relax. we'll drop the song.
SUSIE: guess i got a little scattered.
JACK: it's a song.
SUSIE: how do you do it? every night?
JACK: practice. there are worse songs, you know. not many, but a few. susie nods. jack studies her. something's on her mind.
SUSIE: listen... nothing.

SUSIE: you were good. 
JACK: i can keep the beat.
SUSIE: better than that.
SUSIE: what's the matter?
JACK: nothing.
SUSIE: what'd i say?
JACK: nothing.
SUSIE: you're upset.
JACK: i'm not upset.
SUSIE: all i said was you were good.
JACK: look. you don't know good. all right?
SUSIE: what's that supposed to mean?
JACK: it means you wouldn't know good if it came up and you.
SUSIE: you were good.
JACK: let's make a deal. you shut up.
SUSIE: you were good.
JACK: how do you know?
SUSIE: because i saw the other people! and they knew you were good! you were good, goddamnit! jack studies susie, then glances off. for a moment, they just stand on the corner, not talking.
SUSIE: so you wanna get a drink?

JACK: nina? 
SUSIE: who's nina?
JACK: friend.
SUSIE: friend? what's she look like?
JACK: she's four feet tall. ed?
SUSIE: ed? how many people live here?
JACK: i have to make him some chili.
SUSIE: sure.

JACK: how come you didn't close your eyes? 
SUSIE: i don't know. i guess i didn't trust the night like she did.
SUSIE: let me have a cigarette, will you? all of mine are down there on the sidewalk.
SUSIE: long story.
SUSIE: you know, i saw you guys once.
JACK: must've been a cheap date.
SUSIE: soap convention.
JACK: soap?
SUSIE: yeah, they got a convention for everything. at least he was clean. boy, the guys i met when i was with the service, you wouldn't believe. the older ones, they were okay. nice. polite. pulled the chair out for you. but the younger ones ... mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again. she thought she had it all figured out. but she wasn't so smart. there are killers with palms like a baby.
SUSIE: so what's this?
JACK: history.
SUSIE: huh?
JACK: my father proposed to my mother in there.
SUSIE: no kidding?
SUSIE: the both of them? in there?
JACK: he called her.
SUSIE: oh. so what's it doing here?
JACK: long story.
SUSIE: you sending me home?
JACK: they'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in brookhaven. usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't. anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
SUSIE: nervous?
JACK: by the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
SUSIE: you're kidding.
JACK: he had a mind that escalated things.
SUSIE: so, what happened?
JACK: he calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb. susie blinks.
SUSIE: wow. but i still don't see how ...
JACK: ma didn't want it around. after.
SUSIE: oh.
SUSIE: frank said you saw him die.
SUSIE: frank said ---
JACK: frank wasn't 'there.
JACK: he took me out to the docks one day. we did that a lot. there were other places, but he loved the ocean. he'd worked boats as a kid. never got rid of it. it was always in him. he'd drink a little when we'd go. if he drank enough, he'd do this funny irish jig. to make me laugh. he drank a lot that day. susie studies jack as he stares into his glass.
JACK: you got pretty eyes, you know that.

JACK: you gotta move 'em around if you want to play a song. susie starts, looks at her hand on the piano, pulls it away. 
SUSIE: oh. hi. sorry.
JACK: coffee?
SUSIE: yeah... no.
JACK: look, if you want to leave...
SUSIE: yeah, maybe ... no. i hate these cigarettes! susie throws the cigarette out the window, then looks down.
SUSIE: i think i started a fire.
JACK: if our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
JACK: why don't you go. i'll see you tomorrow night at the ambassador.
SUSIE: i followed you last night. i mean, i was here. outside. i was about to come up when you came out.
SUSIE: you can always get another girl.
JACK: there's always another girl.

NICK: sick? how sick? 
FRANK: the flu.
NICK: so she's got a few sniffles.
FRANK: doctor's orders.
NICK: you got no right springing this on me, frankie. it's unethical.

NICK: what am i gonna do? put a record player out there? bad, frankie. bad. 
JACK: what're you doing?
FRANK: just until we find another girl.
JACK: cancel, frank.
FRANK: you want to know how much i got tied up in deposits with willie? we're in for three weeks solid, jack.
JACK: better give her pneumonia.

GIRL: remember me? 
GIRL: monica. monica moran. i came in the last time you guys were looking for a singer. perseverance. first rule of show business. jack and frank just stare at her.
MONICA: i bought a book. that's what it says.
FRANK: we got the roosevelt on thursday, the park in a couple of weeks. larry shelton said he'd let me know by friday on the ambassador. that's it. frank folds the paper carefully.
FRANK: i got some calls out. things that might be good for us. frank looks over at jack for the first time. he's leaning against the building, staring at his shoes.
FRANK: we'll try for a girl again next week.
FRANK: okay. well, the roosevelt then.

FRANK: you know, my brother and i have been playing together, gosh, i don't know. jack? 
JACK: twenty-eight years.
FRANK: of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little different. we were just kids. just about the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, cecil. we must've shaved three lives off old cecil, huh, jack? frank laughs and his voice, eerily magnified by the microphone, is the only sound in the room.
FRANK: a very special place for jack and i. and tonight we'd like to open with a very special song. it's the song my mother and father danced to the night they were married. this is for them.
FRANK: you should've told us you were coming, ma. we would've come and got you.
MRS.  BAKER: spur of the moment.
FRANK: so what'd you think?
MRS.  BAKER: thrilling. both of you.
FRANK: the audience was a little off tonight.
MRS.  BAKER: a few empty tables. it's cozier. besides, mel torme couldn't fill this place on a wednesday night.
FRANK: i guess you're,right. well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? theo's should still be open.
MRS.  BAKER: no, no. you boys are tired.
FRANK: no, we're not. jack?
JACK: no.
MRS.  BAKER: i'm tired. really. i should get home.
FRANK: you sure?
MRS.  BAKER: just call me a cab.
FRANK: a cab? ma, come on. my car's just a half block down. you wait here.
MRS.  BAKER: all right.
JACK: yeah.
MRS.  BAKER: this was quite,a place once. after the war. on friday nights they had dances in the ballroom upstairs. it was beautiful. crystal chandeliers. white tablecloths. orchids floating in the punch bowls... it was a wonderful place to be young.
MRS.  BAKER: it went well tonight.
JACK: frank works hard.
MRS.  BAKER: and you don't?
JACK: he leads, i follow.
MRS.  BAKER: is that the way it is?
JACK: pretty much.
MRS.  BAKER: he mentioned you had a girl for a while. a singer.
JACK: for a while. she left.
MRS.  BAKER: yes, well, it's probably best.
JACK: i suppose.
MRS.  BAKER: funny. watching tonight, i was remembering when you were young.
MRS.  BAKER: you miss him, don't you?
JACK: it's been a long time, ma.
MRS.  BAKER: yes.
MRS.  BAKER: you look so like him.
FRANK: your limo's ready, ma.
MRS.  BAKER: all right.
MRS.  BAKER: good night, jack.

JACK: we're not getting paid then. 
FRANK: no.
JACK: nothing. we get nothing.
FRANK: i told you, jack. it's a telethon.
JACK: what's it for?
FRANK: i don't know. some disease.
JACK: what disease?
FRANK: i don't know.
JACK: you don't know?
FRANK: it's a disease, jack. we're against it.
JACK: what channels it on?
FRANK: seventy-one
JACK: seventy-one? what's seventy-one?
FRANK: a channel.
JACK: right.
FRANK: the guy said to find studio e and turn right. what's that say?
YOUTH: fast break!
FRANK: i guess it's that way.

FRANK: this must be it. i'll see when we're on. 
EARL: you the magician?
JACK: no.
EARL: oh. what do you do?
JACK: piano.
EARL: two at a time?
JACK: my brother and i. one each.
EARL: oh.
JACK: what's wrong with the kid?
EARL: knee. tore it up against st. anthony's. right before the accident.
JACK: accident?
EARL: the fire. the way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym. as jack registers this, earl's phone rings. frank returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.
FRANK: we're on after meadowlark. what's wrong?
JACK: are you kidding me? are you kidding me?
FRANK: what?
JACK: we're playing for a gymnasium!
FRANK: what?
VINCE: let's hear it for our own jimmy marshall, shall we?
FRANK: jack ...

JACK: you're a creep, you know that. i oughta kick your ass.
FRANK: jack, you're on television.
JACK: shut up, frank.
EARL: what do you say we go for a walk, pal.
JACK: get your hand off me.
EARL: come on, friend. i can smell it on you. get yourself a cup of coffee. you'll forget what you're angry about.
JACK: go yourself.
EARL: you're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, ace?
JACK: i don't see any ladies here. except maybe you.
FRANK: hey, leave him alone.

JACK: you're a lousy dancer, earl. don't you know the man's supposed to lead? earl shoves jack into the hallway, hard. jack stumbles back against the wall. 
EARL: who do you think you are, asshole?

FRANK: jack. we just,passed the car. jack. this is a tuxedo. three hundred dollars. you gonna talk to me? or is this jack's famous silent act? look, it was for publicity. do you understand? publicity. jack stops and stares at frank incredulously. 
JACK: what-are you? a moron? it's three o'clock in the morning, frank. who's watching? your wife? maybe you can get us a gig playing little frank's birthday party.
FRANK: look. i didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday. what was i supposed to do? i had the pianos anyway.
JACK: basketballs, frank. you had us playing for basketballs.
FRANK: i'm sorry. i should've checked it out. i screwed up. but that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
JACK: what?
FRANK: it wasn't professional, jack. it was a stunt. a stupid-ass stunt.
JACK: what's happening to you, frank? you been kissing so long you're starting to like it? you let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. we were always small time, but we were never clowns, frank. what's happened to your dignity?
FRANK: dignity? who the are you to talk about dignity?
FRANK: this where you get your dignity, jack? this is where you get your courage?
FRANK: no, let's do it straight for once, shall we?

JACK: stay off it. 
FRANK: no, let's stay on it. i'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda for christ sake, jack, he died doing a stupid jig. he left a wife and two sons. he wasn't a hero. he was a fool.
JACK: you weren't there.
FRANK: that's right. i wasn't there. i don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
JACK: you.
FRANK: no, you. and him too. the both-of you.
FRANK: hey, what're you doing? hey! jack flings frank against the wall, pounding, pulling and slamming him in a fitful rage.
FRANK: jack! ... jack! ...
JACK: how's it feel to have your little brother beat the out of you? huh? huh!
FRANK: my hands! my hands!
FRANK: jack!
JACK: who's weak now, big brother?
FRANK: jack! jack!
JACK: i'm through with it. i can't do it anymore.

CINDY: hello? 
CINDY: hello ... hellooooo ... daddy. daddy! someone's on the phone and they won't talk.

MAN: if they wanna talk about their wife, you listen. if they wanna talk about their job, you listen. if they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen. that's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until i send you home. okay? jack nods and points to the piano in the corner. 
JACK: that it?
MAN: how many you need?
JACK: it's out of tune.
MAN: trust me, the way i fix a martini, it'll be in tune.

SUSIE: i thought the bakers didn't take tips.

FRANK: hit the c. go ahead.
FRANK: i'm right, aren't i? they're in tune.
JACK: i'll take the mallory.
