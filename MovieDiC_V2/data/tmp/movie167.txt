O.S. VOICE: you know, when you fire somebody you have to stick to your guns. 
BENNY: and i didn't tell dupree that i'd give you your job back... all i said was that i'd be glad to talk to you if you said the right thing... do you have something to say? a stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously.
MAN: mr. giacomo, when one of the white guys has come off a double shift and says he's too tired to work overtime, you don't fire him.
BENNY: fella, what'd i tell ya? if you're not willing to give a little extra, champion can't use you.

BENNY: now... do... you... have... something... to say? 
EASY: i want my job back, mr. giacomo. i need to work and i need a good job.
BENNY: is that all?
EASY: no, that's not all... i need money so that i can pay my mortgage and eat... i need a house to live in and a place to raise children... i need to buy clothes so i can--
BENNY: i'm sorry, fella, but i gotta get back to work...
EASY: ezekiel, mr. giacomo.
BENNY: hunh?
EASY: my name is ezekiel... ezekiel rawlins.

JOPPY: hey, watch the marble! dammit, what'd i tell you? 
EASY: joppy, how much they payin' out there at mcdonell douglas?
JOPPY: i don't know. don't it say--
JOPPY: easy, come on over here. this here's somebody i want ya to meet... come on. this here's a friend of mine.
JOPPY: yeah, easy. this here's mr.
ALBRIGHT: you can call me dewitt, easy.

EASY: how ya doin'? 
JOPPY: mr. albright and me goes back to before the war when i was still in the fight game.
ALBRIGHT: ever seen this guy fight...? any time joppy stepped in the ring you knew you were gonna see some real knock-down-drag-out- fisticuffs... where you from, easy?
EASY: houston.
ALBRIGHT: houston... joppy's hometown.
ALBRIGHT: so i hear you need a job.
JOPPY: aw yeah, easy always tryin' to do better. got his high school certificate from night school. he's threatenin' up on some college. and he's one of the few colored men around here who owns his own house. shoot, he pays a mortgage every month just like a white man.
ALBRIGHT: property owner, hunh?

ALBRIGHT: if you need a job, drop by this address at seven tonight. 
EASY: what kind of work you do?
ALBRIGHT: i do favors... i do favors for friends. drop by.
EASY: who the is that, joppy?
JOPPY: just somebody i know... a bidness man.
EASY: what kinda business?
JOPPY: oh, i don't ask him all that. he comes in here every so often looking for somebody to do a little job for him... he pays good.
EASY: in other words, he's a gangster.
JOPPY: i didn't say that... but if there's a dollar laying in the street i don't think he'll let a little dirt stop him from picking it up. if you worried about making that house note this month, maybe you wanna pay him a call. all them pretty girls you be with ain't gonna buy you a house.

JOPPY: sound like he just wants you to keep your eyes open for somebody... he'll pay you whether you see anything or not... if it was me i'd take that man's money and go on about my bidness... ain't nothin' to worry about. easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the card. 
EASY: when somebody tells me "don't worry," i usually look down to see if my fly is open... i noticed albright didn't bother to pay for his drink.

SECURITY GUARD: what are you doing here? 
EASY: i'm looking for, uh...
SECURITY GUARD: we only take deliveries between nine and six...
EASY: no, no... i...
SECURITY GUARD: yes, we do! now you'd better leave.
EASY: uh... albright!
SECURITY GUARD: what?
EASY: i'm here to see mr. albright.
SECURITY GUARD: where's your delivery?
EASY: i have an appointment -- i'm supposed to meet him.

SECURITY GUARD: did he give you a note to come in here after hours? 
SECURITY GUARD: well, did he? because if he didn't--
EASY: forget it, man. next time i see him i'll just tell him you wouldn't let me in.
SECURITY GUARD: hold on.
SECURITY GUARD: across that way to the left and down the stairs...

EASY: hey, man! what's wrong with you? 
TALL MAN: mr. rawlins, put your hands up a little from your sides, please.
EASY: keep your hands to yourself. i don't let no man feel on me like that.
TALL MAN: don't worry, manny. he's okay. just a little shaky. let him know.
ALBRIGHT: easy.
TALL MAN: he doesn't want us to touch him.
ALBRIGHT: leave it, shariff. i just wanted to make sure he was solo.
SHARIFF: you're the boss.
ALBRIGHT: you guys can go now. easy and i have some business.

ALBRIGHT: have a seat, mr. rawlins. 
EASY: your friends, hunh?
ALBRIGHT: like you, easy. i need a little help? i give 'em a call... drink?
EASY: sure.
ALBRIGHT: one thing i like about working for myself... i always have a bottle on the table... you wanna drink with me? fine. you don't? door's right behind you... joppy tells me you're a war hero... said you went in with patton.
ALBRIGHT: so, you want the job?
EASY: depends on what kind of job. i don't want to get mixed up in nothing.
ALBRIGHT: walk out the door in the morning, easy, and you're mixed up in something. only thing that matters is if you're mixed up to the top or not.

EASY: i mean i don't wanna get mixed up with the law... 
ALBRIGHT: neither one of us wants to get mixed up in that. that's just rich people trying to keep me and you in our place.
ALBRIGHT: i'm looking for somebody for a friend.

EASY: she leave him? 
ALBRIGHT: evidently... you know how it is with women, easy... happens to the best of us...
EASY: i ain't never heard of her before. i wouldn't know how to find a woman like that.
ALBRIGHT: that's a shame.

ALBRIGHT: see, daphne has a predilection for the company of negroes. she likes jazz and pigs feet and dark meat, know what i mean. 
EASY: so you think she might be down in watts.
ALBRIGHT: i'm sure of it. but i can't go looking for her myself because i'm not of the right persuasion, so to speak. i've been asking joppy for over a week, but all he could do was introduce me to you.
EASY: what do you want me to do?
ALBRIGHT: just get a location on her. mr.
EASY: that's all.
ALBRIGHT: that's all.
ALBRIGHT: one hundred dollars, and i pay in advance.
EASY: i just have to tell you where she is?
ALBRIGHT: that's right. and keep it, you know, confidential...

TERAN: i am the next mayor, mr. rawlins... and luckily for you, a friend of the negro... when i arrived at the station i knew right off that you were being improperly detained as is coretta's boyfriend, dupree brouchard. it's this sort of thing that my administration will not tolerate, mr. rawlins. absolutely will not... he sits back in his seat self righteously and offers a nod of assurance and awaits easy's gratitude... then after a moment...
TERAN: yes... coretta answered phones for a while in my campaign office on 103rd and western. in fact my people got her a job in the phone company. so when i heard what had happened i got out of bed immediately, personally because of my concern... was anyone there with you mr. rawlins besides mr. dupree brouchard?... any... other friends of coretta's?
EASY: no, sir...
TERAN: no young lady perhaps?

EASY: uh... miss monet-- 
DAPHNE: call me daphne.

DAPHNE: i can understand why you'd be nervous... because i threatened you with coretta... i'm very sorry, but i couldn't think of any other way to get you to come.

DAPHNE: easy, i'm sorry... don't be mad at me.
DAPHNE: come on. she tries to touch his arm and he pulls away.
DAPHNE: you really hate me, don't you?
EASY: how much further is it?
DAPHNE: around the next bend... you remind me of frank when he gets angry.
EASY: ain't nothin' about me like frank.
DAPHNE: your jaw sets just like his when--

DAPHNE: just park behind the studebaker.

DAPHNE: did you bring a gun or something?

JOPPY: i ain't lyin'... i don't even know her that good. she just asked me to help her. and she asked me not to tell nobody... i guess 'cause of her and frank green.

CARTER: --no. they can't!
BAXTER: i'll have baxter write you out a check.

DUPREE: letter? what kinda letter?

DUPREE: naw. but i know it was on account of her that coretta got killed.
DUPREE: everything between coretta and that daphne was always such a secret... i mean that ole girl didn't think nothin' about two- timin' on frank... she probably 'innerduced' coretta to one of them ole guys she knew... and when he came to the house after coretta... ...he found out she wasn't that kinda woman... cops said she fought him... aw my gawd... fought him 'cause she wouldn't have nobody but me-e-e... he buries his face into his hands and easy throws a sad but frustrated look to mouse.
DUPREE: aw gawd, i can't even go to sleep... 'cause i can still see her face that mornin' 'fore i went to work...

DUPREE: junior had been by and just left the house... and she came runnin' out to the car carrying her bible... and she said, 'keep this for me, baby.' 
DUPREE: police won't even let me go near her house. so it's the only thing i got left from her. it was a sign... i know it was a sign, 'cause she was so religious...
MOUSE: it's all right, big man... it's all right...

EASY: i got it. come on, i think that girl is gonna call again.

DAPHNE: okay, i'll give you seven. 
EASY: where'd you get seven thousand dollars from?
DAPHNE: never mind. i'll give it to you. easy, please. they're very important to me.
EASY: coretta's life was important to a few people too. what's say you tell me who killed her?
DAPHNE: easy, honey, i don't know.
EASY: 'honey?' do frank and carter really fall for that stuff? come on... you and todd carter have a fight and all of a sudden he doesn't wanna be mayor no more... you leave, he's worried but he can't even get his buddies in the police department to help him find you... and now you wanna buy some pictures of teran. why? 'cause he's got some dirt on you.
DAPHNE: easy, why don't you just take the money!
EASY: is that what frank told coretta?
EASY: was she being too nosy? or was she just being coretta and trying to bargain up the price?
DAPHNE: easy, please. how much do you want?

EASY: tell me. is frank your husband or your pimp? 
DAPHNE: easy, put the phone down.
EASY: why don't you try screaming again? 'cause i bet police like white women with boyfriends who hijack trucks...
DAPHNE: easy, please.
EASY: i bet they like pimps, and whores, too, who scam rich white men like carter runnin' for mayor.
DAPHNE: easy, please, put it down...
EASY: and i'm sure they like it when these white girls tell their colored men to lay low 'cause they killed a woman over some pictures of another rich white man.
OPERATOR'S VOICE: number please...
DAPHNE: frank is my brother.
OPERATOR'S VOICE: number please?

DAPHNE: we have different fathers. mine is white... frank doesn't even know that todd and i broke up. so far i've kept him out of all this. 
DAPHNE: see, coretta's the only one out here in l.a. besides my brother who knew about me... and about a month ago she took a job working for, of all people, matthew teran. she made friends with one of the girls in the office who told her that she'd heard that teran was a pedophile. and coretta got carried away and told her that todd carter was engaged to a colored woman. she was sorry and didn't think it would get to teran... but it did and he got a hold of my birth records.
EASY: who killed her, daphne?
DAPHNE: todd and i broke up and i paid a guy for the pictures of teran. but somehow coretta got them.
EASY: who killed her?
DAPHNE: it was an accident. coretta and i were still mad at each other. i mean, she threatened to sell teran the pictures.
EASY: who killed her goddammit!?

DAPHNE: joppy said she pulled a knife and tried to dump hot water on him... 
DAPHNE: i didn't mean to hurt anybody... it's just that with the pictures i can--
EASY: what? marry carter? be white again?
DAPHNE: don't judge me, easy! do you think i like pretending that i'm someone else? do you know how i've been treated by people, colored and white, when i've tried to live as a colored woman in a colored community. do you have any idea what any colored man whose ever been with me has had to go through? don't you dare judge me!
DAPHNE: come on, easy. help me.

DAPHNE: come on, you know it's the right thing to do... you know if things were different what would happen between us. 
EASY: i'll tell you what can happen between us. you get carter to clear me up from all this and you can have your pictures. that's all that could have ever happened between us.

EASY: albright's got the girl. he's gonna kill her. where would he take her? and you better get it right.
JOPPY: man, i don't--

JOPPY: there's a cabin out in malibu on route 9...

JOPPY: naw. it's farther up.
EASY: how much farther?
JOPPY: another ten minutes, i guess. easy, i swear, i ain't done nothin' to nobody. i swear, i ain't.

JOPPY: there it is. 
EASY: there's some rope in the trunk, raymond.
JOPPY: easy, come on, man. that girl is lying if she told you i killed them folks.
EASY: who said she told me?
EASY: stuff this in his mouth. i gotta get up there.

MOUSE: let's just shoot him. 
EASY: no, mouse. and they'll hear it.

ALBRIGHT'S VOICE: come on, talk to me. talk to me while you still can. 
DAPHNE'S VOICE: please! i don't have them! easy has them! easy can barely make out shariff passing the window. he strains to see more.
ALBRIGHT'S VOICE: you said he didn't know anything.
DAPHNE'S VOICE: i was lying!!
ALBRIGHT'S VOICE: okay. grab that for me, shariff. it's ready.
DAPHNE'S VOICE: no-o-o-o! please. no-o-o!
ALBRIGHT'S VOICE: now talk to me, goddammit!

DAPHNE'S VOICE: no-o-o! 
ALBRIGHT: who the hell's out there?
SHARIFF: i don't know!
ALBRIGHT: that you, easy?
ALBRIGHT: tell us what you want, buddy. see what we can work out.
EASY: mouse?

ALBRIGHT: easy... hey, buddy come on, goddammit! 
MOUSE: damn, damn, i hit him! i hit him!

MOUSE: there's blood all over here... i got him. 
MOUSE: sweetheart.
MOUSE: she okay?
EASY: yeah. let's go.

EASY: where's joppy? and then he looks around quickly, seeing joppy's body lying off on the side of the road. 
EASY: what happened?
MOUSE: i didn't have time to be tying him up.
EASY: why, man? why?

MOUSE: why what? you just said don't shoot him. and i didn't... i choked his ass... 
EASY: mouse! why?
MOUSE: how i'm gonna help you back there foolin' 'round with him?
EASY: he was tied up! why?!
MOUSE: aw, man. if you didn't want him kilt you shouldn't have left him with me.

EASY: because she was still in shock and couldn't really talk... maybe too because she had stolen about four times that much from carter. 
MOUSE: listen, if you think you gonna have trouble with that dude frank, i can run by and kill him and take that evening train to houston.
EASY: naw, man.
MOUSE: oh. this is for you.
MOUSE: i cut you in for half 'cause i knew you was too big a fool to take your share from that white girl yourself.
MOUSE: send my grip to etta mae. i'm gonna see if she'll take me back now that i'm flush.
MOUSE: oh, here's the keys to dupree's car.
MOUSE: and if you need somebody to run them streets with ya, gimme a call. you know how to put some money in a nigga's pocket.

EASY: i could tell how it was gonna go when carter asked us to meet him at the observatory instead of at his house... she knew it, too. but she had come this far and she had to play it out. 
CARTER: daphne! daphne, sweetheart!
DAPHNE: come on, easy. let's go.
DAPHNE: don't worry, you can give him the pictures yourself.

EASY: hey, i'm sorry. 
EASY: for the first time i felt that i could fall in love with her, too... i was even wondering if it was starting to happen when i dropped her off at 63rd and dinker where her brother, frank, was waiting... then it occurred to me that she still had carter's money... and i felt like a fool.

CARTER: here's the remaining eight hundred that i owe you... in cash... and another thousand which i hope will keep this whole thing... you know. 
CARTER: and i've taken care of your problems with the police. you'll have no more trouble there. and that's a promise.
CARTER: mr. rawlins... did daphne ever say... she loved me?
EASY: would it really matter if she did, mr. carter?

EASY: i'd been thinking about daphne, too... wondering if she meant what she said about what could have happened between us... but at the moment i was wondering if there was any such thing as a sprained chin. but other than that and a headache, a loose tooth and a kidney that a doctor would need to look at, i felt like five thousand, three hundred dollars... and unless albright was alive somewhere, that feelin' was gonna last a while. 
O.S. VOICE: hey, ezekiel.

MILLER: you got some mighty powerful friends up there... mighty powerful. but, see, we got a problem. 
MILLER: with the chief sealing these things up like this, it doesn't do much for the morale of the men who've been working on these cases.
MASON: yeah. makes 'em feel like
MILLER: there's a guy who's been callin' on the phone. and we're pretty sure that he was up there with mcgee.
MASON: a... uh... colored guy... sounds kinda dumb...
MILLER: not very bright... but he said you accused him of the murder. and he swears you were up there, too...
MASON: in fact, he's out and out pointing the finger at ya.
MILLER: how about a name?
MASON: he'd do it to you...
EASY: sorry, fellas. but i gotta go.

EASY: why don't you go back to the station and, uh... wait around for my call. 
MASON: you you watch yourself, you hear! don't you even spit on the sidewalk... i better not even-- mason's voice fades under.
EASY: it might be the last moment of my adult life spent free was walking away from city hall.

EASY: the paper treated the mysterious flip-flop like it happened every day. and i could tell that matthew teran wouldn't spend a day in jail... back in the second section of the paper was a small article about an unidentified man found dead, slumped over the steering wheel of a white cadillac just north of malibu... 
EASY: it scared me to think about a world that could kill a man like dewitt albright... what could a world like that do to me?
ODELL: hey, easy, where's your car?
