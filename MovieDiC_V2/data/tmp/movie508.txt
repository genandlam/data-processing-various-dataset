MR. HAT: okay, children, let's take our seats. 
MR. GARRISON: we have a lot to learn and precious little time.
MR. GARRISON: why is everyone wearing t-shirts of sigfried and roy?
KYLE: it's not sigried and roy, mr. garrison, it's terrance and phillip.

MR. GARRISON: well, anyway... today children, our friend mr. hat is going to tell us all about the environment. 
MR. GARRISON: that's right, mr. garrison. the environment is what surrounds us. it is what we live and breathe.
CARTMAN: i hate the environment.
KYLE: dude, how can you hate the environment?
CARTMAN: 'cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. i hate it. the kids all gasp!
MR. GARRISON: eric! did you just say the "f" word?
CARTMAN: fragile?
KYLE: no, he's talking about dude. you can't say in front of mr. garrison.
MR. GARRISON: kyle!

PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: i am very disappointed in you boys! you should be ashamed of yourselves! i've already called in your parents, but first i want you to think about what you've done.
CARTMAN: principal victoria, can i ask a question?
PRINCPAL VICTORIA: what?
CARTMAN: what's the big deal?
STAN: yeah.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: agh!! i want to know where you heard these horrific obscenities!

STAN: yeah!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: boys, i seriously doubt that mr. garrison ever said- 'eat penguin you sucking spelunker' in school! the boys all laugh.
STAN: oh, oh...
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: thank you all for coming on such short notice. as you can see, your boys are all being disciplined.
STAN'S MOTHER: this just isn't like you, stanley!
KYLE'S MOTHER: what did my son say, principal victoria? did he say the s word?
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: no, it was worse than that...
KYLE'S MOTHER: the word?!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: no, worse. here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
STAN'S MOTHER: oh dear
KYLE'S MOTHER: what is 'fisting'?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: that's when the fist is inserted into the or for sexual pleasure. the two moms stare at ms. cartman.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: what?
KYLE'S MOTHER: young man, you will tell peincipal victoria this instant where you heard all these horrible phrases!
KYLE: i can't dude! we all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
CARTMAN: it was the terrance and phllip movie!
STAN: dude!
CARTMAN: what? you guys, i wanna get out of here.
KYLE'S MOTHER: terrance and phillip movie?! oy gevalt!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: what is terrance and phillip?
KYLE'S MOTHER: terrance and phillip are two very untalented, unfunny actors from canada. their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage. now it appears they have a movie and i'm positive it's not suitable for children!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: well, it looks like i'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. i have to put a stop to this before more children see 'terrance and phillip'.
CARTMAN: everybody's already seen it.
MS. CARTMAN: eric!
CARTMAN: i'm sorry! i can't help it!! that movie has warped my fragile little mind.
KYLE'S MOTHER: alright, boys, that's enough. get out and let us adults speak.
KYLE'S MOTHER: we must take action on this immediately.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: ooh yes. i think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
KYLE'S MOTHER: forgive me for saying so, principal victoria, but your methods are too... shall we say... soft? as head of the pta, i am exercising my right under article 42 of the pta code.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: article 42! you don't mean-?!
KYLE'S MOTHER: yes principal victoria. the pta is impeaching you.
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: but i-
KYLE'S MOTHER: you are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
KYLE'S MOTHER: get out of that chair! the pta is in charge now!
KYLE'S MOTHER: attention students. we are now enforcing a new dress code at south park elementary. terrance and phillip shirts are no longer allowed in school. anyone wearing a terrance and phillip shirt is to be sent home immediately.

CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: can i finish? please? can i finish? ... 
NEWS ANCHOR: but minister, it isn't like this film is the first troublesome thing to come out of canada. let us not forget brian adams a few decades ago. the minister thinks.
CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: what?

STAN: but wendy, i can go-
WENDY: no. don't speak. you'll only make things more annoying. goodbye, stan.
KYLE: dude, anybody who doesn't think terrance and phillip is funny can off anyways.

CARTMAN'S MOTHER: you bastards.
KYLE'S MOTHER: this is it! the time for action is now!!
STAN'S MOTHER: i agree!

PHILLIP: cheers, terrance!
CONAN O'BRIAN: so, guys, i need to ask you a serious question...
PHILLIP: i just farted terrance back into the stone age! they both laugh hard.
BROOKE SHIELDS: i farted once on the set of blue lagoon!
TERRANCE: nobody cares, brooke shields!
CONAN O'BRIAN: terrance and phillip... whose idea was it, to have a person lighting a fart on fire in your movie?
CONAN O'BRIAN: say it! it was your idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie!
PHILLIP/TERRANCE: it was our idea to have someone light a fart on fire in your movie.

TERRANCE: phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by the conan o'brian show!! 
PHILLIP: this little sucker willfully deceived us! you are a bad man!
TERRANCE: and you call yourself a canadian! i told you we should of done leno!

CARTMAN: this could mean... no more terrance and phillip - ever!

CANADIAN AMBASSADOR: as the canadian ambassador, i hereby condemn the actions taken by america in apprehending terrance and phillip! 
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR: we demand their release immediately!! as you can see from this graph, the entire economy of canada relies on terrance and phillip! without them we are doomed to recession! the united nations head bangs his gavel.
KYLE'S MOTHER: if i may?
KYLE'S MOTHER: as president and founder of m.a.c., i would like to state-
UNITED NATIONS HEAD: excuse me, m.a.c.?
KYLE'S MOTHER: yes, mothers against canada.
UNITED NATIONS HEAD: kay.
KYLE'S MOTHER: i would like to state that canada must learn to stop infiltrating our country with its graphic art!
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR: last time i checked america was a free country!
KYLE'S MOTHER: look at this!
KYLE'S MOTHER: this woman's child was killed by your country's humor! look how upset she is!
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR: we will continue to sell terrance and phillip videos to anyone retarded enough to buy it!!
KYLE'S MOTHER: then you leave me no choice... i call for an embargo on all canadian imports!!!

CARTMAN: what the do you mean i can't get cheesy poofs?! 
BOB: sorry, kid. cheesy poofs are a canadian export. we can't carry them any more.
KYLE: who the made up that law?!
CARTMAN: you can't do this!! have you ever had cheesy poofs? they're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
BOB: there's nothing i can do. i can still sell you cheese-o's.
CARTMAN: cheese-os and you!

CARTMAN: come on, you guys... we have to think! 
STAN: about what?
CARTMAN: about cheesy poofs, dumbass! this whole thing has gone too far!
KYLE: i don't really think you need cheesy- poofs, tubby-
KYLE'S MOTHER: boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
KYLE: we already know what you did. we saw it on television.
STAN: yeah, how come you arrested terrance and phillip?
STAN'S MOTHER: stanly, you're too young to understand what's good for you. that's why we mothers have taken charge.
KYLE: but they didn't do anything wrong!
CARTMAN: yeah! and what rim job expert went and outlawed cheesy poofs!?
KYLE'S MOTHER: what was that word, young man!?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: oh, he said rim job. it's when someone licks your for-
KYLE'S MOTHER: i know what it is!
CARTMAN: lick someone's ass?!
KYLE'S MOTHER: the terrance and phillip movie has obviously done irreparable damage to their brains. we have to put them in rehab right away.
KYLE: what's that?
KYLE'S MOTHER: you boys need help. there are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
STAN'S MOTHER: there are?
KYLE'S MOTHER: well no, i guess not... but we will establish the first of its kind right here in south park. all the children in town will have to attend and receive treatment from the school counselor mr. mackey! ooh i just love when i get these sorts of ideas!
CARTMAN: why? so you can up our life some more?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: eric! don't talk to ms. brovlofski that way!
CARTMAN: but mom! i'm not addicted to bad language! i don't have a problem!

SATAN: fallen one... we have such sights to show you! 
SATAN: i am satan. i am your now.

SADDAM HUSSEIN: oh, a new recruit, huh? welcome to hell, kid! relax! take a load off!! 
SATAN: you remember... saddam hussein, don't you?!

MR. MACKEY: mkay, it's come to my attention, that you boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay. now the sooner you recognize your problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you back to your third grade homeroom where you belong. 
KYLE: but they're just words, mr. mackey. our parents are over-reacting.
BEBE: yeah, wendy's here, and she doesn't even like terrance and phillip!
CARTMAN: ugh... you guys, seriously... i'm having cheesy withdrawal...
MR. MACKEY: mkay, kids from all over the state have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. uh, young man... let's start with you.
GREGORY: my name is gregory... and i have a potty mouth. wendy looks at gregory. stan notices this.
CARTMAN: you've got a stupid accent too.
MR. MACKEY: eric, that is not appropriate.
CARTMAN: what? french people. 'em in the ear.
MR. MACKEY: mkay, you see, children. this is exactly what i'm talking about. we have to change the way you think.
GREGORY: how are you gonna do that?
MR. MACKEY: there are times when you get suckered in, by drugs and alcohol and with wom-en. but it's when you do these things too much

KYLE'S MOTHER: mr. mackey, what is going on?! 
MR. MACKEY: uh, we're just, starting our program...
KYLE'S MOTHER: this is not a place for fun and games! this is rehabilitation! now get to it!! we at mac have a trial to go to!
MR. MACKEY: mkay.
CARTMAN: it your mom is a kyle.

NEWS REPORTER: tom i'm standing in front of the u.s. supreme court where the most important trial of the - day - is happening. thousands of people have shown up from all over the country to show their outrage and disgust at canada. joining me now is mrs. mckormick, mother of the poor little boy who was killed by the canadians. 
NEWS REPORTER: mrs. mckormick, you must really hate the canadians.
KENNY'S MOTHER: yes, yes i do, tom.
NEWS REPORTER: did you ever think you would see the day when thousands of people were wearing your son kenny on t-shirts?
KENNY'S MOTHER: no i didn't. but if any of you would like one they're 14.95. available in blue or white.
NEWS REPORTER: well, we can only imagine the intense, vehement trial that is going on inside.
JOHNNY COCHRAN: terrance and phillip... you knowingly, with malice of forethought were trying to destroy american culture, yes or no?

TERRANCE: the americans are just showing their true colors as smelly bastards. 
PHILLIP: fight the power!
TERRANCE: the young boy that died lit himself on fire. it was unfortunate, but how can they blame us?
PHILLIP: don't believe the hype!!
KIDS: yeah! woohoo!
BACK TO COURTHOUSE: terrance and phillip laugh merrily.
TERRANCE: you cannot oppress us! we will continue to pursue our art. we know there are americans out there who will help us!
KYLE'S MOTHER: your 'art' is shallow and immature! we americans do not allow that for our children!!
PHILLIP: please. you teach your children that america is the land of the free. but it's all you're one of the most conservative countries in the world!

TERRANCE: the problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. you try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it. 
PHILLIP: yeah, no wonder your country is so up.

KYLE: what happened? 
WENDY: the station conveniently went blank.

CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: attention america!! you have taken our national treasure terrance and phillip. we, in turn, have taken yours... the smothers brothers! 
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: i'll let you catch your breath... now, release terrance and phillip, or else we will execute your beloved smothers brothers!!
TOMMY SMOTHERS: please listen to them!!
DICK SMOTHERS: they're not around!!
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: we're not around. this is not aboot deals. this aboot dignity. this is aboot freedom... this is aboot respect. return terrance and phillip now!!!
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: oh yeah... and you, america!

MR. MACKEY: okay kids, for today's rehabilitation activity, we're going to watch the terrance and phillip movie. 
STAN: what?!
KYLE: sweet!
MR. MACKEY: now, this is an edited version of the movie, which was put out by the mpaa. that's the motion picture association of america.
WENDY: isn't that censorship?
MR. MACKEY: no the mpaa is not a censorship group.
WENDY: why not?
MR. MACKEY: uh... because they say so... mkay. now i want you to watch this movie, with all the immature profanity taken out, and notice how much better a movie it becomes... mackey puts the tape in and hits play.

DUBBED PHILLIP: hey terrance. i feel like i'm going to pass gas near your head. 
DUBBED TERRANCE: i would rather you didn't, phillip.
DUBBED PHILLIP: oh? is that so?
TERRANCE: oh, you are such a maroon!
PHILLIP: you would know, dummy.
TERRANCE: you are pigeon-like in your intelligence.

KYLE: dude, they cut out 92 minutes! 
MR. MACKEY: so you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. and of course, the mpaa didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. what did you think?
CARTMAN: oh man, i'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of out of my mouth from that piece of movie.
MR. MACKEY: eric, you're not watching your mouth!
CARTMAN: you get me cheesy poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and i'll watch my mouth!
MR. MACKEY: eric!!!! you need to be rehabilitated.
CARTMAN: help yourself prickfuck!
MR. MACKEY: i am not a prickfuck, mkay? you little asshole!
CARTMAN: ha, ha, you stupid prickfuck.

KYLE'S MOTHER: how is the children's progress? 
MR. MACKEY: very encouraging. most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
KYLE'S MOTHER: what do you mean most, why not all?
MR. MACKEY: well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
KYLE'S MOTHER: then we'll have to resort to plan b and call the v-chip organization.
MR. MACKEY: mrs. brovlofski, the v-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.

KYLE'S MOTHER: as our next official order of business here at m.a.c., we will test the new v- chip. as most of you know, the v-chip was created to lock children out of watching certain shows on television. and now the n.i.h. has created a new, exciting product that they can tell us all about. here is the surgeon general, dr. pangloss.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: thank you, parents.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: the machinery of the new 'v-chip' is very simple, and similar to that of the v- chip. the chip is placed just under the subject's skin, where it emits a small but painful shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered. the parents are fascinated.
STAN'S FATHER: now wait a minute, are you telling us that this chip somehow knows if the kid is swearing?
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: it's just like a lie detector. certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie, the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: we are very excited to see the results of this test. patient 453, would you step out here, please? cartman steps out wearing a hospital gown.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
CARTMAN: my head hurts.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: don't worry about that. now, i want you to say 'doggy.'
CARTMAN: doggy.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: notice that nothing happens. now say 'montana.'
CARTMAN: montana.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: good. now 'pillow'.
CARTMAN: pillow.
DOCTOR PANGLOSS: alright, now i want you to say 'horsefucker.' cartman looks offstage to his mother.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: go ahead, it's alright, eric.
CARTMAN: horsefuck-

DOCTOR PANGLOSS: success!! our device works perfectly! we will begin mass production immediately!
