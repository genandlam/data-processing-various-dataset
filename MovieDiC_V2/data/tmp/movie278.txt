AMANDA: oh dear, i believe it's about that time- she pulls out a decanter of wine- 
AMANDA: would you care to join me?
DELILAH: no thank you.
AMANDA: of course you won't join me, you don't partake. that was thoughtless of me.

DELILAH: that's all right. 
AMANDA: so you don't take spirits and- what else? in your church?
DELILAH: i'm sort of between churches right now. i been thinking about changing over to the holiness, but i- i haven't been sanctified yet.
AMANDA: ah-
DELILAH: there's been a minister in this week-
AMANDA: the tent out by the fairgrounds.
AMANDA: the church i grew up in- we were pentacostals- they wouldn't have anything but the human voice inside the church. and dancing- any kind of dancing, music, card playing-- well, it was very strict. they took up serpents.
DELILAH: i've heard of that.
AMANDA: i tell floyd these stories and he's horrified. they've always been methodists, floyd's family.
DELILAH: they're good people too.
AMANDA: when i married floyd-- oh, it was quite a scandal among my relatives. as if i'd taken up with somebody in a cult.

DELILAH: it can be a trial, married folks differ in their religion. 
AMANDA: and your husband is a--- ?
DELILAH: unaffiliated.
AMANDA: unaffiliated. i see. he has his-- social club-
DELILAH: the honeydripper.
AMANDA: such a colorful name.
DELILAH: yes.
AMANDA: he must devote a great deal of his energy to it.
DELILAH: it's just him and maceo green runs it, and then i go over and cook some when i get off here.
AMANDA: that's very- supportive of you. considering the sort of- environment-
DELILAH: i been in those barrooms most of my life, miss amanda.

DELILAH: i was just kind of livin along, you know, drinking more than i ought-- then tyrone. it was like a light come into my life. 
DELILAH: people think things because he owns the lounge, but they don't know him.
AMANDA: small minds are never in short supply.
AMANDA: the people in this town--- she catches herself, smiles-
AMANDA: i suppose they expected that floyd, being from a prominent family- as prominent as is possible here in harmony- would have chosen somebody more-- she fades away again, empties her glass-
AMANDA: my people were very devout, but they weren't- financially successful.
DELILAH: no shame in that.
AMANDA: in school, if you didn't have shoes- she frowns at the memory, sighs-
AMANDA: oh, i forgot--

AMANDA: i was going through emily's old things the other day, and i thought this would look just darling on your china doll- 
DELILAH: oh- i don't think it would near fit her, miss amanda.
AMANDA: how old is she now?
DELILAH: seventeen.
AMANDA: oh my- i must have lost track somewhere along the line. seventeen.
DELILAH: it was a very nice thought.
CHINA DOLL: mama? they need you at- delilah shifts her eyes to indicate-
CHINA DOLL: oh, i'm sorry, miss amanda. i didn't know you was home.

TY: somebody we could find?
MACEO: hell, i don't know. just a story i heard.
TY: there must have been a first one.
MACEO: first what?
TY: back slavery days, they had the ones that worked in the big house. might not of had shoes always, but their pants didn't have no holes and they didn't pick no cotton.
MACEO: house niggers.
TY: that's how they called em. they must of had all their african kinda instruments- drums, shakers, some kind of banjo thing- but the piano-
MACEO: didn't bring no piano over on them ships from africa.

TY: the piano was just sittin there in the white folks' big room, all polished up-- and i figure this one boy, he goes past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it. and he's there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and whatever- ty plays something like a minuet- 
TY: -him standing there with a tray of white people food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know- but he's watchin the fingers, see, watchin them keys work. this old boy, the first one, he can play alla them africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo, he's got music in his head, in his heart, in every piece of him there's music.
MACEO: down to the bones--
TY: and one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to, and he's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench-
MACEO: watch out now-
TY: -and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do- and he- ty hits a minor chord, lets it decay-
TY: and he thinks- `lord help me, i could do some damage with this.'
75.: a silence. maceo is moved by the scene-
MACEO: would have liked to been there. i mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it.
TY: mace, imonna lose my club.
MACEO: old man toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that-
TY: i got no more cards to play-
MACEO: maybe if you was to go down, see lucky hardaway in person-
TY: i aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed-
TY: what the that sposed to be?
MACEO: some kind of guitar.
TY: a guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from. that boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs.

MACEO: naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see? you got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out-
MACEO: -your amplifier. which is what this thing must be.
CHINA DOLL: sonny said he fix radios in the army.

TY: sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's army, and some of em crawled in his head. surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton. judge gatlin bought himself a droolin what you want to amplify a guitar for anyway?
