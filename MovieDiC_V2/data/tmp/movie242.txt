CAPTAIN: what was that!? 
SKIPPER: i can't tell...

NICK: ..."i'm laughing at clouds, so dark up above..." 
NICK: ..."the sun's in my heart and i'm ready for love..."

NICK: ..."let the cloudy skies chase..." 
NICK: ..."i'm singin' in the mud, just scooping up my worms..."
NICK: good day. i am here with permission...i have a, a... permit. how do you say permit?
MALE VOICE: dr. nick topopolosis?
NICK: it's tatopoulos.
TERRINGTON: the worm guy, right? kyle terrington, u.s. state department.
NICK: what are they doing?
TERRINGTON: you've been reassigned.
NICK: you can't shut me down now! my research here's not finished!
TERRINGTON: it is now.

BRIEFING OFFICER: the japanese consulate has been calling and we've been getting pressure from the americans. 
RAYMOND: what did you tell them?
BRIEFING OFFICER: nothing yet.
RAYMOND: are there any other survivors?
BRIEFING OFFICER: only one, sir. he was very lucky.

RAYMOND: ask him what happened. 
RAYMOND: what did you see, old man?
OLD COOK: gojira...gojira...
SECOND OFFICIAL: i have no idea what he is saying.
OLD COOK: ...gojira!...gojira!...gojira!!

MAJOR HICKS: dr. niko topopolosis? 
NICK: it's tatopoulos.
MAJOR HICKS: right. the worm guy. can someone get those people off the beach?
NICK: excuse me, would you mind telling me what the i'm doing here?
MAJOR HICKS: follow me.
NICK: you didn't answer my question. in fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
MAJOR HICKS: we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.

NICK: look, i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field. 
MAJOR HICKS: we know.
NICK: do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the chernobyl earthworm?
MAJOR HICKS: yeah, you're the worm guy.
NICK: the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's dna! you have any idea what that means?
MAJOR HICKS: no, but i have the feeling i'm about to find out.
NICK: it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. mutated by seventeen percent?
MAJOR HICKS: seventeen percent, huh? sounds big.
NICK: they're enormous! a new species created by man's recklessness. that's what i've been trying to tell you, i'm only a biologist. i take radioactive samples and study them.
MAJOR HICKS: then you're perfect. here's your radioactive sample. study it.
NICK: what sample?
MAJOR HICKS: you're standing on it.
NICK: i don't see it. where is it?
NICK: i don't see it!

NICK: that was a footprint. i was standing inside a footprint. 
MAJOR HICKS: that's right.
NICK: but there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? is there?
MAJOR HICKS: we're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
NICK: somebody must have seen it.
MAJOR HICKS: it happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.

MAJOR HICKS: a tanker was attacked and sunk yesterday near the french polynesians. 
WOMAN SCIENTIST: is that the tape of the witness?
NICK: hi. nick tatopoulos...
ELSIE: ah, elsie chapman, paleontologist.

ELSIE: dr. craven, have you met the worm guy? 
DR. CRAVEN: nice to meet you.
OLD COOK: ...gojira...gojira...gojira...
ELSIE: what could have possibly done all that?

AUDREY: and i'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of caiman's expense p.o.'s. 
LUCY: speak of the devil.
LUCY: oh girl...

AUDREY: did you talk with humphries? 
CAIMAN: this is not the place...
AUDREY: just tell me, did you talk with him?
CAIMAN: he said he'd consider it. it's between you and rodriguez.
AUDREY: are you serious? he's going to consider me for he job? what else did he say?
CAIMAN: why don't i tell you over dinner tonight? your place.
AUDREY: mr. caiman, you're married.
CAIMAN: and you're beautiful...
AUDREY: mr. caiman...
CAIMAN: call me charlie.
AUDREY: mr. caiman, i've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. and i've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. i'm too old to be an assistant anymore. i need to know this job is going someplace.
CAIMAN: so have dinner with me tonight.
AUDREY: i can't.
CAIMAN: it's your choice.

ELSIE: three years digging up worms in chernobyl? how did mrs. tatopoulos handle it? 
NICK: oh, i'm not married.
ELSIE: really? a girlfriend then?
NICK: no. perhaps i work too much.
ELSIE: you mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
NICK: not for a long time, now.
ELSIE: well, i think you're cute.
NICK: oh, thank you. is she always like this?
CLIVE: i had to beat her off with a stick.

MAJOR HICKS: who are they? lieutenant, get those people away from there. 
RAYMOND: they are with me!
MAJOR HICKS: and who are you?
RAYMOND: chargeures, property and casualty insurance. we are preparing a report.
MAJOR HICKS: you're fast.
RAYMOND: that is our job.
MAJOR HICKS: well your people are getting in the way of my job.
RAYMOND: major, what do you think could have done this?
MAJOR HICKS: get your people out of there or i will.

PETERS: you okay, nick? 
NICK: yeah, i'm...wait...i lost...
RAYMOND: are you looking for this?
NICK: thanks.

LEONARD: jerry, why are we slowing down? 
JERRY: she's heavy in the bunt.
LEONARD: that was fast.

DECK HAND: the nets are full! 
JULES: then bring 'em in!
DECK HAND: we can't. she won't budge!

ARTHUR: what is going on? 
FIRST MATE: what the did we catch?
JULES: cut us free! cut the nets!
ARTHUR: cut the cables!

SOLDIER: major, we just got a report of a fishing trawler going down. exact position, forty seven degrees latitude, 67 longitude. 
MAJOR HICKS: what makes you think it's related?
SOLDIER: the trawler was pulled under.
MAJOR HICKS: christ! it's only two hundred miles off the american eastern seaboard and we don't even know what it is.

NICK: what about the traces of radiation? 
NICK: the radiation is not an anomaly, it's the
NICK: what do we know? it was first sighted off the french polynesian pacific. an area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
ELSIE: hence the radiation.
NICK: more than that. i believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
CLIVE: like your earthworms?
NICK: yes! we're looking at a completely incipient creature. the dawn of a new species. the first of its kind.

AUDREY: my life 
LUCY: oh, please, your life doesn't suck.
LUCY: shut up. how can you eat like that?
ANIMAL: big bites.
AUDREY: i can't believe he put the moves on me. after everything i've done for him.
LUCY: he's scum! as far as he's concerned you're just a pair of that talk.
ANIMAL: i like that image.
AUDREY: you know how i spent last weekend?
LUCY: i'm telling you he's dirt. he's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
ANIMAL: hey, hey! i'm eating here!
LUCY: audrey, you're too nice, that's your problem. nice gets you nothin' in this town. you gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what i'm sayin'? i'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
AUDREY: animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
ANIMAL: nice guys finish last. first rule of the jungle.
AUDREY: well, i can be tough if i want.
ANIMAL and LUCY: yeah, sure.
AUDREY: oh my
AUDREY: it's nick! i know that guy. i know him!
LUCY: who is he?
AUDREY: he was my college sweetie! look at him. he looks so handsome on t.v. what the is he doing in panama.

MAYOR: i'd like to thank you all for coming out on this beautiful new york city day. 
MAYOR: when i came into office four years ago, people didn't think we could reduce crime and i did.
COP: yeah,
MAYOR: ...and i did. the city is a safer place today...

SECRETARY: mr. caiman. i think your story just walked by the window. 
CAIMAN: what?

LUCY: did romeo have a name? 
AUDREY: nick tatopoulos.
ANIMAL: that why you dumped him?
AUDREY: no! i just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. i wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
LUCY: and now you live the glamorous life of caiman's assistant. life's a ain't it?
ANIMAL: how long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
AUDREY: nearly four years...
LUCY: four years. girl, i'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
AUDREY: that's the problem. he did.
LUCY: tell me that's not another parade.

SERGEANT: sergeant o'neal, sir. 
MAJOR HICKS: any word from the mayor's office?
SERGEANT: they've agreed to evacuate the city. they've called out the national guard and riot police are on alert.
ELSIE: evacuate manhattan? that's over three million people. has that ever been done before?
NICK: i don't think so.
MAJOR HICKS: status report?
SERGEANT: we've lost sight of it, sir.
MAJOR HICKS: you want to run that by me again?
SERGEANT: after the initial attack he just...disappeared.
OFFICER: major, secretary of defense burk on the line. this takes major hicks off guard. the last person he wants to talk to. nick walks over to the sergeant.
NICK: i don't understand. how can something that large just disappear?
SERGEANT: we're not sure. we're scanning the area now.
ELSIE: he probably returned to the river. just like everywhere else we've been, we're always one step behind.
NICK: i don't think so.
NICK: i mean, look at it. it's perfect. an island, water on all sides. but like no other island in the world, this is a place where he can easily hide. he's in there someplace.
SOLDIER: channel eight caught it on film!
CAIMAN: ...wnew's exclusive images of the creature were taken less than a half hour ago. nick and elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight of the immense creature.
CAIMAN: cameraman victor "animal" palotti barely survived this vicious attack to provide us with this footage.

CO-WORKERS: way to go animal! that's my man! 
AUDREY: great stuff, animal. weren't you scared?
ANIMAL: sure i was. i thought lucy was gonna kill me.
LUCY: right, you crazy wop!
MURRAY: people! we have to be completely relocated to the new jersey station before our 5:30 broadcast. okay, caiman, devoe and animal, you're on the helicopter. everyone else we'll see you in jersey.
ANIMAL: gotta go, honey. you guys gonna be all right?
LUCY: audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
ANIMAL: great. see ya then.

AUDREY: caiman, wait. take me with you. 
CAIMAN: what?
AUDREY: i've got something on this. i know a guy on the inside with the military...
CAIMAN: not now. you got my bag?
AUDREY: you don't understand, i can get us information...
CAIMAN: listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay honey?
CAIMAN: the bag?
LUCY: come on, girl, we've gotta go!

CAIMAN: ...in what city officials are calling the worst act of destruction since the world trade tower bombing... 
CAIMAN: ...police and the national guard have quarantined off over twenty square city blocks...

WOMAN: i don't understand why we have to leave our homes. it's over already, isn't it? 
MAN: what are we running from? a big lizard? i've got cockroaches in my building that could kick the out of it.

MAYOR: who the are they? 
AIDE: it's a contingent of building owners and community business representatives.
MAYOR: i don't have time for this nonsense.
AIDE: most of them are campaign contributors.

MAYOR: i share your concerns. i want to get the city back in business as soon as possible. 
RAYMOND: who waits for the mayor. the mayor is momentarily stopped.
RAYMOND: chargures insurance. we represent nearly thirteen percent of the buildings in your city.
MAYOR: if you'll excuse me...
RAYMOND: we are very happy that you are in control of this situation.
RAYMOND: you can count on our emotional and financial support.
MAYOR: oh, well, thank you very much.

CAIMAN: hurry, we're going to miss the mayor. 
POLICE OFFICER: sorry, you gotta have a press id past this point.
CAIMAN: don't you watch t.v.?
POLICE OFFICER: can we see your press pass, sir?
CAIMAN: i had one here on my bag. where the did i put it?

LUCY: what the are you doing? 
AUDREY: remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
LUCY: your old sweetheart?
AUDREY: yeah, well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post. somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama. there's a story here. i know it. you got any tape or glue?
LUCY: i left my forgery kit back at the office.
AUDREY: hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
KID: what's it to you?
AUDREY: can i use some?
KID: what do i get?
AUDREY: the warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
KID: five bucks.
AUDREY: you're kidding, right?
P.A. ANNOUNCER: please exit the station. for those of you without accommodations, the city has opened up shelters on monroe and 60th and at bergenline and 72nd. please exit the...
AUDREY: wish me luck!
LUCY: audrey, i don't think this is a very good idea. caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
AUDREY: i'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, luce. if there's a story here i'm going to find it.

RAYMOND: merci. 
RAYMOND: you call this coffee?
MAN: i call this america.
MAYOR: you're telling me that in an election month i've evacuated the entire city for nothing?

MAYOR: do you realize what this evacuation will cost the people of this city!? 
ADMIRAL PHELPS: we're been monitoring the waters around the island. as far as we can tell it hasn't left the area.
MAYOR: but you don't know for sure.
MAJOR HICKS: we think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
MAYOR: but you
SERGEANT O'NEAL: sir, that may be more difficult than we originally projected.
MAJOR: more good news?!
SERGEANT O'NEAL: we've run into a problem.

LT. ANDERSON: we were checking the office building above when we discovered the floor was gone. 
LT. ANDERSON: when we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
MAJOR HICKS: christ. how many tunnels lead off the island?
LT. ANDERSON: only five, sir. we've checked them all. he hasn't used any of them.
MAJOR HICKS: have them sealed off.
LT. ANDERSON: and how should we do that, sir?
MAJOR HICKS: fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, i don't know, just make sure that thing doesn't leave the island!

NICK: you know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. he's just an animal. 
MAJOR HICKS: what are you suggesting?
NICK: when i needed to catch earthworms, i knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. i had to draw them out.

MAJOR HICKS: where are they now? 
RADIO TECHNICIAN: delta niner, what is convoy position?

RAYMOND: you said this was french roast! 
RAYMOND: more cream.

SERGEANT O'NEAL: i sure hope your plan works. 
NICK: i'm kind of hoping the same thing.

AIDE: tres bizarre. 
RAYMOND: no. very clever.

NICK: i need your radio. 
NICK: sergeant o'neal, the subway vents. we have to shut them down...
NICK: ...with the air pressure pushing up, he'll never smell the bait!
SERGEANT O'NEAL: get some men down into those air vents. shut 'em down!

MAJOR HICKS: commence phase one. let's gas it! 
SERGEANT O'NEAL: let 'em fly!

MAJOR HICKS: o'neal, what the is going on there!? 
SERGEANT O'NEAL: he's gone, sir. echo division's in pursuit.

LOOTER #1: jimmy, let's go. 
LOOTER #2: wait. i want this. help me!

HELICOPTER PILOT: we have him, locked on. 
MAJOR HICKS: then fire it!

HELICOPTER PILOT: that is a negative impact. 
MAYOR: negative impact!?! it's the chrysler building, that's what it is!
MAJOR HICKS: you said he was locked on!
HELICOPTER PILOT: the heat seekers can't lock. he's colder than the buildings around him.

HELICOPTER PILOT #4: i don't know sir. he just vanished. 
HELICOPTER PILOT #4: oh

SERGEANT O'NEAL: i can't believe it. he did all this and we did nothing to him. 
NICK: that's not true. we fed him.

ANCHOR: while it may have looked like beirut, it was in fact, manhattan where man and nature have collided with brute force. 
ANCHOR: the president today declared a state of emergency and has issued disaster relief funds to new york city.

REPORTER #1: ...rumors continue to mount as to the origin of this, perhaps, lost dinosaur... 
REPORTER #2: ...having shut down the united nations in the evacuation, foreign diplomats are demanding an international coalition be assembled to track the creature...
CAIMAN: ...maintaining a total media blackout, officials remain silent this evening as to their progress in containing this creature...

PHARMACIST: can i help you, young man? 
NICK: do you have any home pregnancy tests? especially ones that test for catastrophic hormones or clomiphene citrate.
PHARMACIST: this is all we've got.
NICK: i'll take them all.
AUDREY: you must have quite some harem.
NICK: audrey?! is that you? hi, hello. you look, wow, uh, how've you been?
AUDREY: it's good to see you, nick.
NICK: so you made it.
AUDREY: what?
NICK: you're a reporter. that's what you always wanted to be, right? i'm happy for you. really, i am.
AUDREY: yeah, well...

AUDREY: so, you still picking apart cockroaches? 
NICK: no, i'm into earthworms now. you wouldn't be interested. they're real "boring" creatures. very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
AUDREY: you're still mad at me, aren't you?
NICK: you just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. all this time.
AUDREY: that was eight years ago. some people change, you know.
NICK: most people don't.
AUDREY: i'm sorry you feel that way.
NICK: wait. i'm sorry. you're right. eight years is a long time. can i offer you a cup of tea?
AUDREY: sure. i'd like that.
AUDREY: one, thing, though. who'd you get pregnant?

AUDREY: i still can't believe it. how does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission? 
NICK: when you and i use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. but from the inside now i can actually effect change. i never lost my idealism.
AUDREY: and exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
NICK: i have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
AUDREY: and you think this creature is one of them?
NICK: yes. the first of its kind. i found this blood sample earlier this evening...
AUDREY: blood sample? how close did you get to that thing?
NICK: i got pretty close.
AUDREY: what else do you know about it?
NICK: well, we know he eats fish, he's of reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's amphibious and...
NICK: ...he's
NICK: well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
AUDREY: i don't get it. if it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
NICK: the ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. that's why he came to new york. like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
AUDREY: nesting?
NICK: yes. do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
NICK: forgive me but i've got to get this into the lab, to confirm all this. i'll be right back.

COOK: ...gojira...gojira... 
NICK: audrey? audrey?

AUDREY: ...which is why in this case "all the kings horses and all the kings men" may not be able to put the big apple together again. audrey timmons, wnew. we pull back to reveal audrey, animal and an editor, ed, watching the piece. 
ED: that's it. you owe me a breakfast.
AUDREY: so, what do you think?
ANIMAL: it's good. it's a real good piece. but how'd you get a hold of this material?
AUDREY: like you said, "good guys finish last."

AUDREY: murray, i need you to look at this tape. 
MURRAY: not now, audrey, we've about to go live with the morning report.
AUDREY: you're going to want to include this. i've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked.
MURRAY: you do? who's story is this?
AUDREY: mine!

JEAN-CLAUDE: taisez-vous. 
MALE VOICE: ...major hicks, what makes you believe another attempt to gun that creature down will work?

MAJOR HICKS: general anderson, the problem was the terrain. if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park... we should be able to take him down. 
MAYOR: last time you didn't even scratch it!
MAJOR HICKS: that's not true. our worm guy, er, i mean, dr. tatopoulos found blood.
NICK: well, yes. i did. clearly he was injured and bled.
MAJOR HICKS: you see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
NICK: um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
GOVERNOR: are you trying to tell us there's
MAYOR: then how can it be pregnant? what is this, the "virgin lizard?" there's a smattering of laughter in the room.
NICK: no, it reproduces asexually. that's why we must find the nest. if we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
MAJOR HICKS: so after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
NICK: it may be too late by then. these eggs will hatch very quickly.
CLIVE: how could you possible know that?
NICK: the fish. the fish we found down in the subway. he's not gathering all that food for himself. he's preparing to feed his young.

MAJOR HICKS: if dr. tatopoulos is right, we must act quickly before this problem escalates. 
GENERAL ANDERSON: you want to divide our efforts based solely on a wild theory?
MAJOR HICKS: he's come through for us before and if he feels strongly...
GENERAL ANDERSON: come through for you!? major, your campaign's a disaster. you weren't even able to to prevent this thing from coming to manhattan.
GOVERNOR: excuse me gentlemen, but i think we should see this.
GENERAL ANDERSON: how the did this get out?
CAIMAN: from an old japanese sailor's song called

JEAN-CLAUDE: merde! 
RAYMOND: allez, allez!
CAIMAN: ...a path can be traced back from manhattan, to jamaica, back to panama and all the way back to the french polynesians where nuclear testing has been going on for over twenty years...

CAIMAN: ...but why? research team member dr. niko padopolus believes the creature is nesting, using manhattan as ground zero to cultivate his species... 
GENERAL ANDERSON: you went to the press with this?
NICK: no, i didn't...i didn't talk with anyone.
GENERAL ANDERSON: they mentioned you by name!
NICK: yes...but i...
MAJOR HICKS: you gave them the tape?
NICK: no, it's still in my tent. it's...oh my she took it.
GENERAL ANDERSON: pack your stuff. you're officially off this project as of now.
AUDREY: he stole my report! that's
CAIMAN: ...and in this reporter's opinion, "all the kings horses and all the kings men"...
AUDREY: caiman you suck!

ELSIE: i'm sorry about all this. 
NICK: me too.
NICK: make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
ELSIE: i'll try.
ELSIE: bye worm guy.

CABBY: where to? 
NICK: newark airport.
AUDREY: you're leaving? why?
AUDREY: is this cause of me? because of the story?
NICK: well what the did you
NICK: i shouldn't have to, audrey. you're supposed to be my friend. i trusted you.
AUDREY: i didn't mean for it to turn out like this. look, i lied to you. i'm not a reporter. when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure i'd make it. but i haven't. that's why i needed this story so bad. i just couldn't tell you i'm a failure.
NICK: so you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
NICK: good luck in your new career. i think

T.V. NEWS BROADCAST - VIDEO: we see images from crowed refugee shelters. 
REPORTER: ...every shelter in the tri-state area has been overflowing with displaced people. tent cities have begun to spring up all over the county... as we track away from the t.v. we find nick taking a seat at a small bar next to the gate. a waiter comes over.
WAITER: can i get you something?
RAYMOND: pernot, no ice.
NICK: do i know you?
RAYMOND: we've met before.
NICK: oh yeah, the insurance guy.
RAYMOND: sdece, service de documentation exterieure et de contre-espionnage.
NICK: sounds like a big company.
RAYMOND: it's the french secret service.
NICK: oh.
RAYMOND: we have learned that your american friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
NICK: are you sure? how do you know?
RAYMOND: we know.
NICK: why are you telling this to me?
RAYMOND: i need you to trust me.
NICK: why do you need that?
RAYMOND: i need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
NICK: oh, my bags. i've checked them in.
RAYMOND: we, have already taken care of them.
RAYMOND: bon chance!

NICK: how did you get all of this stuff into the country? 
RAYMOND: this is america. there is nothing you can not buy.
NICK: so why all the secrecy? why aren't you guys working
NICK: you said you wanted my trust, then i need yours.
RAYMOND: i am a patriot. i love my country. can you understand that?
NICK: sure.
RAYMOND: it is my job to protect my country. sometimes i must even protect it from itself. from mistakes we have made. mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
NICK: your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific.
RAYMOND: yes. this testing done by my country left a terrible mess. we are here to clean it up.

JEAN-CLAUDE: they will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten. 
RAYMOND: that is when we will go in.
RAYMOND: we know how to get into the city. we just do not know where to start looking.
NICK: here. 23rd street subway station. where we first found the fish. with a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
RAYMOND: so you're in?
NICK: are you kidding? i always wanted to join the french foreign legion.

ANIMAL: who the are all these people? 
LUCY: what? i just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
ANIMAL: where's audrey?
LUCY: in the bedroom. crying her eyes out because of you.
ANIMAL: what?
LUCY: all that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
ANIMAL: me!? you where the one...
LUCY: go in there. talk to her.

GENERAL ANDERSON: that's why i'm holding this conference. to try and avoid a needless panic. 
GENERAL ANDERSON: contrary to some frivolous reports, we have no information to lead us to believe that there are any eggs of the creature in the city.
AUDREY: stupid idiots!
ANIMAL: you okay?
AUDREY: it's all my fault. what have i done, animal? what have i become? look at me. this isn't me. i don't do things like this.
ANIMAL: you made a mistake.
AUDREY: yeah, i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
ANIMAL: didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
AUDREY: yeah. why are you asking?
ANIMAL: i just saw him. he's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
AUDREY: my he's going after the nest.
ANIMAL: perfect! you wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
AUDREY: animal, i can't.
ANIMAL: look, you want to make it up to your friend? well if he's right, this is your chance.
AUDREY: i don't know. i've already made such a mess of things...
AUDREY: what are you doing?
ANIMAL: lucy'd kill me if she knew.

NICK: what's with the chewing gum? 
RAYMOND: makes us look more american.
NICK: just let me do all the talking.

AUDREY: what are you doing? 
ANIMAL: it's the maintenance entrance. runs along the side of the tunnel. when they repaired it last year i worked on a piece about it.

GUARD: who you boys with?
