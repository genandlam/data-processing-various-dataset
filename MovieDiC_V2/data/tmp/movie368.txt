speaker2: that's it for today, guys, very busy schedule, thank you!!

speaker1: what's the damage? 
speaker2: we're down nine points in the polls.
speaker3: in fifteen minutes?
speaker4: and dropping.
speaker3: it's a disaster.

speaker1: what's the spin? 
speaker2: i called the times and the chronicle, they're gonna play the whole thing off as a joke.
speaker3: thank
speaker1: how the did this happen?
speaker3: i have no idea. i thought he was out of town.
speaker1: jen, i gave you specific orders to get some handlers and keep brad locked down until after the announcement.
speaker4: i did! they flew to the ranch in maui last night!
speaker1: maui?! wasn't he at the villa in south hampton?
speaker3: i thought he was at the chalet in aspen.
speaker5: nope... it was the compound in bermuda.
speaker1: oh for sake! can't we -- brad enters and tom shuts up.
speaker6: yo, pops, that was off the hizzook! i just got you another million votes right dare!

speaker1: what are you doing here, son? 
speaker2: i knew i had to show up in order for you to blow up. so i had captain tony fire up the lear jizzy and booya! i'm in da hizzy, gonna be on the campaign trizzy, 24/seven, you know, kissin' babies and whatnot. pound it!
speaker3: bill, you've got to shut this down, now. tell brad he can't work with you, period.
speaker1: no, no. i love his enthusiasm... it's just a little misguided. there must be something he can do for the campaign, where he can't hurt us.
speaker3: such as...?
speaker1: i don't know... phones, stuffing envelopes, making signs, something.

speaker1: bill gluckman's down with the and ho's'? 
speaker2: it was supposed to read, 'women are first with gluckman.'
speaker3: that's old school. pops, you got to keep your pimp hand strong.

speaker1: that's it, bill. if brad doesn't straighten up, your political career is finished. 
speaker2: no, tom. i promise you, i will not lose this election over my son.
speaker1: what are you going to do?
speaker2: set up an appointment with my shrink.

speaker1: so... bradley... 
speaker2: why you keep callin' me dat?
speaker1: well that's your name, isn't it?
speaker2: it's my slave name, a'ight? i told you like fi'ty times.
speaker1: yes, okay... b-rad...
speaker2: wassup?
speaker1: let's play an association game.

speaker1: alright, b-rad. i want you to look at these... 
speaker1: now, which one doesn't belong?
speaker2: shoot. n.w.a., fool. they broke up a long time ago.
speaker3: dammit, brad, stop acting like a gang member. you're from malibu, you live in a nice home...
speaker4: with nice maids!
speaker1: bill, bess, go to your happy places.
speaker1: what are your goals, b-rad? what do you want out of life?
speaker2: to be the biggest rapper dere ever was! see, i got something to say, and i need the world to hear it. i'm the shiznit. i'll buy y'all cars!
speaker1: i see. and when did you first start feeling like you were this... shiznit?
speaker2: oh, way back in the day. i've had these beats in my head since i was a little shortie...

speaker1: gluckman residence. 
speaker1: no, bill and bess are out of the country until december.
speaker2: from then on it was hip-hop 24/seven.

speaker1: finish those vegetables, bradley. 
speaker2: you can't be excused until you do.
speaker3: tch. forget y'all.
speaker2: that's it, mister.
speaker1: when we get home... sometime in the near future... you're going to be in big trouble!!

speaker1: what i'm sensing, brad, is that your parents weren't really there for you. 
speaker2: nope.
speaker3: that's ridiculous!
speaker4: what about your bar mitzvah?

speaker1: mazel tov, bradley! 
speaker2: what's the theme of your party, kid? star wars? baseball? superheroes?
speaker3: it's o.p.p.,

speaker1: bess, i'm sensing you'd like to share. 
speaker2: b-rad, you're a wonderful son...
speaker3: oh stop beating around the bush, bess. what we're trying to say is, brad, that your behavior is, well, it's an embarrassment to the family.
speaker4: yo, pops, that hurts my feelings.
speaker3: i'm sorry, but it's the truth.
speaker4: don't be hatin'.
speaker3: and, brad... i can't have you on the campaign any longer.
speaker4: what?! oh that's how it is? a'ight then. i'm audi! i need to take a drive.

speaker1: what can we do, doctor? 
speaker2: well, his lack of parental guidance left brad wide open to outside influence, allowing hip- hop culture to firmly imprint on his psyche.
speaker3: do you think we can bring him back?
speaker2: i don't know. this is the most advanced case of gangsta-phrenia i've ever seen.
speaker1: oh no, not gangsta-phrenia!

speaker1: bradley, i know you're busy, but we need to talk. 
speaker2: what's up?
speaker1: after our therapy session i realized that your father and i could have been better parents. we neglected you and i feel terrible.

speaker1: for real? 
speaker2: yes. so from here on out i'm going to be a better mother. i want to get closer to you... be there for you. if ever you need --
speaker2: hello? celeste! when did you get back?! what?! oh my i've been waiting for that bag for six months! it's my personal shopper. stay right there. i'm on my way!
speaker2: so... where we... oh yes. i'm always here for you, bradley. do you have my cell number?

speaker1: gladys? 
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: ever feel like you don't belong?

speaker1: what do you do about it? 
speaker2: nothin' to do but keep it real.
speaker1: yeah, you right... gladys, when they gonna leave our people alone?
speaker2: i don't know, baby, i just don't know... eat your greens before they get cold, boy. a pager goes off. brad searches his pockets, pulls out a pager -- that's not it; pulls out another pager -- that's not it either; pulls out a two-way -- that's the one.
speaker1: oh no, not again!

speaker1: how'd it go with feldman? 
speaker2: great news. if he sees brad five days a week, he says we'll see improvement in three to four years.
speaker3: but... the election's in two months.
speaker2: right, good point.

speaker1: we've been brainstorming on some different approaches, and i think we may have something solid here. 
speaker2: i'm all ears.
speaker1: guys?
speaker3: brad might act 'ghetto,' but let's face it, he's never been east of beverly hills.
speaker4: but what if we give him a little dose of reality?
speaker5: let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto.
speaker2: you mean, have brad actually... go there?
speaker1: exactly.
speaker2: sounds dangerous...
speaker3: it'll be perfectly safe.
speaker2: how does it work?
speaker4: we hire actors to play gangsters.
speaker1: they car-jack brad, then take him on a 'tour' of the 'hood... give him a little taste of what thug life's really like. it might just scare the black out of him.

speaker1: excuse me? 
speaker2: look, i'm as down as the next brother, guy... fellah. i grew up in compton, okay? but let's get over the p.c. thing and face facts. unless we do something soon, brad's gonna cost us this election.
speaker3: i don't know... it sounds so drastic.
speaker2: maybe drastic is what brad needs, bill. he is twenty-four. i mean, what's he gonna do for a living, rap?
speaker3: who do we get for the gangsters?
speaker2: remember the anti-crime spot we shot last month?
speaker4: we've got it cued up. they turn to the tv and gary hits play.

speaker1: bill gluckman wants to put our divisions behind us. 
speaker2: fellas, instead of thinking of yourselves as what set you're from, or what crew you're rolling with, why can't you both be brothers. what do you say?
speaker3: i guess we never thought of each other like that.
speaker4: me neither, dawg.
speaker2: you see... 'california is my family'...
speaker2: if we work together as a family there's no telling how high we can go.

speaker1: those are our guys, right there. 
speaker2: will he be safe?

speaker1: absolutely. 
speaker2: i don't know... can't we just...
speaker2: alright, fine, just do it.

speaker1: lemme go. 
speaker2: you don't want to see him like dis.
speaker1: what happened?
speaker2: he o.d.'d again.
speaker1: why didn't you stop him?
speaker3: i tried, yo!
speaker1: how many did he do?
speaker2: like twelve, thirteen, i don't know!
speaker1: twelve frapachizzo's. brotha's caffeined out. move aside.

speaker1: i'ma get mine! step, fool! i'll cut you, i swear! 
speaker2: just chill, hadji, we're here to help. what's up?
speaker1: i... i... i was pickin' up aromatherapy candles at illuminations for moms, right? and the counter trick gave me lemon when i specifically axed for lilac!
speaker2: it's on now!

speaker1: yo, fool! we got some hard-core drama 'bout to go down right neow!! 
speaker2: dat's right!
speaker1: dis is our mall. always was and always will be!
speaker3: woof woof!
speaker4: oh, mr. amiraslani. i'm so glad you came back. our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles. here you go.
speaker1: you better be validatin' my parking?
speaker4: of course, sir.
speaker1: dat's what i'm talkin' 'bout. we get ours!

speaker1: hold the phone, buddy... you want us to scare this kid until he starts acting like a nice little white boy again? 
speaker2: don't think you can handle it?

speaker1: of course i can handle it. i studied at juilliard for sake. 
speaker2: fantastic.
speaker2: here's some background information on brad.

speaker1: he considers himself a 'rapper.' 
speaker2: frickin' a.
speaker1: okay, so here's the story -- it's your basic kidnapping...
speaker2: so we hold him for ransom?
speaker1: right. but when you see him acting ghetto and all, it you off so much, you tour him around the 'hood to show him what things are really like. i had my guys brainstorm a few ideas...

speaker1: 'mugging, drive-by shooting, crack deal gone bad...' 
speaker2: why don't you have him steal some watermelon while you're at it?
speaker3: pays fifteen grand apiece.
speaker4: we're in.
speaker3: good.
speaker2: wait -- we're kidnapping him, couldn't we get arrested?
speaker3: got you covered. mr. gluckman's a billionaire -- if you run into any problems with the law, we're very close with the commissioner. on the flip side, if you screw up and a single hair is touched on bradley's over-privileged head, i will make sure that you do serious time. clear?
speaker2: cris... tal.
speaker3: good.
speaker1: what about the money?
speaker3: five up front, twenty-five when you return him to us, white.
speaker2: ... as the driven snow.

speaker1: i'll call you. 
speaker2: congrats, my brother. we just booked another gig.
speaker3: yeah, but it's totally dangerous, dude. you know what it's like in the 'hood. we could get shot!
speaker2: we can handle ourselves. come on, man, it's the ultimate acting challenge.
speaker3: you know what really chaps my ass? after years of training and study, the only parts they'll give us are gangbangers. just once i'd like to play a character who has decent grammar and doesn't wear timberlands.
speaker2: beats gettin' dunked on by bill gluckman.
speaker3: do we even know anybody down there?
speaker2: my cousin.
speaker3: shondra.

speaker1: honest to 
speaker2: that's the stupidest thing i ever heard. i got better things to do with my time, boy.
speaker1: like work at wienie in a bun?
speaker3: really. you're the one always talkin' about improvin' yourself.
speaker2: i am improvin' myself, fool. i broke up with no-good gang-bangin' tec, i'm going to beauty school, then i'ma hook up my own salon...
speaker3: in the meantime, how about hooking a brother up with a pepsi and some fries?
speaker2: shut up, stupid.
speaker1: do this, shondra. you'll get some real money so you can quit this minimum wage and start up your business.
speaker2: what you payin'?

speaker2: or you can kiss my ass.
speaker3: deal. now how about those fries?

speaker1: we're strapped now, my brother.

speaker1: glocks, uzis, tec-9s...
speaker2: what the is that?
speaker1: oh, my hair? shondra just did it. what? you hate it?
speaker2: no. i just think it's a choice my character would have made.
speaker1: don't go there, sean. you're just jealous you didn't think of it first.
speaker2: whatever.

speaker1: what's so funny? 
speaker2: that wig, man! i didn't know this was halloween. bring me back some candy!
speaker1: whatever.

speaker1: his face filled with rage.

speaker2: gays too.
speaker3: there's no way we can win without them.
speaker4: yep?
speaker5: i have a sean on the phone for you, sir.
speaker4: put it through.

speaker2: brad's been kidnapped for real.
speaker3: what?
speaker2: they want five hundred grand or they'll kill him.
speaker4: oh my
speaker2: now let's not panic. lemme just think this through for a minute. we could have a very interesting opportunity here.
speaker3: where are you going with this?
speaker2: well, the negatives are obvious.

speaker1: bill drops out of the race, emotional distress... 
speaker2: i can handle bill. let's brainstorm the positives.
speaker3: there's so many. no more 'brad problem.'
speaker4: right, right, i'm liking it.
speaker1: with a dead son, the sympathy factor could give us big spike in the female and gay demos.
speaker4: we've had such a problem with bill's rich guy image, we could spin the issue to make him more 'everymen,' you know, 'crime touches everyone,' like that.
speaker2: what about a voter backlash, like how could he run on the heels of a tragedy?
speaker1: no -- we push the 'courage under adversity' angle.
speaker4: helps with his leadership profile.
speaker3: bill gluckman, crusader/martyr...
speaker4: i've got the image -- bill weeping over brad's open casket.
speaker1: then, after grieving appropriately, he goes on the offensive...

speaker1: bill gluckman's war on crime... 
speaker2: ... drugs.
speaker3: ... gangs.
speaker1: war's hot now.
speaker2: war's great.
speaker3: it's just what we've needed.
speaker1: it's like a green light to sacramento.
speaker4: next stop, the white house.

speaker1: what up? 
speaker2: no deal.
speaker1: say what?
speaker2: bill gluckman does not make deals with criminals.
speaker1: that's it, then, fool. i ain't playin'. his is done.

speaker1: that's cold. lose the tape. 
speaker2: that hurts!!! i get out of this i'ma hafta teach y'all some manners!
speaker1: your daddy ain't payin'.
speaker2: yeah, yeah, tell me somethin' i don't know!
speaker1: what?
speaker2: you heard me, you half-steppin' moist-ass
speaker2: oh what, you gonna do me like this? a'ight, then bring it.
speaker1: it's brought.
speaker2: man up! put this wannabe out of his misery.

speaker1: lay down some cover, fool! 
speaker2: we're tryin', man, but they're too strapped.
speaker3: what the we gonna do?
speaker4: punks. gimme dem gats.

speaker1: y'all wanna play? let's play! you know who you're dealin' with??? 
speaker1: i'm b-rad g, from the 'bu, y'all... king kong ain't got nothin' on me!

speaker1: this gangster, believed to be the notorious 'white kong,' leader of i-9 street gang, fires his weapons with wanton disregard for human life or personal property. 
speaker2: in slow motion as he fires.
speaker1: if you have any information on the whereabouts of this man, call our hot line at 1-555-gang.

speaker2: if dat's what you got to do to get on big boy's label, count me out.
speaker1: he ain't with big boy, fool! b- rad's hangin' with some serious bangers!
speaker3: what we gonna do, moch?

speaker2: if you cancel, you can kiss this campaign good-bye.

speaker1: you can shove the campaign up your ass, tom! i will not lose my son over this election! 
speaker2: i understand you're upset, bill, but for once in your life think outside the box! we can make brad's whole gang thing a positive...
speaker1: a positive!
speaker2: if he's arrested or, forbid injured, we spin it so you are the victim, you know, 'crime reaches everyone,' something like that...
speaker1: you're trying to get votes out of this?
speaker2: i'm trying to win, bill, and you don't seem to care!
speaker1: i'm his father.
speaker2: when did that happen?
speaker1: i guess right now.
speaker1: you're fired.
