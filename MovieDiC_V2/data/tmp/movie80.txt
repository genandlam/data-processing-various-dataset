speaker1: my daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. that's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. know why it's best to rotate em like that? 
speaker2: uh-uh.
speaker1: cuz once in a while soil need a change. corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. so next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. that give off a lot of nitrate. change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong. sting a bit?
speaker2: itches.

speaker1: well... i hope these will work for your niece. she can always come back in and swap sizes. 
speaker2: mind i ask, what's all this business here?
speaker1: these are whipped body creams. it's like a lotion.
speaker2: for your hands?
speaker1: some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. so now they have scented creams. they help moisturize a woman's skin. this one's my favorite. it's called ginger souffle. i recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. so... perhaps just after a shower.
speaker2: i'll take a jar of that, too.

speaker1: lookin' for miss angela. 
speaker2: she in the back.
speaker3: wait right there.

speaker1: if you in some trouble, than we gonna figure somethin' out. you and me. wipe your face!
speaker1: now... this got anything to do with rose? then what?

speaker1: are you outta ya mind? 
speaker2: man like you ought not take the lord's name like you just done.
speaker1: a naked woman, chained in ya house?
speaker2: i'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. i found her beat. left for dead. so i brung her home.
speaker1: laz, i know about that girl. good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know. oh, laz. she's had a mess of crabs and them std's. what'chu thinking?
speaker2: i haven't laid a hand. on my life, r.l., my wick is dry on this.
speaker1: you say she was beat on. you call the sheriff on that?
speaker2: put yo'self in my shoes. say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to i been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
speaker1: what's that chain around her for?
speaker2: why don't you go'on and ask her. she need to talk wit somebody with sense. folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. and this is how i'm handling it.

speaker1: silence. 
speaker2: go in and talk to her. please.
speaker2: good. makin' steaks for supper. i expect you to come.
speaker3: you mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
speaker2: you treat folks special when they company. it's just supper, r.l.,
speaker3: one thing at a time, laz.
speaker2: watch y'self in there. that girl'll jump on ya junk like a grasshopper.

speaker1: did i hurt'chu? 
speaker1: what happened in there... that won't your fault. ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
speaker2: why she got a chain on her?
speaker1: that's between her and me. it's private. and i don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
speaker2: please don't tell my daddy.
speaker1: my mouth is shut, boy. and that's how we gonna keep it. don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
speaker1: so... that your first time?
speaker2: yes'sir.
speaker1: you struck some gold, didn't ya?
speaker1: my first time was with my second cousin behind my uncle's barn. she weighed two tons, if a pound. could'a done a lot better for myself. you sho'nuf did.

speaker1: thank you. 
speaker2: i gotta ask you. why do you think laz is keepin' you chained like this?
speaker1: you know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
speaker2: so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is... you think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
speaker1: you a preacher?
speaker2: that's right.
speaker1: can i ask you a question? people always say, you gotta get good with if you want not to go to hell. that you say sorry for all you done and... and would let you go on to heaven.
speaker2: you could put it that way.
speaker1: but that's so stupid. i'm sorry. didn't mean to curse.
speaker2: what's on your mind?
speaker1: you can't hurt people... and then just say, i'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. why would heaven want people like that. people who... do what they want and then... switch.
speaker2: i'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me. i think folks carry on about heaven too much. like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. and folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. i can go to shoney's for that.
speaker2: there's sin in my heart. there's evil in this world. but when i got no one... i talk to i ask for strength. i ask for forgiveness. not for peace at the end of my days when there's no more life to live and no more good to do, but today. right now.
speaker2: what's your heaven? what gives you peace?
speaker1: ronnie.

speaker1: we gonna eat with her? 
speaker2: that's what i was told.
speaker1: she still gonna have that chain on?
speaker2: well... i'm working on that. so... what's goin' on in your life, lincoln?
speaker1: i ain't no virgin no more?

speaker1: now that's sharp. that is sharp. chain give you any trouble? 
speaker2: uh-uh.
speaker1: good. now i got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. r.l. and lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. what do you know how to make?
speaker2: i don't cook.
speaker1: gal, i been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. and let me tell you...
speaker2: look it... i put the dress on, didn't i? i think i'm handlin' myself with some... restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
speaker1: if all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out. rae. rae! i'm not fightin' with ya. i just know you got more in you than junk. now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all? you know how to boil water?

speaker2: sure.
speaker2: hey, herman.
speaker3: they buy you that big chicken dinner?
speaker1: what?
speaker3: they got little names for everything in the corps when they trying to get rid of ya. don't know what it's like in the guard. there's what you call a bad conduct discharge, a bcd... we all called it the big chicken dinner. it ain't the brig but it'll ya for life if you wantin' to work for the government.
speaker2: that's not what this is about.
speaker3: they got another little name called ad-sep. that sound about right?
speaker3: ad-sep. administrative separation.
speaker1: how do you get one of those?
speaker3: blowin' boys in the head, for one.
speaker3: whoa, son! i ain't sayin' about you. i'm just talkin'.
speaker2: well, you don't know what you're talking about so why don't you shut the up?
speaker1: hey, it's alright, man. it's alright. herman. come on. he just got back.
speaker3: to get back ya had to've gone somewhere.
speaker1: what happened?
speaker2: they been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. thought it was just some tic i got, or ulcers like my daddy had. i can't... shoot. target practice i'm a pro. i tag between the numbers each time but... but when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. i get shaky and... i lose my breath. they called it anxiety. severe anxiety. it can be fixed and all... just not in time for.... it's a long process but... they sent me home.
speaker1: i guess it could be worse. you could be comin' back in a body bag.
speaker2: i can't get rae on the phone. she's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
speaker1: she's around. always is.
speaker2: i don't know. she's gettin' crazy, like she gets. begged me not to go. got real down. i just think somethin's happened. like she run off with someone. you'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
speaker1: you been home yet?
speaker2: uh-uh. i's hitchin' up the interstate when i seen your truck outside.
speaker1: you need a ride?

speaker1: rae? 
speaker1: this don't feel right. kitchen looks just like i left it. i know, cuz i cleaned it.
speaker2: she ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
speaker1: i just been so mixed up lately, gill. and, you know, with her history, i can see how she could get scared... ...and run.
speaker2: drink. come on, drink some.
speaker1: her momma works down at the grocery, down on the square. maybe she seen her.
speaker2: ronnie. you can't see cuz you're too close to it. these nervous spells you get. you never had that back in school...
speaker1: that's not right, really, cuz i...
speaker2: you joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. army'd pay for school. you were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
speaker2: and then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
speaker1: now wait...
speaker2: with all she was doin'. with all the she kept doing! you stayed stuck to that bitch's and you wouldn't let go.
speaker1: i know about how she was like. but we was different. i's the only person she talked to about it. how she's abused. terrible things, gill, just terrible...

speaker1: it's not her fault, gill. she's had to take care of me all this time, cuz i'd just start throwin' up... choking. just losin' my grip. and she listened. she listened to me. and... i got better. i don't get nervous like i used to. and since we been together... she been faithful to me. put all that junk behind her... 
speaker2: the only thing that had behind her is me and half the town her. your first night away, i come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. you weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
speaker2: don't you think it's funny how i know where everything in your house is? i don't care if that hurts you or not. truth is i don't know who you are anymore. so it. gill turns away. ronnie grips gill around the neck from behind. he bends him back painfully and throws his head up against the wall.

speaker1: you gonna steal my truck? 
speaker2: make yourself at home. you done it already.

speaker1: gotta get that chain off her, laz. somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble. 
speaker2: i'm dealin' with what put before me.
speaker1: you believe he wants this? a woman chained to ya radiator?
speaker2: not like that.
speaker1: then what?
speaker2: she's tied to me, r.l.. we tied to each other.
speaker1: i can't leave unless i get your word.
speaker1: laz. i got some news you need to hear. it's about rose and your brother.
speaker3: she's pregnant. she gonna have a baby. her sister told my wife. you know how them sewing circles go. just a matter of time till you got word. thought that's why you been keepin' to yourself out here. i don't know how much of this is to make her happy or to hurt you. but it is what it is.

speaker1: black snake is evil, black snake is all i see.black snake is evil, black snake is all i see.woke up this mornin', black snake moved in on me. laz concludes the song. rae raises up to her knees, facing laz. tears have run down his dried face. he opens his eyes.
speaker1: my life is gone. only life i was livin'. and i lost it.
speaker2: i'm here with you.

speaker1: no, you do it. i can't sing.
speaker2: stop that foolishness. just do as i say and close your eyes. close your eyes. and think about... well, for a song like this, i'd say you think about what you love.

speaker2: ronnie. please, baby...
speaker1: did 'ya have fun with her? sweet as a peach, i bet. huh? huh?
speaker1: it, i ask you a question, you better answer it, or i'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
speaker2: ronnie...

speaker1: careful how you point that gun, boy. 
speaker2: or what? or what?
speaker1: boy? you here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
speaker2: ain't gonna be callin' me boy when i blow your face off.
speaker1: you sayin' you'll do what?
speaker2: you heard me, i'll kill..
speaker2: you testing me? huh? you testin' me, old man?
speaker1: test. what kind'a test you thinkin'? you mean like, if you a man or not? if you a killer? only one way to prove that. you just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
speaker1: ain't that easy, is it? i been in some scraps, son, i know. first there's that loud crack. always louder than you think. like it just come-up- a-cloud and clapped a mess thunder right in ya hand. bam!
speaker1: white light. smell of smoke. taste of my blood and brains in your mouth, stingin' ya eyes.
speaker3: oh, baby... just let me...

speaker1: put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. that's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. she'd fear ya then. cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. she with a real man now. a real killer! 
speaker2: don't... don't say that to me...
speaker1: son, i'm grown. don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. i'm too old to play house... ...and cowboys. so let's have it. end me or get out of my face! ronnie looks like a scared five year old having an asthma attack. laz barks at him one last time.
speaker1: go'on. do it.

speaker1: ronnie? 
speaker2: i can't stop... i can't stop... being scared. what am i gonna do...
speaker1: i got you, baby... i got you...
speaker1: what are you doing? you gonna call the cops? you think they gonna help this? they ever help you, laz? huh?
speaker3: laz looks at rae. there is hurt in his eyes.
speaker4: thought you knew me better, gal. i need you at my house... right now.

speaker1: i imagine there's a lot of good between you two. but i want you to tell me what's bad. go'on. and don't hold back. ronnie is very uncomfortable. he looks at rae seated next to him and then back at r.l.. 
speaker2: i hate this town. you can't round the corner without bumping into someone who's got your number. we did a lot of dreamin', me and rae. makin' plans to get out. i'd do my tour and... we'd move outta here. go to chattanooga. and i'd work for my uncle. but... when rae gets like she does. and she does the things that she always done. makes me feel like she loves this place more'n me.
speaker1: go on, ronnie.
speaker2: all my life people called me like, sissy and... nervous and... i got few things in my life that make me feel like... like...
speaker3: like a man.
