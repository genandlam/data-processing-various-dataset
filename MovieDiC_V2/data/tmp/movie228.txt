CARTER: i might have guessed.
CON: sorry about this. but there you are. orders are orders.
CARTER: and what orders would they be, con?
CON: gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
PETER: we've got to take you back to london.
CON: he said it'd be doing him a big favour.
CON: we know why you're all steamed up, and so do gerald and sid.
PETER: but they have to be diplomatic.

CARTER: how were things between you and frank? 
MARGARET: he was all right to me.
CARTER: nothing more? just another feller?
MARGARET: nicer than most.
CARTER: but he was just another feller, wasn't he?
MARGARET: yes.
CARTER: though nicer than most?
MARGARET: yes. i can't help the way i am.
CARTER: why'd you see him so regular?
MARGARET: once a week?
CARTER: i call that regular.
MARGARET: he was gentlemanly. i like that.
CARTER: once a week you like a gentleman?
MARGARET: look, i'm me, right. you're not. we are what we are, like it or not. why all the needle?
CARTER: what was bugging frank?
MARGARET: he wanted me to leave dave and marry him. last friday i told him it wouldn't work. dave would have killed us both! he followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, i had to tell frank i couldn't see him any more. it was getting too dodgy. that was on sunday. he said he'd kill himself. i was frightened what you might do.
CARTER: i don't believe you, margaret. frank wasn't like that. i'm the villain in the family, remember?
MARGARET: it's the truth.
MARGARET: it is. honestly.
CARTER: you whore. frank was too careful to die like that. who killed him?
MARGARET: i don't know nothing.
CARTER: listen, the only reason i came back to this craphole was to find out who did it. and i won't leave until i do. you understand?
CON: hello, jack.
CARTER: you it was you who told them i was here, wasn't it?
CON: peter's very upset about his car. he's going to all over you.
CARTER: i'll catch up with you later, margaret.
PETER: come on, get in.

GLENDA: you didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you? 
CARTER: no. i didn't know that.
GLENDA: a fairy godmother, all of your own. aren't you lucky?
CARTER: so where are we going, princess?
GLENDA: to the demon king's castle, of course.
CARTER: of course. where else?

CARTER: how'd you know where i'd be? 
GLENDA: you were seen parking your car. the demon king waves his wand and i was dispatched to bring you to him. lucky for you i waited.
CARTER: very lucky, i should think. you're drunk!
GLENDA: nasty.
CARTER: he must have been pretty sure i'd come.
GLENDA: oh, he was. he told me a magic spell that would make you come.
CARTER: and what was that?
GLENDA: we're there now.

BRUMBY: a new venture of mine. it's going to be a restaurant. do you like it? 
CARTER: yes.
BRUMBY: last night, after you'd gone, i did a little bit of asking around. seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, it seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? i got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke i wanted off my back, you know my life. machines. the arcades. nice business. looks after itself. people put money in. i take it out. not much rough stuff. it's a business that makes me very happy. but recently, i've had a spot of bother, one of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. the upshot is i've had to eat and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. so far as i'm concerned, that's it. apparently not. these people i've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, so i'm worried. i can't fight them â— i haven't that kind of set-up. but i've got to fix them before they fix me. trouble is, if i try and they find out, i'm dead.
BRUMBY: five grand. it belongs to you. along with a little name i'm going to give you.
CARTER: what name?
BRUMBY: kinnear. cyril kinnear. kinnear did it.
CARTER: why?
BRUMBY: i don't know. all i know is that people were bricks up at his place last saturday. your brother's name was mentioned. next day, he was dead.
CARTER: why?
BRUMBY: i don't know. that's all i was told.
CARTER: that's not good enough.
BRUMBY: christ, what...
CARTER: do me a favour. you don't really expect me to fix kinnear on your say-so? just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. stroll on.
BRUMBY: jack, you're wrong.
CARTER: good afternoon, mr brumby. carter exits.
BRUMBY: jack...

CARTER: who's setting you up in this place? 
GLENDA: brumby.
CARTER: is he coming here?
GLENDA: don't worry. he's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
CARTER: aren't you scared kinnear will find out?
GLENDA: he won't. he thinks i'm simple.
