HAP: just look at all that. 
WILL: i don't need to look at it.

HAP: nothing wrong with smelling the roses. 
WILL: tell that to her, partner.

OLD MAN: eleanor? 
ELLIE: hey, mr. angstrom!
MR. ANGSTROM: what're you doing here?
ELLIE: police business.
MR. ANGSTROM: police business? the old man screws up his face, confused. mr. angstrom didn't you used to baby-sit for us?
ELLIE: i don't babysit any more, mr. angstrom. just made detective three weeks ago.
MR. ANGSTROM: boy, charlie must be short-handed down at the station.
WILL: "halibut fishing capital of the world." hap, right behind him. rubs his neck.
HAP: this ought to be interesting.
ELLIE: detective dormer!
WILL: my partner...
ELLIE: detective eckhart! i know! welcome to nightmute!
ELLIE: i just want to say how incredible it is to have you working with us, detective dormer. i've followed all your cases. theodore dineli, frank and casey prud'homme, the port angeles shootings...

ELLIE: sure thing, spence. 
WILL: you did your homework, officer.
ELLIE: actually...
ELLIE: i just made detective three weeks ago.

CHIEF NYBACK: i'll be damned! 
WILL: how you doing, charlie?
HAP: hey, charlie.
CHIEF NYBACK: christ. i haven't seen you boys since...
WILL: just after leland street.
CHIEF NYBACK: what's that, then?
HAP: eight years.
WILL: seven years.
CHIEF NYBACK: seven years? where does it all go? that was some amazing time, though, wasn't it? looks at will. down at his boots. chief nyback you haven't changed a bit, will.
WILL: you have, chief.
CHIEF NYBACK: i knew that was coming. i deserve it.
ELLIE: yes, sir.
CHIEF NYBACK: that's all, for now.
ELLIE: oh. right. okay.
WILL: nice kid.
CHIEF NYBACK: got a love affair with police work. drives me crazy with it.
WILL: keeping you busy up here, charlie?
HAP: "2nd prize great kodiak salmon catch."
CHIEF NYBACK: i told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement.
WILL: so far.
CHIEF NYBACK: what's the d.a. got them on?
WILL: four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
CHIEF NYBACK: how about you? how you faring?
HAP: they're all over us, charlie.
WILL: they're all over everybody.
HAP: i.a.'s calling themselves the "corruption task force." can you believe that? trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other detectives may have made over the years. they're turning it into a witch hunt. something on the news about it practically every night.
CHIEF NYBACK: got a bunch of messages here from some guy named warfield.
WILL: that's i.a.'s pit bull.
CHIEF NYBACK: wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.

CHIEF NYBACK: this is detective dormer and his partner detective eckhart. on loan from buck lundgard, seattle robbery and homicide special branch. they'll be helping with the connell case. 
FRED: helping?
CHIEF NYBACK: anything they need to see, you show them; anywhere they want to go, you take them. this is detective fred duggar. he's been leading the investigation up to now.
WILL: detective...
FRED: suppose you want to see the body.

FRED: we can walk from here. 
WILL: guess that's what they call alaskan hospitality.
ELLIE: don't worry about him...
FRED: ellie! go type something!

CORONER: did a fundascopic examination and found papilledema and petechiae of the retina. 
HAP: beaten to death.
CORONER: beaten to death.
WILL: what about these contusions?
CORONER: superficial.
WILL: any signs of rape?
CORONER: none.
WILL: wait.
FRED: no.

WILL: no fibers, skin flakes, hairs... 
FRED: like i said, no. we know about those things up here.
WILL: he knew exactly what we'd be looking for. made sure to cover up all his tracks.
HAP: even the best make mistakes.

RACHEL: lower forty-eight. 
HAP: lower forty-eight?
RACHEL: you're not from here. i can tell by your walk.
HAP: oh? and how's that?
RACHEL: unsure.
WILL: detectives will dormer and hap eckhart. there should be a reservation for us.
RACHEL: your friend's all business.
WILL: i'm always all business.
RACHEL: alaskan summers. hope you're an easy sleeper. it'll be like this all night. she hands them two cards. rachel sign here.

HAP: me. 
WILL: come on in.
HAP: see you have the same decor as my room.
WILL: what do you want to talk about?
HAP: you know what about.
WILL: we'll talk when we get back to seattle.
HAP: when's that, a week? two weeks?... we have to figure out a plan of action now.
WILL: you know my plan of action.
HAP: to do nothing.
WILL: that's right.
HAP: dammit, will. warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday. five hours. asking all kinds of questions...
WILL: he's asking everybody questions.
HAP: but he's zeroing in on me. on us.
WILL: he's just rattling your cage.
HAP: well, i gotta tell you. with a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
WILL: we say nothing. it goes away. simple as that.
HAP: look. we've tampered with evidence. we've pushed witnesses. we've planted and they're sniffing around like dogs. especially on the dobbs case...
WILL: weston dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat. you remember that?
HAP: you know i remember that.
WILL: one word to i.a. and he walks.
HAP: maybe not. we could talk to buck...
WILL: no way.
HAP: cut some kind of a deal. i heard that's what flynn's doing...
WILL: mike flynn's a dirty cop, hap! we are nothing like mike flynn. we did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- dobbs paid for what he did. and every like him. we say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk. every last one. and i am not going to let that happen. no deals. no compromises. no discussions.
HAP: goddammit, will. you grab on to something and you don't let it go.
HAP: i don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else. i can't tell any more. but i can tell you one thing. i'm getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff. breaking the rules. cleaning up messes. we're a dying breed, will. you're a dying breed. i.a., the d.a., all those reporters - they don't care what you did at leland street seven years ago. they don't care that you've made this your life. they don't care about getting the bad guy...
WILL: i care.

ELLIE: brought you a bear claw. just in case you were hungry. will takes the bag. looks inside. yikes. ellie local delicacy. 
WILL: think i'll pass.
ELLIE: oh. you know. small-time stuff.
WILL: don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
ELLIE: but they're so boring. all small stuff.
WILL: it's all about the small stuff. small lies. small mistakes. small oversights. people give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case. it's human nature. he looks over. ellie's listening intently. will aren't you going to write that down?
ELLIE: let me just...

WILL: typical seventeen year-old. she went to a party friday night? 
ELLIE: down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
WILL: no diary.
FRED: she left the party early. friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
WILL: what time was that?
FRED: around twelve-thirty.
WILL: who was the last one to see her alive?
FRED: randy stetz. her boyfriend. we've questioned him, searched his place. didn't find anything.
WILL: these are designer. expensive. could randy stetz afford these?
ELLIE: he fixes boat engines.
WILL: well her mother didn't buy them for her.
HAP: what are we thinking?
WILL: kay connell had an admirer.
WILL: you don't seem all that sad.
RANDY: i haven't had a chance! you been all over my back since monday!
HAP: you know smoking stunts your growth.
RANDY: yeah, okay, fat-ass.
HAP: more alaskan hospitality.
WILL: did you love her?
RANDY: huh?
WILL: kay connell. did you love her?
RANDY: sure. she was nice.
WILL: "she was nice." wow. that makes me all soft inside. ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
RANDY: huh?
WILL: you heard me that time.
RANDY: she loved me. she wanted to see me every night.
WILL: but she was seeing someone else on the side.
RANDY: i don't know what you're talking about.
WILL: friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
RANDY: stuff.
WILL: what kind of stuff?
RANDY: just stuff. i don't remember.
WILL: the other guy?
RANDY: i told you i don't remember.
WILL: after that she left the party to go to him.
RANDY: how should i know?...
WILL: ran like to go to him...
RANDY: you, man! - i'm sick of all your cop questions...
WILL: now you listen to me, you little this fuck-the-world-metallica-t-shirt may work with your mamma, but it doesn't work with me. you got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else. you want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is?
RANDY: i don't know.
WILL: you don't know.
RANDY: she didn't tell me.

ELLIE: he's a little surly, isn't he? 
WILL: just a little.
WILL: i want you to check this out, ellie.
ELLIE: we already did.
WILL: do it again.
ELLIE: but there wasn't any...
WILL: the small things - remember? the second you're about to dismiss something - look at it again.
ELLIE: you want me to write that down?
WILL: who's that?
ELLIE: the bartender at darrow's. he was there friday night.
WILL: good. he's up next.

WILL: halibut calabrese. halibut olympia. halibut cajun style. halibut fish and chips... he puts down his menu. reaches for his drink. will can't wait to see what's for dessert. 
HAP: at least there's variety.
WILL: looks like the natives are restless.
HAP: will?
HAP: i wish i could stick it out like you. i just, with trish and the kids...
WILL: don't do this, hap...
HAP: i'm thinking i could get off with probation. keep half my pension. that's all i want.
WILL: goddammit, hap. think about what you're doing...
HAP: you don't have to be involved, will.
WILL: you tell buck and i'm involved whether i like it or not...
RACHEL: ready to order?
HAP: hey - you do everything around here?
RACHEL: just about.
WILL: i'll just have another scotch in my room. if you don't mind. just then, his cell phone rings.
WILL: where is it?
ELLIE: over here.
WILL: we're sure it's hers?
FRED: has her books in it.
HAP: what about prints?
WILL: biology and algebra.
FARRELL: i read that kind of crap.
WILL: read them. tell me anything that strikes you.
FRED: i'll stick it in the evidence locker...
WILL: no.

FARRELL: uh, right. about two miles outside of town. 
ELLIE: on the beach.
FRED: why are we taking it back?
WILL: this murder was in the papers, right?
ELLIE: yeah. all over.
WILL: call all of them from here to anchorage. tell them we now know that kay connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet. we can get it in by the morning editions. he hands the bag to farrell. will fill this with random books. make it look heavy.
HAP: nice. lighter than i remembered.
FARRELL: glock 40. all plastic save the barrel and firing pin. never rusts. what do you carry down in seattle?
HAP: smith and wesson 45.
FARRELL: excellent!
ELLIE: brought some coffee...
FRED: what are you doing here?
WILL: i told her to come.
ELLIE: anything yet?
FARRELL: maybe this guy doesn't read the papers.
HAP: or goes straight to the sports section.
FRED: i see someone!
WILL: that's him.
WILL: will fan out.
ELLIE: but...
FRED: he's bolting!
WILL: go! go! go!

FARRELL: sorry about... 
WILL: where is he? farrell can't answer that. will where'd the shot come from?
FARRELL: over there.
SUDDENLY: a dark figure
WILL: freeze!

WILL: hap! 
FRED: dormer...

CHIEF NYBACK: and then you lost him. 
WILL: and then i lost him. in the fog.
CHIEF NYBACK: about how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
WILL: twenty, thirty seconds. i followed the sound down to the water. that's where... he blinks. looks down. swallows. will that's where i found hap.
CHIEF NYBACK: i think you need a glass of this.
WILL: why didn't i know about that tunnel, charlie?
CHIEF NYBACK: there's a bunch of those tunnels out there, will. from bunkers over sixty years old. i don't even know half of them myself, and i grew up here.
WILL: i had him, charlie. right in front of me. not two feet. i could smell the son- of-a-bitch. playing with me. and i missed the shot. he was right there and i missed the shot! then my gun jammed...
CHIEF NYBACK: will, you can't blame yourself.
WILL: i had him!
CHIEF NYBACK: it's only gonna make you crazy.
ELLIE: you wanted to see me?
CHIEF NYBACK: right, ellie.
ELLIE: but what about the connell case? i'm on the connell case.
CHIEF NYBACK: we need paperwork, ellie. you know that. just write up a quick report.
WILL: i'm going to check on the roadblocks...
CHIEF NYBACK: you're no good right now, will. go back to the lodge. try to get some rest.

RADIO: ...earlier this evening after an aborted attempt to apprehend a suspect. he was forty-five... 
RACHEL: i'm sorry about your partner.
WILL: you were nice to him. he liked you.
RACHEL: pioneer lodge?...
WILL: dormer.
WARFIELD'S VOICE: detective dormer. i've been trying to reach you. i was very sorry to hear about your partner, detective eckhart. it must have been a terrible shock, what happened this morning.
WILL: that's not exactly how i'd put it. warfield's voice no, no. i suppose not. but i look forward to reading the report. very sad. very sad. funny...
WILL: what do you mean, "funny?"
WARFIELD'S VOICE: oh, nothing. just that i felt detective eckhart and i, hap and i, were starting to make a real connection before you left. i sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest. did you sense anything like that, detective? i mean, as his partner?...
WILL: you know why everyone hates you, warfield? it's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you the marrow out of real cops when you never had the to become one yourself. well i got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because i'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of. you just remember that when you're sitting at your desk reading your report on my dead partner! slam! he hangs up the phone. runs his hand through his hair. turns back to rachel. will next time. go ahead and lie.

HAP'S REFLECTION: looming behind him. 
HAP: they're watching us, will...
WILL: hap!

CHIEF NYBACK: ...nightmute hasn't lost an officer in thirty-seven years, and even though detective eckhart wasn't from here, he was as good as one of us on this case. i had the honor of working with him down in seattle for a number of years. he was a fine detective and an even better man. 
CHIEF NYBACK: okay. then let's get to it.
ELLIE: detective dormer?
WILL: it's good to be accurate, ellie. you're doing your job.
ELLIE: i'm so sorry about what happened. i know you did everything you could... will points to a spot. cutting her off.
WILL: i was here.
FRED: dormer. still no sign of the bullet that went through farrell.
WILL: i'm going to the hospital to talk to him now. you get the search party together. no fewer than thirty people. i'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes. don't waste any time.
FRED: partner or no partner. that guy's a prick.
ELLIE: he has to be a prick, fred. he's a great detective.

FARRELL: detective dormer! 
WILL: i'm not. he pulls up a chair. nods to the paperback. will how's the book?
FARRELL: oh, a real tear-jerker. brody, the good guy, just got shot.
WILL: thanks.
FARRELL: i wish i'd had the chance to get to know him better. take him fishing or something.
WILL: he would have liked that.
FARRELL: we just gotta catch the bastard, right?
WILL: that's why i'm here. i need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, farrell.
FARRELL: what i saw?
WILL: anything. it's important.
FARRELL: pretty much nothing. that fog was so thick. the bullet seemed to come out of nowhere. i don't even remember seeing any shapes. then i saw you. but only when you came up close. then you disappeared again. i guess i heard more than i saw. will sighs, rubs his eyes. farrell sorry.
WILL: no. no. don't be sorry. it's not your fault.
NURSE: time for your meds.
FARRELL: lonnie and i went to high school together.
LONNIE: just take the pills, farrell.
WILL: how's the leg?
FARRELL: oh, you know. don't feel that much.
WILL: right. got lost in the rocks.
FARRELL: we'll get the other one, though.

ELLIE: ...and it was at this point that detective dormer headed towards the noise... 
FRANCIS: what?
ELLIE: you're supposed to be farrell. shot in the thigh and writhing in pain.
FRANCIS: c'mon, ellie. what's it matter?
ELLIE: accuracy. that's what. now get down.
FRANCIS: ow.

VOICE: yeah. and i'm freezing my nads off! ellie furrows her brow. just then... 
FRANCIS: ellie! think i found something!

VOICE: detective? 
BURLY GUY #1: where do you want us?
WILL: the woods. one group heading south, the other heading north.

FRED: make sure they're set to channel 6... 
OFFICER #1: we did the interviews with all the nearby houses like you asked.
WILL: anything?
OFFICER #1: here's a list of who we talked to.
WILL: alright. go back and set up some follow- ups for this afternoon.
FRED: you don't think they should start further back? will shakes his head.
WILL: he had to have exited here. over those boulders. i saw him move, he's nimble. would have taken the hardest way out.
FRED: duggar...

RACHEL: here. it's on the house. 
WILL: thanks.
RACHEL: i got it. don't know why i bother. it's been broken for two years.
WILL: habit.
WILL: fred duggar?
RACHEL: no. he didn't say what his name was.
WILL: i'm not expecting anyone.
RACHEL: that's not what he thinks.
WILL: what did he look like?
RACHEL: short. dark hair. not that memorable.
WILL: i need to borrow something.

WILL: i could say the same thing about you. 
ELLIE: oh. we always have play-offs in the middle of the night. it's the best time.
WILL: who's playing?
ELLIE: the puffins and the hawks. we're in extra innings. the hawks have a really good line-up this year.
ELLIE: that's my sister.
WILL: she your only sibling?
WILL: no. well. i had a brother. he died when i was eleven.
ELLIE: oh, i shouldn't have...
WILL: it's okay. happened a long time ago. he was killed in a fire. in new mexico.
ELLIE: that must have been awful for you.
WILL: not really. i remember i was more embarrassed that he had died. embarrassed that it made me different. so i didn't tell the other kids at school what had happened. they'd ask me where he was, where he'd gone. and i'd make up stories. he was visiting an aunt up north, he'd broken his leg, he was in a swiss boarding school. stuff like that. nice kid, huh? just kept making up more and more lies... suddenly, he stops talking. slowly sits up. sensing something. ellie, noticing the shift.
ELLIE: you okay?

WILL: i'm going back to the lodge, ellie. still need to go through some of kay connell's school records. 
ELLIE: okay.

WILL: officer!... 
WILL: i'll pick it up. you head back to the station.

CORONER: detective. thought you were sending one of your lackeys. 
WILL: i thought it was better if i came. under the circumstances. the coroner nods. goes to wash her hands.
CORONER: it's different when you know them, isn't it? just sign over there and she's all yours.
CORONER: your partner didn't suffer much...
WILL: thanks, doc.
CORONER: you're looking a little green, detective.

WILL: what's with all the moose antlers around here? 
FRED: lots of moose.

MAN'S VOICE: you lower-48s. you think the white nights are kind of neat. then you can't sleep for days. i've seen it happen about a million times. but you can't sleep for a different reason.
WILL: who is this?
WILL: i said, who is this?
MAN'S VOICE: i saw what really happened, will...
MAN'S VOICE: i saw you kill your partner. with your back-up weapon. out there on the beach.

WILL: now you listen to me...
MAN'S VOICE: don't worry. i won't tell anyone. oh, and i saw you take my gun. my uncle's old 357. i dropped it in the rocks. but you can go ahead and keep that.

ELLIE: detective dormer! 
ELLIE: you look like you're in a hurry. i just wanted to ask you about these pictures.
WILL: right.
ELLIE: but here's the thing. i retraced your exact steps according to your statement. you couldn't have seen detective eckhart from there. i mean, not in that fog.
WILL: then change it.

WILL: not really.
ELLIE: isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop? a good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing. a bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him. you said that once, remember? will, finally looks at her.
WILL: no. but it sounds like something i would've said. turns and starts up the steps. will see you tomorrow, ellie.
ELLIE: oh! i forgot to tell you. the puffins won.

WILL: listen to me, you 
RECORDED VOICE: ...i saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him...
WILL: goddammit, byrd!
WALTER: you'd have done the same thing, will. i know you would... he hangs up.

RACHEL: will...i... 
WILL: what is it?
RACHEL: there's a guy down the hall. complaining about the noise. says he can't sleep.

RACHEL: are you alright? 
WILL: i'm fine.
RACHEL: did something happen?
WILL: no.
RACHEL: will...
WILL: the light. it keeps coming in...
RACHEL: will.

WILL: there was this guy named weston dobbs. twenty-four. worked as a part-time stock boy in a copy store. every morning he'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year-old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street. and every afternoon he'd watch the boy get dropped off again. he did this for about six months. until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came. kept him in his apartment for three days. tortured him. raped him. made him do things... 
RACHEL: one of your cases?
WILL: me and hap. a year and a half ago. i knew the second i met dobbs that he was guilty. smug, cold. dead eyes. we had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it. nothing concrete. went over every inch of that apartment.
RACHEL: what happened?
WILL: we took some blood samples from the boy's body and planted them in his apartment. arrested him the next day.
RACHEL: will.
WILL: there've been other cases. where we've changed results. pushed witnesses. manipulated evidence. but dobbs. i wanted dobbs more than anything.
RACHEL: what if someone finds out?
WILL: we're under investigation now. back in seattle. hap wanted to talk. as soon as we got back. thought he could work out some kind of deal.
RACHEL: well, that's not going to happen now.
WILL: do you think it was wrong? what we did?
RACHEL: there are two kinds of people in alaska. those who were born here and those who've come here to escape something in their lives. i wasn't born here, will. i'm in no position to judge anyone. i'm not about that any more. looks out the window. rachel it's all about what you're willing to live with.

FRED: in what manner? 
WALTER: she was, not quite a "fan." more an avid reader of my detective novels.
ELLIE: when did you first meet her?
WALTER: a year ago. at one of my signings.
FRED: where you signed this?
WALTER: that's right.
FRED: what happened at that signing?
WALTER: she flattered me about my writing. asked if she could visit me. to talk about my books.
FRED: did she?
WALTER: yes. not that much at first. but then she became more comfortable. started visiting me every week...

FRED: mr. byrd. anything you can tell us could help out with this case.
WALTER: well. he hit her.
FRED: are you sure about that?
WALTER: she'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night. bruises all over her back, her upper arms. i pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it. wanted to keep it a secret.
ELLIE: randy stetz beat kay connell?
FRED: ellie.
WALTER: he has a terrible rage. kay even said he carried a handgun around with him. fred stands. this is big. calls out the door.
FRED: margaret! get judge biggs on the phone! i'll get another warrant for stetz's place.
WALTER: could i have some more coffee, detective burr?

RANDY: you can't do this! 
RANDY: hey! i'm working on that!
OFFICER: found something.
RANDY: what the is that!
FRED: that's it. let's bag it.

RANDY: i swear to i didn't kill her. i swear to

FRANCIS: you lose all sense of time.
FARRELL: better than fred's home town.

ELLIE'S DAD: ellie? you okay?
ELLIE: where's all my academy stuff?

WILL: randy stetz is in jail.
WALTER: told you i could write an ending.
WILL: congratulations. will holds out his hand. will the tape.
WALTER: i thought maybe we could talk some more.

WILL: procedure went out the window a long time ago. walter looks at him.
WALTER: we're on the same side, will. you know that. after what we've been through together. we're partners. bound by a secret.
WILL: that's where you're wrong, walter. slowly reaches into his jacket... will there is no secret. because the biggest difference between you and me is what we will or will not live with...
WALTER: will...

WALTER: wild card.
