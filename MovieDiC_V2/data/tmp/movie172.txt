SAL: i didn't think so.
PINO: pop, what else can i say? i don't wanna be here, they don't want us here. we should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in bensonhurst.
SAL: so what if this is a black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority. i've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none. this is america. sal's famous pizzeria is here for good. you think you know it all? well, you don't. i'm your father, you better remember that.
