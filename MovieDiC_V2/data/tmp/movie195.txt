RECEPTIONIST: oh, hi. 
OLD WOMAN: hi, i was in the neighborhood and thought i'd see --
RECEPTIONIST: i think he's in a conference.
OLD WOMAN: would you just try him? you never know.
RECEPTIONIST: of course. please have a seat.
OLD WOMAN: this book -- it's essential that people read it because -- -- it's the truth. and only i know it.
RECEPTIONIST: maybe after the holidays then.

MARY: may i help you? 
CLEMENTINE: yeah, hi, i have a one o'clock with dr.
MARY: yes, please have a seat. he'll be right with you.

MIERZWIAK: yes? 
MARY: howard, your one o'clock.
MIERZWIAK: mary...
MARY: yes?
MIERZWIAK: order me a pastrami for after?
MARY: cole slaw, ice tea?
MIERZWIAK: thanks.
MARY: welcome, howard.
STAN: boo.
MARY: hi.
STAN: barely seen you all morning, kiddo.
MARY: stan... c'mon...
STAN: sorry. i just --
MARY: it's just...y'know... i mean...
STAN: i know. anyway --
MARY: anyway, i've got to do my tap dance here.
STAN: see you later, alligator.
MARY: 'kay.
STAN: hey, if you're ordering lunch for mierzwiak, would you --
MARY: i better do this, stan.
MARY: ms. kruczynski?
CLEMENTINE: hi.
MARY: how are you today?
CLEMENTINE: okay, i guess.
MARY: here we are.
MIERZWIAK: ms. kruczynski, please come in.

MIERZWIAK: how are you today? 
CLEMENTINE: okay, i guess.
MIERZWIAK: well, why don't you tell me what's going on? do you mind if i turn this on?
CLEMENTINE: i don't care.
CLEMENTINE: well, i've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, i guess.
MIERZWIAK: you guess he's your boyfriend? or you guess you're having a bad time with hm?
CLEMENTINE: what? no. i don't like the term boyfriend. it's so gay.
CLEMENTINE: maybe gay isn't the right word. but, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the he is. heheh. my significant other... heh heh. and i guess on a certain level, i want to break it off, but i feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. do i end it? should i give it more time? i'm not happy, but what do i expect? relationships require work. you know the drill. the thing that i keep coming back to is, i'm not getting any younger, i want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? so then i think i should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- i mean, he's a good guy. it's not really settling. then i think maybe i'm just a victim of movies, y'know? that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. but then i think, no, this is what i really want, so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and find it. you know? agreed? but then i think he is a good guy and...
MIERZWIAK: i think i know. i think we can help. why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. everything you can think of. everything about him. everything about you. and we'll take it from there. she nods, thinks.
CLEMENTINE: um, well, he's a tidy one --

JOEL: january 13th, 2006. today i skipped work and took the train out to montauk. it's cold. the sky is gray. i don't know what else to say. nothing happens. nothing changes. i saw naomi last night. we had sex. it was weird to fall into our old familiar life so easily. like no time has passed. after two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again. i guess that's good. 
JOEL: if i'm constitutionally incapable of making eye-contact with a woman i don't know. i guess i'd better get back to naomi.

WAITRESS: coffee? 
CLEMENTINE: yes. you've saved my life!
WAITRESS: you know what you want yet?
CLEMENTINE: ain't that the question of the century.
CLEMENTINE: you got grilled cheese and tomato soup?
WAITRESS: yeah. we're having a run on it.

CLEMENTINE: hi! 
JOEL: i'm sorry.
CLEMENTINE: why?
JOEL: why what?
CLEMENTINE: why are you sorry? i just said hi.
JOEL: no, i didn't know if you were talking to me, so... she looks around the empty car.
CLEMENTINE: really?
JOEL: well, i didn't want to assume.
CLEMENTINE: aw, c'mon, live dangerously. take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
JOEL: anyway. sorry. hi.
CLEMENTINE: it's okay if i sit closer? so i don't have to scream. not that i don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. but i don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
JOEL: no, i mean, i don't know. i can't really think of much to say probably.
CLEMENTINE: oh. so...
JOEL: i mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. i didn't mean to --
CLEMENTINE: no, i don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
JOEL: it's okay, really.
CLEMENTINE: just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. i have a long trip ahead of me. how far are you going? on the train, i mean, of course.
JOEL: rockville center.
CLEMENTINE: get out! me too! what are the odds?
JOEL: the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you. i thought that earlier in the diner. that's why i was looking at you. you work at borders, right?
CLEMENTINE: ucch, really? you're kidding. bizarre small world, huh? yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
JOEL: really? because --
CLEMENTINE: is it five years? i gotta quit right now.
JOEL: -- because i go there all the time. i don't think i ever saw you before.
CLEMENTINE: well, i'm there. i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. you have a cell phone? i need to quit right this minute. i'll call in dead.
JOEL: i don't have one.
CLEMENTINE: i'll go on the dole. like my daddy before me.
JOEL: i noticed your hair. i guess it made an impression on me, that's why i was pretty sure i recognized you.
CLEMENTINE: ah, the hair. blue, right? it's called blue ruin. the color. snappy name, huh?
JOEL: i like it.
CLEMENTINE: blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
JOEL: yeah. tom waits says it in --
CLEMENTINE: exactly! tom waits. which song?
JOEL: i can't remember.
CLEMENTINE: anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. red menace, yellow fever, green revolution. that'd be a job, coming up with those names. how do you get a job like that?
JOEL: i don't really know how --
CLEMENTINE: purple haze, pink eraser.
JOEL: you think that could possibly be a full time job? how many hair colors could there be?
CLEMENTINE: someone's got that job. agent orange! i came up with that one. anyway, there are endless color possibilities and i'd be great at it.
JOEL: i'm sure you would.
CLEMENTINE: my writing career! your hair written by clementine kruczynski. the tom waits album is rain dogs.
JOEL: you sure? that doesn't sound --
CLEMENTINE: i think. anyway, i've tried all their colors. more than once. i'm getting too old for this. but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality.
JOEL: oh, i doubt that's the case.
CLEMENTINE: well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
JOEL: sorry. i was just trying to be nice.
CLEMENTINE: yeah, i got it.
CLEMENTINE: my name's clementine, by the way.
JOEL: i'm joel.
CLEMENTINE: no jokes about my name? oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
JOEL: i don't know any jokes about your name.
CLEMENTINE: huckleberry hound?
JOEL: i don't know what that means.
CLEMENTINE: huckleberry hound! what, are you nuts?
JOEL: i'm nut nuts.
CLEMENTINE: oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' clementine? no?
JOEL: sorry. it's a pretty name, though. it means "merciful", right?
CLEMENTINE: yeah. although it hardly fits. i'm a vindictive little truth be told.
JOEL: see, i wouldn't think that about you.
CLEMENTINE: why wouldn't you think that about me?
JOEL: oh. i don't know. i was just... i don't know. i was... you seemed nice, so --
CLEMENTINE: now i'm nice? don't you know any other adjectives? there's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative...
JOEL: well, anyway... sorry.
CLEMENTINE: i just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be.
CONDUCTOR: tickets.
CLEMENTINE: what is nice, anyway? i mean, besides an adjective? i guess it can be an adverb, sort of.
CLEMENTINE: it doesn't reveal anything. nice is pandering. cowardly.
CLEMENTINE: and life is more interesting than that. or should be. i hope it is... someday. i know it's here.
CLEMENTINE: i don't need nice. i don't need myself to be it and i don't need anyone else to be it at me.
JOEL: okay.
CLEMENTINE: i know it's here. hold on.
CLEMENTINE: it. it! oh. here.
CONDUCTOR: next stop southampton.
CLEMENTINE: joel? it's joel, right?
JOEL: yes?
CLEMENTINE: i'm sorry i... yelled at you. was it yelling? i can't really tell. whatever, i'm a little out of sorts today.
JOEL: that's okay.
CLEMENTINE: my embarrassing admission is i really like that you're nice. right now, anyway. i can't tell from one moment to the next what i'm going to like. but right now i'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. that was nice of you.
JOEL: it's no problem. anyway, i have some stuff i need to --
CLEMENTINE: oh, okay. well, sure, i'll just... take care, then.
JOEL: probably see you at the book store.
CLEMENTINE: unless i get that hair-color-naming job.

JOEL: hi. i could give you a ride if you need. 
CLEMENTINE: no, that's okay. thanks, though.
JOEL: you're sure? it's cold.
CLEMENTINE: i don't want to take you out of your way.
JOEL: it's okay.
CLEMENTINE: yeah?
JOEL: where do you live?
CLEMENTINE: you're not a stalker or anything, right?
JOEL: well, i probably wouldn't say if i were, but no.
CLEMENTINE: you can't be too careful. i've been stalked. i've been told i'm highly stalkable. i don't need that.
JOEL: i'm not a stalker.
CLEMENTINE: you know wilmont?
JOEL: yeah.
CLEMENTINE: wilmont. near the high school.
CLEMENTINE: look, i'm very sorry i came off sort of nutso. i'm not really.
JOEL: it's okay. i didn't think you were.
CLEMENTINE: so you like bookstores, huh?
JOEL: i like to read.
CLEMENTINE: me too. it is rain dogs, by the way.
JOEL: yeah? i can't remember that album very well. i remember liking it. but --
CLEMENTINE: the song's 9th and hennepin. i spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/and you spill out/over the side to anyone who'll listen." remember?
JOEL: sort of, um...
CLEMENTINE: remember? "and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/and i'm lost in the window/i hide on the stairway/i hang in the curtain/i sleep in your hat..." oh, i'm so stupid. sorry.
JOEL: what?
CLEMENTINE: i'm just a bit of a wreck. "i sleep in your hat" makes me cry. me.
CLEMENTINE: thanks very much. that was very nice of you.
JOEL: well, i wouldn't want to be --
CLEMENTINE: oh, geez, i'm full of i already told you that. anyway. see ya.
JOEL: take care.
CLEMENTINE: hey, do you want to have a drink? i have lots of drinks. and i could --
JOEL: um --
CLEMENTINE: never mind. sorry, that was stupid. i'm embarrassed. good night, joel.

CLEMENTINE: thanks. i like it, too. been here about four years. it's really cheap. my downstairs neighbor is old so she's quiet, which is great. and the landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but great, and i have a little porch in the back, which is great, because i can read there, and listen to my crickets and... 
CLEMENTINE: two blue ruins...
CLEMENTINE: you like that?
JOEL: very much.
CLEMENTINE: this... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. i like it, too. i like crows. i think i used to be a crow.
JOEL: thanks. that was good, that crow sound.
CLEMENTINE: do you believe in that stuff?
JOEL: i don't know.
CLEMENTINE: me neither. oh, there's an inscription on the back. the way a crow/shook down on me/the dust of snow/from a hemlock tree/has given my heart/a change of mood/and saved some part/of a day i rued.
JOEL: frost?
CLEMENTINE: yeah. i'm not, like, a robert frost lover by any stretch. his stuff seems strictly grade school to me. but this made me cry for some reason. maybe because it is grade school. y'know?
JOEL: it's pretty.
CLEMENTINE: i miss grade school. i don't know why i'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. when i went we called it elementary school. but i like grade school better. sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. i'd like to be from then. everyone wore hats. anyway, cheers!
JOEL: cheers.
CLEMENTINE: that feels so good. take yours off.
JOEL: i'm fine.
CLEMENTINE: yeah? well, have a seat, anyway.
CLEMENTINE: ready for another?
JOEL: no, i'm okay for now.
CLEMENTINE: well, i'm ready. put some music on.
JOEL: what do you want to hear?
CLEMENTINE: you pick it.
JOEL: you just say. i'm not really --
CLEMENTINE: i don't know! i can't see them from here, joel! just pick something good.
CLEMENTINE: oh, excellent choice.
CLEMENTINE: mmmmmmm. way to go, joel. you pick good.
JOEL: well, i should probably get going.
CLEMENTINE: no, stay. just for a little while. refill?
JOEL: no. i --
CLEMENTINE: i know a man who needs a refill.
CLEMENTINE: bless alcohol, is what i say. where would i be without it. oh, mary, and joseph, maybe i don't want to think about that.
JOEL: thanks.
CLEMENTINE: drink up, young man. it'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
CLEMENTINE: i'm just kidding. c'mon.
CLEMENTINE: y'know, i'm sort of psychic.
JOEL: yeah?
CLEMENTINE: well, i go to a psychic and she's always telling me i'm psychic. she should know. do you believe in that stuff?
JOEL: i don't know.
CLEMENTINE: me neither. but sometimes i have premonitions, so, i don't know. maybe that's just coincidence. right? y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? y'know?
JOEL: yeah, i don't know. it's hard to know.
CLEMENTINE: exactly. exactly! that's exactly my feeling about it. it's hard to know. like, okay, but how many times do i think something and it doesn't happen? that's what you're saying, right? you forget about those times. right?
JOEL: yeah, i guess.
CLEMENTINE: but i think i am. i like to think i am.
CLEMENTINE: it's helpful to think there's some order to things. you're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
JOEL: sorry. my life isn't that interesting. i go to work. i go home. i don't know what to say.
CLEMENTINE: oh. does that make you sad? or anxious? i'm always anxious thinking i'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? taking advantage of every possibility? just making sure that i'm not wasting one second of the little time i have.
JOEL: i think about that.
CLEMENTINE: you're really nice. i'm sorry i yelled at you before about it. i'm an
JOEL: i do have a tendency to use that word too much.
CLEMENTINE: i like you. that's the thing about my psychic thing. i think that's my greatest psychic power, that i get a sense about people. my problem is i never trust it. but i get it. and with you i get that you're a really good guy.
JOEL: thanks.
CLEMENTINE: and, anyway, you sell yourself short. i can tell. there's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. i can tell. my goal... can i tell you my goal?
JOEL: yeah.
CLEMENTINE: what's the goal, joel? my goal, joel, is to just let it flow through me? do you know what i mean? it's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we're all taught we should be consistent. y'know? you love someone -- that's it. forever. you choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. it's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. and my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. you know?
JOEL: yeah. i think so. it's hard to --
CLEMENTINE: like i wanted to talk to you. i didn't need any more reason to do it. who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
JOEL: yeah.
CLEMENTINE: you're very nice. i have to stop saying that. you're nervous around me, huh?
JOEL: no.
CLEMENTINE: i'm nervous. you don't need to be nervous around me, though. i like you.
JOEL: no, not at all.
CLEMENTINE: i don't either. i used to. but i'm through with that. y'know, if i don't love my body, then i'm just lost. you know?
CLEMENTINE: with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend. so, i've been seeing this guy...
CLEMENTINE: well, for the last week, anyway! he's kind of a kid. kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. who wouldn't like that? and he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. he's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
JOEL: oh, yeah.
CLEMENTINE: that made me cry. but, anyway, we went up to boston, because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river. it gets frozen this time of year.
JOEL: that's scary sounding.
CLEMENTINE: exactly! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again, so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but i was really disappointment to be there with him. y'know? and that's where psychic stuff comes in. like, it just isn't right with him. y'know?
JOEL: i think so.
CLEMENTINE: i don't believe in that soulmate anymore, but... he says so many great things. we like the same writers. this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to. and he's cute. it's up. joel, you should come up to the charles with me sometime.
JOEL: okay.
CLEMENTINE: yeah? oh, great!
CLEMENTINE: i'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
JOEL: sounds good. but right now i should go.
CLEMENTINE: you should stay.
JOEL: i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
CLEMENTINE: okay.
CLEMENTINE: i would like you to call me. would you do that? i would like that.
JOEL: yes.
JOEL: i don't think your personality comes out of a tube. i think the hair is just... a pretty topping.
JOEL: so, i enjoyed meeting you.
CLEMENTINE: you'll call me, right?
JOEL: yeah.
CLEMENTINE: when?
JOEL: tomorrow?
CLEMENTINE: tonight. just to test out the phone lines and all.
JOEL: okay.

JOEL: it was snowing. 
VOICE-OVER: there are two of them. couldn't make them out. the orange glow of a cigarette.
JOEL: the driver waved. so casual, friendly.
VOICE-OVER: i'm like a joke to them.
VOICE-OVER: i guess they figure they can act like they want. they don't have to worry about me remembering.
JOEL: i might be making a mistake.
VOICE-OVER: maybe i'm making a mistake. maybe i just need to learn to live with this. first of all, i'll get over it. secondly, it happened. those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. who said that? churchill? i'm not sure. but i don't care. she did it to me. i have to rid myself of this. her.
JOEL: you, clementine.
JOEL: pink. there was a number on it. i remember.
AL 1718?: i have to follow through with this. i have no choice.
VOICE-OVER: the pill was pink, i remember. it had some letters and numbers on it. what were they? al 1718? al something. four digits. i don't like taking pills when i don't know what they are. i have no choice.
JOEL: we're sorry, the number you have dialed... screw you, clementine, for doing this ...
RECORDED VOICE: we're sorry, the number you have dialed is no longer in service. if you think you have reached this recording in error

JOEL: bye. 
JOEL: it's them.
VOICE-OVER: it's too late.
BLACK.: he hears a key in his apartment door.
JOEL: 

JOEL: i should maybe talk to you. 
VOICE-OVER: clementine. i should just maybe talk to her.
JOEL: i love you and if you knew that... if i told you what happened... i'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. i'll tell you everything about our time together. you'll know everything again and...
VOICE-OVER: maybe if i just explain what happened, i wouldn't have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
JOEL: clementine.
VOICE-OVER: that's your look for me.
PATRICK: i just thought i'd say hi. i was in the neighborhood.
CLEMENTINE: you were not.
PATRICK: i was not.
CLEMENTINE: come over after i'm done here?
PATRICK: i can't. i want to, but i have to study.
CLEMENTINE: you rat.
PATRICK: i really want to, but tonight's important. test tomorrow.
JOEL: how could she have done this to me? how could anyone do this to anyone?
CLEMENTINE: you didn't say anything about my hair.
PATRICK: it's so cool. you're by far the most sensational person in the room.
CLEMENTINE: in the room?
PATRICK: in the world.
JOEL: what's happening here? oh, i have to go home. they'll be there soon.

JOEL: gotta get home. how could she do this to me? how could she not care about what we meant to each other. what a what a monster she is! 
VOICE-OVER: oh, i miss her. i can't believe she's with that guy now! i'm never going to see her again. i love her so much. what a monster she is!
JOEL: them.

MARY: hello again, mr. barish. good, you've got your stuff. 
MARY: how are you today? here we are.

MIERZWIAK: ah, mr. barish. this is stan. he'll be in charge of your procedure tonight. 
STAN: mr. barish.
JOEL: how exactly is this going to work tonight?
MIERZWIAK: we'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- there is an emotional core to each of our memories -- as we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- by the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. like a dream upon waking.
JOEL: is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
MIERZWIAK: well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. nothing you'll miss.
JOEL: it's happening now! i'm already in my brain.
MIERZWIAK: yes, i suppose you are. so, let's get started -- if we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do.
STAN: we use the articles you brought to create a map of clementine in your brain. tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase.
JOEL: but you're tracing and erasing now. it's already started. i'm home in my bed.
STAN: very good.
MIERZWIAK: we'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here. that way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home.
STAN: good. we're getting healthy read-outs.
STAN'S VOICE: patrick, do me a favor --
STAN'S VOICE: -- and check the voltage levels, i'm not wiping as clean as i would like here.

PATRICK: the voltage looks fine. 
STAN: then check the connections.
PATRICK: does that help?
STAN: yeah, that looks better. thanks.

MIERZWIAK: ah, your journal. this will be invaluable. 
STAN: december 15th, 2004. i met someone tonight. oh, christ: i don't know what to do. her name is clementine and she's amazing. so alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. things with naomi and i have been stagnant for so long.
STAN'S VOICE: i think we got this one. let's push on.

MARY: may i help you? 
JOEL: my name is joel barish. i have an appointment.
MARY: please have a seat. dr. mierzwiak will be right with you.
MARY: how are you today?
JOEL: not great.
MARY: here we are.

MIERZWIAK: i'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. you never should have. 
JOEL: well... i did.
MIERZWIAK: we can help you through this. why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine.
JOEL: it was a mess. i don't know how it got this way...
PATRICK'S VOICE: it's kind of a dump, don't you think?

STAN: it's an apartment. 
PATRICK: not a dump, then, but kind of plain. uninspired. and there's a stale smell.
STAN: patrick, let's just get through this. we have a long night ahead of us.
PATRICK: yeah.
PATRICK: so who do you think is better-looking, me or this guy? stan glances sideways at patrick.
MIERZWIAK: so we'll need you to go home and bring in everything you ever received from clementine and anything that might remind you of her...

JOEL: so then she just stops calling. 
VOICE-OVER: i wasn't going to call her. not after the way she was.
JOEL: any messages, carmen? carmen the receptionist shakes her head.
JOEL: any messages for me, carmen.
CARMEN: nothing, joel.
VOICE-OVER: it's she's punishing me for being honest with her.
PHONE MACHINE VOICE: you have no messages.

JOEL: sorry, carmen. any messages? 
VOICE-OVER: that's it. i'm just gonna--
VOICE-OVER: i'm gonna tell her i'm through playing games and --
RECORDED VOICE: the number you have dialed has been disconnected.
JOEL: why would she do that?
VAGUE RECORDED VOICE: -- if you think you have reached this recording in error, please check your number and dial again.
CARRIE: i don't know, honey. it's horrible.
JOEL: she's punishing me for being honest. i should just go to her house.
ROB: i don't think you should go there, joel.
JOEL: yeah, i don't want to seem desperate.
CARRIE: maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. just make a clean break.
JOEL: i don't know. i'm so... i can't believe she'd be so immature!
ROB: joel, look, the thing is --
CARRIE: you weren't supposed to see that.
JOEL: they can't erase memories. it's a joke.
CARRIE: sweetie, we called the company. joel just stands there.
VOICE-OVER: lacuna: noun. a blank, a missing portion, especially in a manuscript.
CARRIE'S VOICE: you can't tell her, joel. they explained that. like waking a sleepwalker. it might have a devastating effect.
CARRIE'S VOICE: think about it: to be told you lived an existence of which you have no recollection.
JOEL'S VOICE: but what am i supposed to do?
CARRIE'S VOICE: move on, sweetie.
JOEL'S VOICE: how can i? how can i move on when i know i'm the only one to carry this love we had? how do i do that?

MARY: hi, may i help you? 
STAN'S VOICE: so, mary's coming over tonight.

PATRICK: yeah? 
STAN: just wanted to let you know.
PATRICK: i like mary. i like when she comes to visit. i just don't think she likes me.
STAN: she likes you okay.
PATRICK: i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over, too. i have a girlfriend now.
STAN: you can if you want.
PATRICK: did i tell you i have a new girlfriend?
STAN: this one's history. moving on...
PATRICK: the thing is ... my situation is a little weird. my girlfriend situation.
STAN: patrick, we need to focus.

CLEMENTINE: yo ho ho! 
JOEL: it's three.
VOICE-OVER: the last time i saw you.
CLEMENTINE: anyhoo, sweetie, i done a bad thing. i kinda sorta wrecked your car...
JOEL: i can't believe you wrecked my car.
JOEL: you're driving drunk. it's pathetic.
CLEMENTINE: ...a little. i was a little tipsy.
JOEL: well it is pathetic. and irresponsible. you could've killed somebody.
JOEL: i don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
CLEMENTINE: oh christ i didn't kill anybody. it's just a dent. you're like some old lady or something.
VOICE-OVER: right! she called me an old lady here, too! and i remember, i said...
JOEL: and what are you like? a wino?
CLEMENTINE: a wino? are you from the fifties? a wino! face it, joel. you're freaked out because i was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she someone tonight?
JOEL: no, see, clem, i assume you someone tonight. isn't that how you get people to like you?
JOEL: i'm sorry. okay. i didn't mean that. i just... i was just... pissed, i guess.

JOEL: let me drive you home. 
CLEMENTINE: you, joel. faggot.
JOEL: look at it out here. it's falling apart. i'm erasing you. and i'm happy. she keeps clomping.
JOEL: you did it to me. i can't believe you did this to me. by morning you'll be gone. ha!

PATRICK'S VOICE: see, remember that girl? the one we did last week? the one with the potatoes? 
STAN'S VOICE: yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend. was.

PATRICK: i gotta tell you something. i kind of fell in love with her last night. 
STAN: she was unconscious, patrick.
PATRICK: she was beautiful. so sweet and funky and voluptuous. i kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
STAN: patrick!

PATRICK'S VOICE: i know. it's not like... i mean, they were clean and all. 
STAN'S VOICE: look, just don't tell me this stuff. i don't want to know this
PATRICK'S VOICE: yeah, okay.
STAN'S VOICE: we have work to do.

PATRICK'S VOICE: okay, but there's more. 
PATRICK'S VOICE: after we did her, i went to where she worked and i asked her out.
STAN'S VOICE: patrick... do you know how unethical...
JOEL: that must be the guy i saw you with.
VOICE-OVER: in the bookstore that night. the skinny guy.

CLEMENTINE: how can you watch this crap? 
JOEL: where are you going?
CLEMENTINE: i'm crawling out of my skin.

JOEL: oh i remember this. want to go? 
CLEMENTINE: i want to have a baby.
JOEL: let's talk about it later.
CLEMENTINE: no. i want to have a baby. i have to have a baby.
JOEL: i don't think we're ready.
CLEMENTINE: you're not ready.
JOEL: clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid? she turns violently toward him, glaring.
CLEMENTINE: what?!
JOEL: i don't want to talk about this here.
CLEMENTINE: joel, we're gonna talk about it! joel looks around. people are watching.
CLEMENTINE: you can't say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
JOEL: clem, i'm sorry. i shouldn't have --
JOEL: oh, thank it's going.
CLEMENTINE: it's you! it's you who can't commit to anything! you have no idea how lucky you are i'm interested in you! i don't even know why i am! i should just end it right here, joel. leave you in the zoo. maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
JOEL: it's going, clementine. all the and hurt and disappointment. it's all being wiped away. she looks up at him.
CLEMENTINE: i'm glad.
JOEL: me, too.

JOEL: so, um -- 
CLEMENTINE: would you get me another, joely?
CLEMENTINE: thanky! thanky!
CLEMENTINE: joel, this is mark. he likes my boobs. he came over special to tell me that. isn't that nice. he doesn't think i'm fat.
MARK: i didn't know she was with someone, man.
CLEMENTINE: s'okay, mark. joel doesn't like my boobs. i don't think he likes girls.
JOEL: you're drunk.
CLEMENTINE: you're a whiz kid. so perceptive, so --

MARY: oh, hey, patrick. 
PATRICK: hi, mary. how's it going?
STAN: hey, you.
MARY: it's freezing out.
STAN: you found us okay?
MARY: yeah. poor guy. have anything to drink?
STAN: we haven't checked.
MARY: well, allow me to do the honors. it's freezing and i need something.
PATRICK: mary hates me. i've never been popular with the ladies.
STAN: maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
PATRICK: okay, there's more, stan --
MARY: hey, hey.
MARY: oh, patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
PATRICK: nah, i don't know.
MARY: blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders.
MARY: nietzsche. beyond good and evil. found it my bartletts.
STAN: that's a good one.
MARY: yeah, i can't wait to tell howard! it seems really appropriate.
STAN: it's a good one all right.
PATRICK: what's your bartlett's?
STAN: it's a quote book.
MARY: i love quotes. so did winston churchill. he actually has a quotation in bartlett's about bartlett's. isn't that trippy?
PATRICK: yeah. cool.
MARY: "the quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
PATRICK: very cool. trippy.
MARY: i like to read what smart people say. so many beautiful, important things.
STAN: yup.
MARY: don't you think howard's like that?
STAN: yup.
PATRICK: definitely!
MARY: i think he'll be in bartlett's one day.
PATRICK: definitely.

CLEMENTINE: you don't tell me things, joel. i'm an open book. i tell you everything. every embarrassing thing. you don't trust me. 
JOEL: no, it isn't that.
CLEMENTINE: i want to know you.
JOEL: i just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
CLEMENTINE: joel, you're a liar.

JOEL: how's the chicken? 
VOICE-OVER: is that like us? are we just bored with each other?
CLEMENTINE: good.
CLEMENTINE: more?
JOEL: no. thanks.
CLEMENTINE: how's the fish?
JOEL: it's good.
PATRICK'S VOICE: hi, clementine! -- why, what's wrong? -- oh, i'm sorry. -- well, i'm not sure, i kind of have to study for my test --

PATRICK: hold on. let me ask my friend. stan, can i leave for a little while? my girlfriend is very -- 
STAN: patrick, we're in the middle of --
PATRICK: she's right in the neighborhood. she's upset.
MARY: let him go, stan. i can help.
STAN: go.
PATRICK: mary hates me. i'll be right over, tangerine.

CLEMENTINE: joely... 
JOEL: yeah, tangerine?
CLEMENTINE: do you know the velveteen rabbit?
JOEL: no.
CLEMENTINE: it's my favorite book. since i was a kid. it's about these toys. there's this part where the skin horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real. i can't believe i'm crying already. he says, "it takes a long time. that's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. but these things don't matter at all, because once you are real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand." she's weeping. joel is stroking her hair. they kiss and
JOEL: no! no!
JOEL: please! please! i've changed my mind! i don't want this. wake me up! stop the procedure! plea --

MARY: it's amazing, isn't it? such a gift howard gave the world. 
STAN: yeah.
MARY: to let people begin again. it's beautiful. you look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. and adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. and howard just makes it go away.
STAN: you love him, don't you?
MARY: no. besides, howard's married, stan. he's a very serious and ethical man. i'm not going to tempt him to betray all he believes in.

PATRICK: oh, baby, what's going on? 
CLEMENTINE: i don't know. i'm lost. i'm scared. i feel like i'm disappearing. i'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
PATRICK: oh, tangerine.
CLEMENTINE: nothing makes any sense. nothing makes any sense.
CLEMENTINE: come up to boston with me?
PATRICK: sure. we'll go next weekend and --
CLEMENTINE: now. now! i have to go now. i have to see the frozen charles! now! tonight!
PATRICK: um, okay. i'll call my study partner.
CLEMENTINE: yay! it'll be great! i'll get my
JOEL'S VOICE: hi, it's joel. please leave a message after the beep.
PATRICK: stan, it's patrick. pick up.
STAN'S VOICE: hey, where are you?
PATRICK: i got into a situation with the old lady. can you handle things tonight alone? i'm really sorry, man.

PATRICK: thanks, stan. i owe you. 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: i took joel to walk on charles river with me last night. it was so beautiful and charming. joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to please me so much -- he's so sweet -- that he came out after me. we lay down right in the center and watched the stars. he took my hand and said "i could...

JOEL: ...die right now, clem. i'm just... happy. i've never felt that before. i'm just exactly where i want to be. 
JOEL: clem, no! this can't keep happening. please! oh, please!
MIERZWIAK: we can help you through this. why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
JOEL: you have to stop this!
MIERZWIAK: what? what do you mean?
JOEL: i'm trapped in my head and everything i love is being erased! stop it now!
MIERZWIAK: yes, but... i'm just something you're imagining. what can i do? i'm in your head, too.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: ... and we made love right on the ice. it was absolutely freezing on my ass! it was wonderful.
CLEMENTINE: i'm so excited. yay!
PATRICK: i'm excited, too. oh, and i wanted to give you this. it's a little... thing.
PATRICK: i didn't have a chance to wrap it.
CLEMENTINE: it's gorgeous. just my taste. i've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry i liked. thanks. so let's get going. long drive.

CLEMENTINE: such a beautiful view. 
JOEL: yes indeed. they're erasing you, clem!
CLEMENTINE: oh?
JOEL: i hired them to. we're in my brain. but i want it to stop, before i wake up and don't know you anymore.
CLEMENTINE: wow. um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
JOEL: i don't know.
JOEL: aaargh! it's horrible! i'm trapped!

VOICE-OVER: she's so sexy. 
JOEL: i loved you on this day. i love this memory. the rain. us just hanging.
CLEMENTINE: what if you hide me?
JOEL: what do you mean?
JOEL: where? where? where?

CLEMENTINE: what's this? 
JOEL: i must be about two. i want my mommy. she's busy. she's not looking at me. look, my huckleberry hound doll! i told you about this! i want my mommy! he starts to cry. clementine tries to comfort him. she hugs him.
JOEL: i want my mommy. i don't want to lose you, clem.
CLEMENTINE: i'm right here.
JOEL: i'm scared. i want my mommy. i don't want to lose you. i don't want to lose...
CLEMENTINE: joel, joely, look... it's not fading. the memory. i think we're hidden.

STAN: it's stopped. 
MARY: what?
STAN: listen, it's not erasing.
STAN: it's not erasing. he's off the screen.
MARY: where?
STAN: i don't know. he's not on the map.
STAN: i don't know what to do! i don't know what to do! crap. crap...
MARY: well, what should we do?
STAN: i don't know! i just said that!
MARY: sor-ry we have to do something. he can't wake up half done.
STAN: 
MARY: we should call howard.
STAN: no way. i can handle this.
MARY: this guy's only half cooked. there's no time to around, stan.
STAN: okay.
STAN: hello, howard?

MIERZWIAK: stan? what's going on? 
STAN'S VOICE: the guy we're doing? he's disappeared from the map. i can't find him anywhere.
MIERZWIAK: okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
STAN'S VOICE: i was away from the monitor for a second. i had it on automatic. i had to go pee.
MIERZWIAK: well, where was patrick?
STAN'S VOICE: he went home sick.
MIERZWIAK: all right, what's the address.
STAN'S VOICE: 1062 sherman drive. apartment 1e, rockville center.
MARY: he's coming?
STAN: you better go.
MARY: no.
MARY: i'm so stoned. i don't want him to see me stoned. stop being stoned, mary! she hurries into the bathroom with her bag.
MARY: i look like

MOTHER: how's my baby boy? 
JOEL: i really want her to pick me up. it's weird how strong that desire is.
CLEMENTINE: you know, we're okay. they're not finding us. you'll remember me in the morning. and you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
JOEL: i loved you so much this day. on my bed in your panties. i remember i thought, how impossibly lucky am i to have you on my bed in your panties.
CLEMENTINE: you remember what happened next?
JOEL: i came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. and i climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
CLEMENTINE: -- another rainy day. whatever shall we do?
JOEL: there's this guy!
CLEMENTINE: what?
JOEL: there's this guy. i heard him talking in my apartment. he's one of the eraser guys. and he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
CLEMENTINE: really? is he cute?
JOEL: he stole a pair of your while you were being erased!
CLEMENTINE: gross! you must remember to tell me this in the morning. i'm, like, so freaked out now.

CLEMENTINE: what's wrong with me? 
PATRICK: nothing is wrong with you. you're the most wonderful person i've ever met.

MARY: there he is. oh my oh my do i look okay? 
MARY: i'm still stoned. are you? crap.
MIERZWIAK: mary. what are you doing here?
STAN: she came to help, howard.
MARY: i wanted to learn as much about the procedure as possible, howard. i think it's important for my job...to help comfort the clientele. you know.
MIERZWIAK: let's get to the bottom of this. shall we?
MIERZWIAK: odd.
STAN: i tried that already.
MIERZWIAK: did you try going through c-gate?
STAN: yeah. of course.
MIERZWIAK: i'm going to do a spectrum search throughout his memory, see if anything comes up.
MIERZWIAK: okay, here it is. i don't know why it's off the map like that, but --

MOTHER: little baby getting awwwl cleean. awl clean. 
JOEL: i love getting bathed in the sink. it's such a feeling of security.

MIERZWIAK: okay, we're back in. 
MARY: that was beautiful to watch, howard.
MIERZWIAK: well, thank you, mary.
STAN: you get some sleep, howard. i'll take it from here.
MIERZWIAK: yeah, probably a good idea.

CLEMENTINE: but can't you see... i love you, antoine. 
JOEL: don't call me antoine. my name is wally.
CLEMENTINE: yes, but i can't love a man named wally.
JOEL: they found us before. the plan didn't work. i don't know what to do now.
CLEMENTINE: hide me somewhere deeper? somewhere buried?

STAN: howard, they've disappeared again. 
MIERZWIAK: oh dear.
MARY: i'm so sorry, howard, you must be tired.

CLEMENTINE: look at you, cutey! what are we doing? 
JOEL: this kid, joe early, is going to beat the out of me.
VOICE-OVER: i'm terrified. i thought if i hung around the art room long enough, he'd go home and i could get my bike.
CLEMENTINE: poor joel.
JOE EARLY: hi, jill.
JOEL: he calls me jill. everyone calls me jill after this. the other kids laughs.
JOEL: just shut up, joe. i'm going home.
JOE EARLY: i don't think so. we're fighting.
JOEL: i don't want to fight you.
JOE EARLY: c'mon, jill. get up, faggot. c'mon.
JOEL: i'm too scared to even throw a punch. when i tell people this story i leave that part out.
MIERZWIAK: we got him back. stan, i think i'm just going to have to get through this manually. we're running late.

CLEMENTINE: our house! our house! 
JOEL: clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you. remember?

CLEMENTINE: joel! 
JOEL: i don't like it either, but i'm just trying to find horrible secret place to -- joel's mother pops her head in the door.
MOTHER: joel, i was just --

JOEL: happy birthday. 
CLEMENTINE: thanks, joely. a present! oh boy!
CLEMENTINE: oh, joel. it's beautiful! i mean, you're the first guy who ever bought me a piece of jewelry i could honestly say that about.
JOEL: i scoured the city for it.
CLEMENTINE: i love it!

JOEL: i can't. i have to go home. i'll do it later. 
VOICE-OVER: i didn't want to do this. but i had to or they would've called me a girl.
VOICE-OVER: i can't believe i did that. i'm so ashamed.
CLEMENTINE: it's okay. you were a little kid. this is a great birthday present. getting to see you as a boy.
JOEL: that's where i live. lived.

MIERZWIAK: i'm getting the hang of it. i still understand it. but i'm finding him quickly enough. i'm hopeful there won't be too much peripheral eradication. 
MARY: i like watching you work.
STAN: i'll go out for a smoke. if no one minds.
MIERZWIAK: that's fine, stan.
MARY: do you like quotes, howard?
MIERZWIAK: how do you mean?
MARY: oh, um, like famous quotes. i find reading them inspirational to me. and in my reading i've come across some i thought you might like, too.
MIERZWIAK: oh. well, i'd love to hear some.
MARY: okay, um, there's one that goes "blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
MIERZWIAK: is that nietzsche?
MARY: yeah, yeah it is, howard. and here i was thinking i could tell you something you didn't know.
MIERZWIAK: it's a good quote, mary. i'm glad we both know it. he smiles at her. she's flustered, flattered.
MARY: there's another one i like, i read. it's by pope alexander.
MIERZWIAK: alexander pope?
MARY: yes, oops, sorry! sorry. it's just i told myself i wasn't going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it. like i psyched myself out.
MIERZWIAK: it's no big deal.
MARY: you are such a sweetheart.
MARY: anyway, the quote goes "how happy is the blameless vestal's lot! the world forgetting, by the world forgot: eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd". she smiles, proud and embarrassed.
MIERZWIAK: that's lovely.
MARY: really? i thought it was appropriate maybe. that's all. i really admire the work that you do. i know it's not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we're outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to --
MIERZWIAK: it's fine, mary. i'm happy to hear it.
MARY: okay. good. great. thanks. i like you, howard... an awful lot. is that terrible?
MIERZWIAK: you're a wonderful girl, mary.
MARY: i've loved you for a very long time. i'm sorry! i shouldn't have said that.
MIERZWIAK: i've got a wife, mary. kids. you know that.
MIERZWIAK: we can't do this.
MARY: no you're right. once again. you're a decent man, howard.
MIERZWIAK: i want you to know it's not because i'm not interested. if that means anything.

MARY: what? 
MARY: oh my

MIERZWIAK: it didn't start out to be this. i came here to work. it's a one-time mistake. 
MARY: mrs. mierzwiak, it's true. and it's not mr. mierzwiak's fault. i'm a stupid little girl with a stupid little crush. i basically forced him into it. i swear.
HOLLIS: don't be a monster, howard. tell the girl.
MARY: tell me what?
HOLLIS: poor kid. you can have him. you did.
MARY: what, howard?
MIERZWIAK: we... have a history. i'm sorry. you wanted the procedure. you wanted it done... to get past. i have to finish in there. it's almost morning. we'll talk later.
STAN: let me take you home.

PATRICK: i could die right now, clem. i'm just happy. i've never felt that before. i'm just exactly where i want to be. 
CLEMENTINE: i want to go home.

CLEMENTINE: i love this book, joel. thank you so much for telling me about it. 
FATHER: don't be like me, son. don't waste your life. you'll come to a point someday where it'll be too late. you'll be sewn into your fate...
JOEL: it was horrifying, seeing my father like that. there was no hope for me if his life was such a failure. and he saw failure in me, too, written in my future.
CLEMENTINE: joel, you're not sewn in. he's wrong.
FATHER: ...and there'll be nowhere to go except where you're headed, like a train on a track. inevitable, unalterable.

JOEL: i'm done, clem. i'm just going to ride it out. hiding is clearly not working. 
CLEMENTINE: yeah.
JOEL: i want to enjoy my little time left with you.
CLEMENTINE: this is our first "date" date.
JOEL: do you remember what we talked about?
CLEMENTINE: naomi, i guess.
JOEL: yeah.
CLEMENTINE: what was i wearing?
JOEL: i should know. your hair was red.
CLEMENTINE: egad, were you horrified?
JOEL: no! i think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
CLEMENTINE: no, you were with me when i bought that. at that place on east 6th. it was later.

JOEL: right. something black though. 
CLEMENTINE: i'll buy that. black's always good.
JOEL: we did talk about naomi.
CLEMENTINE: i said: are you sure? you seem unsure.
JOEL: i'm sure, i said.
CLEMENTINE: but you weren't. i could tell.
JOEL: i was so nervous. i remember i couldn't think of anything to say. there were long silences.
JOEL: i thought i was foolish. i thought i'd mistaken infatuation for love. you said:
CLEMENTINE: so what. infatuation is good, too.
JOEL: and i didn't have an argument.

JOEL: i dropped you off after. you said -- 
CLEMENTINE: come up and see me... now.
JOEL: it's very late.
CLEMENTINE: yes, exactly. exactly my point.

MIERZWIAK VOICE: okay, so just tell me what you remember. and we'll take it from there. 
MARY'S VOICE: um, i liked you immediately. at the job interview. you seemed so... important and mature. and i loved that you were helping all these people. you didn't come on to me at all. i liked that. i was tongue-tied around you at first. i wanted you to think i was smart. you were so nice. i loved the way you smelled. i couldn't wait to come to work. i had these fantasies of us being married and having kids and just... ...and so... then... when... that one day, when i thought you looked at me back... like... oh, howie, i can't do this? how can i do this?
MIERZWIAK VOICE: it's what's best, mary. you know that.
MARY'S VOICE: yeah, i know. oh, okay, well, i was so excited...
MARY'S VOICE: ...remember you bought me that little wind-up frog?
MARY'S VOICE: and you said...
MARY'S VOICE: "this is for your desk. just a little token"
MARY'S VOICE: i knew then... i knew something was going to happen... something wonderful.

JOEL: naomi. 
VOICE-OVER: on the couch. dark. quiet. i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake. i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. i thought i could take it back, erase it, explain i had momentarily lost my mind. then i told myself we weren't happy. that was the truth. that what we were was safe. it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her, but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. but i wanted fun. i saw other people having fun and i wanted it. then i thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; i'm being suckered by advertising and movie then i thought maybe not, maybe not. and then i thought, as i always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
VOICE-OVER: i projected myself to the end of my life in some vague rendition of my old man self. i imagined looking back with a tremendous hole of regret in my heart.
VOICE-OVER: i didn't pick up the phone to call you, naomi. i didn't pick up the phone.

NAOMI: yours? 
JOEL: you take it. i don't know.
JOEL: naomi, i really value our relationship. i hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
NAOMI: don't do this to me now, joel. really.

JOEL: i told her today i need to end it. 
CLEMENTINE: is that what you want?
JOEL: i did it. i guess that means something.
NAOMI: so what's going on, joel?
JOEL: i don't know, i've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
NAOMI: what?
JOEL: y'know, we've been, i don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
NAOMI: don't say "we" when you mean "you."
JOEL: i think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- how can one person be unhappy? if one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
NAOMI: who is it? you met someone.
JOEL: no. i just need some space, maybe.
NAOMI: the thing is, joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be joel with the same problems.
JOEL: it's not somebody else.
VOICE-OVER: i hate myself.

JOEL: is there a clementine who works here? 
MALE EMPLOYEE #1: mark, is clem on tonight?
MALE EMPLOYEE #2: on my dick, bro. oh, hey. yeah, i think she's upstairs in philosophy.
JOEL: hi.
CLEMENTINE: i didn't think you'd show your face around me again. i figured you were humiliated. you did run away, after all.
JOEL: sorry to track you down like this. i'm not a stalker. but i needed to see you.
CLEMENTINE: yeah?
JOEL: i'd like to... take you out or something.
CLEMENTINE: well, you're married.
JOEL: not yet. not married.
CLEMENTINE: look, man, i'm telling you right off the bat, i'm high maintenance. so i'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. if you want to be with me, you're with me.
JOEL: okay.
CLEMENTINE: so make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
JOEL: i just think that you have some kind of... quality that seems really important to me.
CLEMENTINE: joel, i'm not a concept. i want you to just keep that in your head. too many guys think i'm a concept or i complete them or i'm going to make them alive, but i'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. don't assign me yours.
JOEL: i remember that speech really well.
CLEMENTINE: i had you pegged, didn't i?
JOEL: you had the whole human race pegged.
CLEMENTINE: probably.
JOEL: i still thought you were going to save me. even after that.
CLEMENTINE: i know.
JOEL: it would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
CLEMENTINE: remember me. try your best. maybe we can.

JOEL: thanks, guys. 
CARRIE: i hope you feel better, sweetie.
JOEL: yeah.
CARRIE: say hi to naomi.
VOICE-OVER: i hope she's not up. i need to think.

VOICE-OVER: i met someone tonight at a party on the beach. her name is clementine. there is something alive about her. 
NAOMI: hi.
JOEL: hi.
NAOMI: how was it?
JOEL: you didn't miss much. rob carrie say hello.
NAOMI: hi, rob and carrie.
JOEL: go back to sleep.
NAOMI: yeah. come to bed. i'm cold.
JOEL: in a minute.
VOICE-OVER: i don't know what to do about this. i've been feeling so alienated and numb lately. forever. the thought of not acknowledging my feelings again seems self-destructive. how can i continue on this path toward a living death, a life filled with obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless, hopeless? i need to speak with clementine.

JOEL: so you don't mind? 
NAOMI: i've got to finish this chapter anyway.
JOEL: okay. i wish you could come.
VOICE-OVER: this is it. the night we met. my it's over.
NAOMI: me, too.
NAOMI: say hi to rob and carrie. have some fun!
JOEL: i hope you get your work done.
NAOMI: yeah.

CARRIE: i'm sorry naomi couldn't make it. you okay? you seem quiet. 
JOEL: just a little overworked, maybe.
VOICE-OVER: the trip to the party where i met clementine. my first memory of her is now my last memory of her.
JOEL: i remember you turned around. your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- i could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between naomi and me.
CARRIE: i did. you said, things were fine.
JOEL: i remember.
CARRIE: this is the night you met clementine, joel. i remember watching you walk down the beach with her and i thought, oh
JOEL: yeah, you told me that later.
CARRIE: i told you that later.

CARRIE: who was the girl you walked off with? 
JOEL: no one.

JOEL: you were down by the surf. i could just make you out in the dark. 
JOEL: your back to me. in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually. at the time i thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
VOICE-OVER: i remember being drawn to you even then. i thought, i love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
JOEL: but i went back to my food. the next thing i remember, i felt someone sitting next to me and i saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
CLEMENTINE: hi there.
JOEL: hi.
VOICE-OVER: i was so nervous. what were you doing there, i wondered. your hair was lime green. green revolution.
JOEL: you said...
CLEMENTINE: i saw you sitting over here. by yourself. i thought, thank someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
JOEL: yeah. i don't ever know what to say.
CLEMENTINE: i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that. i mean, i don't mean i'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... i'm such a loser. every time i come to a party i tell myself i'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod.
JOEL: even then i didn't believe you entirely. i thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
VOICE-OVER: but i thought, i don't know, i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
CLEMENTINE: but, i don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? i mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
VOICE-OVER: and i just liked you so much.
CLEMENTINE: you did? you liked me?
JOEL: you know what i did.
CLEMENTINE: yeah, i know. i'm fishing.
JOEL: you said -- she picks a drumstick off of joel's plate.
CLEMENTINE: i'm clementine. can i borrow a piece of your chicken?
JOEL: and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
JOEL: i remember --
VOICE-OVER: the grease on your chin in the bonfire light.
CLEMENTINE: oh how horrid.
JOEL: i'm joel.
VOICE-OVER: no, it was lovely.
CLEMENTINE: hi, joel. so no jokes about my name?
JOEL: you mean, like... oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', clementine... ? huckleberry hound? that sort of thing?
CLEMENTINE: yeah, like that.
JOEL: nope. no jokes. my favorite thing when i was a kid was my huckleberry hound doll. i think your name is magic.
CLEMENTINE: this is it, joel. it's gonna be gone soon.
JOEL: i know.
CLEMENTINE: what do we do?
JOEL: enjoy it. say good-bye. she nods.
JOEL: so you're still on the zoloft?
VOICE-OVER: next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf.
CLEMENTINE: no, i stopped. i didn't want to feel like i was being artificially modulated.
JOEL: i know what you mean. that's why i stopped.
CLEMENTINE: but my sleeping is really up.
JOEL: i don't think i've slept in a year.
CLEMENTINE: you should try xanax. i mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. like insurance.
JOEL: yeah?
CLEMENTINE: i'll give you a couple. see what you think.
JOEL: okay.
CLEMENTINE: have you ever read any anna akhmatova?
JOEL: i love her.
CLEMENTINE: really? me, too! i don't meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store.
JOEL: i think she's great.
CLEMENTINE: me too. there's this poem --
JOEL: did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
CLEMENTINE: i think, before.
JOEL: seems too coincidental that way.
CLEMENTINE: yeah, maybe.
CLEMENTINE: do you know her poem that starts "seaside gusts of wind,/and a house in which we don't live...
JOEL: yeah, yeah. it goes "perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines"?
CLEMENTINE: yes! i love that poem. it breaks my heart. i'm so excited you know it. look, houses in which we don't live.
CLEMENTINE: i wish we did. you married?
JOEL: um, no.
CLEMENTINE: let's move into this neighborhood.
JOEL: i do sort of live with somebody though.
CLEMENTINE: oh.
CLEMENTINE: male or female?
JOEL: female.
CLEMENTINE: at least i haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
CLEMENTINE: cool.
JOEL: what are you doing?
CLEMENTINE: it's freezing out here.
JOEL: clementine.
VOICE-OVER: i couldn't believe you did that. i was paralyzed with fear.
CLEMENTINE: c'mon, man. the water's fine. nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. this place is closed up. electricity's off.
JOEL: i hesitated for what seemed like forever.
CLEMENTINE: i could see you wanted to come in, joel. he walks cautiously toward the door.
CLEMENTINE: as soon as you walked in. i knew i had you. you knew i knew that, right?

JOEL: i knew. 
CLEMENTINE: i knew by your nervousness that naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
JOEL: it's dark.
CLEMENTINE: yeah. what's your girlfriend's name?
JOEL: naomi.
CLEMENTINE: ah-ha! now i can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
JOEL: i think we should go.
CLEMENTINE: no, it's our house! just tonight -- -- we're david and ruth laskin. which one do you want to be? i prefer to be ruth but i'm flexible. alcohol! you make drinks. i'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more ruth. i'm ruthless at the moment.
JOEL: i really should go. i really need to catch my ride.
VOICE-OVER: i didn't want to go. i was too nervous. i thought, maybe you were a nut. but you were exciting. you called from upstairs.
CLEMENTINE: so go.
JOEL: i did. i walked out the door. i felt like i was a scared little kid. i thought you knew that about me. i ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. you said, "so go" with such disdain.
CLEMENTINE: what if you stay this time?
JOEL: i walked out the door. there's no more memory.
CLEMENTINE: come back and make up a good-bye at least. let's pretend we had one.
CLEMENTINE: bye, joel.
JOEL: i love you.

HOWARD: okay. 
HOLLIS'S VOICE: hi, you've reached the mierzwiaks. we can't come to -- howard hangs up.

STAN: so, i've got to drop the van off. 
MIERZWIAK: thanks, stan. thanks.

PATRICK: you want to stop for coffee or something? mary shakes her head "no." long silence. 
PATRICK: well, it was sure beautiful on that river. thanks for sharing it with me.
PATRICK: well do it again soon.

STAN: hey. 
MARY: do you swear you didn't know?
STAN: i swear.
MARY: and you never even suspected? never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
STAN: once, maybe.
STAN: it was here. at his car. i was coming back from a job and spotted you together. you seemed caught. i waved. you giggled.
MARY: how did i look?
STAN: happy. happy with a secret.
MARY: and after that?
STAN: i never saw you together like that again. so i figured i was imagining things. mary says nothing.
STAN: i really like you, mary. you know that.
MARY: do you remember anything else? what i was wearing? was i standing close to him? was i leaning against his car like i owned it? how did he look at me when i giggled? tell me everything.
STAN: you were in red. that red sweater with the little flowers, i think. you were leaning against his car. he looked a little like a kid. kind of goofy and wide-eyed. i'd never seen him look like that before. happy. you looked beautiful. you looked in love.
MARY: thanks, stan.
MARY: you're nice. but i love him. i knew i loved him. now i know.

MARY: i need this signed, howard. 
MARY: thanks. so... do we talk about this... or what?
MIERZWIAK: i don't know what i'm supposed say, mary. i want to do the right thing here.
MARY: do you love me? did you love me? something. i listened to my tape. i can't believe i've been sitting right in front of it for a year. it's like listening to someone else's story. i mean, i hear myself talking about having with you and i can't even imagine you naked. i can't even say "naked" to you!
MIERZWIAK: i have a family, mary.
MARY: you made me have an abortion.
MIERZWIAK: it was a mutual decision.
MARY: you made me have you erased! i loved you. i love you! how could you --
MIERZWIAK: i didn't make you. you thought it best. but, look, i take full responsibility.
NAOMI: so... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
JOEL: it's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
NAOMI: i'm sorry.
JOEL: well, it was my fault -- the break-up.
NAOMI: oh, sweetie. it really does cut both ways. we were taking each other for granted and --
JOEL: i miss you.
NAOMI: miss you, too. i have been seeing someone for a little while.
JOEL: oh! great. that's great!
NAOMI: a religion instructor at columbia. a good guy. he's a good guy.
JOEL: i'm sorry. i really shouldn't have --
NAOMI: i'm glad you called.

JOEL: so you think the dissertation will get published? 
NAOMI: i don;t know. i'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on calvinism and misogyny.

CLEMENTINE: so you'll call me, right? 
JOEL: yeah.
CLEMENTINE: when?
JOEL: tomorrow?
CLEMENTINE: tonight. just to test out the phone lines.
JOEL: yeah.

JOEL: hi, naomi, it's joel. 
NAOMI'S VOICE: hi.
JOEL: how's it going?
NAOMI'S VOICE: good. i called you at work today. they said you were home sick.
JOEL: i know. i had to take the day to think.
NAOMI'S VOICE: yeah, i tried you at home. did you get my message?
JOEL: i just got in.
NAOMI'S VOICE: long day thinking.
JOEL: yeah, i suppose so.
NAOMI ON MACHINE: hi. they told me you were sick! so... where are you?! i had a really nice time last night. just wanted to say hi, so...
NAOMI'S VOICE: that's me.
JOEL: there you are. naomi, it's just... i'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
NAOMI: okay, joel. i suppose you're right.
JOEL: i had a good time last night. i really did.
NAOMI: so i'm going to get some sleep. i'm glad you're okay.
JOEL: we'll speak soon.
NAOMI: 'night.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: what took you so long?
JOEL: i just walked in.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: hmmm. do you miss me?
JOEL: oddly enough, i do.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: ha ha! you said, i do. i guess that means we're married.
JOEL: i guess so.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.

CLEMENTINE: don't worry. it's really solid this time of year. 
JOEL: i don't know.
JOEL: this is so beautiful.
CLEMENTINE: isn't it?
JOEL: i don't know. what if it breaks?
CLEMENTINE: what if?
JOEL: i think i should go back.
CLEMENTINE: joel, come here. please.
JOEL: listen, did you want to make love?
CLEMENTINE: make love?
JOEL: have sex. y'know --
CLEMENTINE: oh, um...
JOEL: because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
CLEMENTINE: that's okay. i --
JOEL: i'm sorry. i just wanted to say that. this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
CLEMENTINE: hey, joel --
JOEL: -- and i'm just too nervous around you right now.
CLEMENTINE: i'm nervous, too.
JOEL: yeah? i wouldn't have thought that.
CLEMENTINE: well, you obviously don't know me.
JOEL: i'm nervous because i have and enormous crush on you.
CLEMENTINE: show me which constellations you know.

CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: yeah? 
JOEL: did you send this? is it a joke?
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: i probably got the same thing as you.
JOEL: i mean, i haven't even told anyone i've met you. who would even know to do this?
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: maybe it's true then. it's my voice on the tape.
JOEL: that's what you have to say? how could it be true? i never even heard of any procedure like this. it's a joke.
CLEMENTINE: maybe. call someone who'd know.

CARRIE: yes, joel. it is true. we weren't supposed to say anything. they say it's like waking a sleepwalker. 
JOEL: it's true.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: i know. i spoke to my friend magda.
JOEL: look, i have to go. i have to think.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: joel, we've we've made love. like a million times. and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. isn't that lovely?
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: come over here, sweetheart. please.

CLEMENTINE: says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling. 
JOEL: says you were a bully...
CLEMENTINE: a bully? moi?
JOEL: that's what it says. you drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
CLEMENTINE: well, sounds like me. sorry, man. says you were jealous and suspicious.
JOEL: says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
CLEMENTINE: did i use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
JOEL: i don't know.
CLEMENTINE: doesn't sound like me.
JOEL: says you were a slob, leaving trails of and dirty socks in your wake.
CLEMENTINE: says you were constantly calling me a slob. it's that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. don't you think?
JOEL: i sort of do. but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality. cleaned up enough to be erotic.
CLEMENTINE: we should have sex. it's old hat for us. she smiles at nervous joel.
CLEMENTINE: you know my body like the back of your hand.
CLEMENTINE: every curve, every freckle.
JOEL: you're so beautiful.

RECEPTIONIST: may i help you? 
STAN: i work here. i used to work here. stan. please just tell howard i'm here to clean out my desk.
RECEPTIONIST: mr. mierzwiak, stan is here to -- yes sir. he says he needs to see you.
MIERZWIAK: she should not have done this, stan. as mad as she was... as justifiably --
STAN: i don't know what you're talking about, howard.
MIERZWIAK: mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
STAN: 
YOUNG WOMAN: ... so i called everybody i know and asked them to tell me everything. now i know my entire history with him, but it's in the form of a story, i'm losing my mind.
MIERZWIAK: this is why people must never be told.
YOUNG WOMAN: i don't know what to do. before i thought i was depressed for no reason. now it's like i've been assigned a reason.
PATRICK: this never should've happened, ma'am.
MIERZWIAK: i know you don't like me much, stan, but please talk to mary. she of all people should know this is a dangerous thing she's doing.
JOEL: hi, it's joel.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: hey, lover. whatcha doing?
JOEL: i'm just, y'know, passing the time best i can till i can see you.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: i can't believe i ever hated you.
JOEL: you must have been crazy.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: guess what i'm wearing.
JOEL: i don't know. and --
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: your dried cum.
JOEL: 
CLEMENTINE: you're still excited by my irreverence. you haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
JOEL: i can't stop thinking about you.
CLEMENTINE: yay. meet me after work by the old mill.
JOEL: what old mill? is that somewhere we --
CLEMENTINE: i just wanted to say that. come by my house.

MARY: oh. 
STAN: hi.
MARY: what do you want, stan?
STAN: can i... i brought some --
STAN: what's this?
MARY: nothing.
STAN: i know what it is.
MARY: then why did you ask me?
STAN: i don't know. i just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
MARY: they have a right to know. howard is a thief. he steals the truth. i can't remember my baby! i can't remember my baby. it existed and i can't even remember. do you understand that?
STAN: mary, people come to him voluntarily.
MARY: i won't allow it. those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. what do you think of that? that's from my quote book.
STAN: the office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
MARY: remember the alamo! remember the alamo!
STAN: mary... please. this is hurting people.
MARY: i don't want to hurt people. but these things happened! all these little sadnesses, the big ones. what if no one remembers? what does that do to the world? someone has to remember, stan.

SAD WOMAN'S VOICE: i was by myself in the park because my friend davia was sick that day. i was on a swing. there was this smiling man walking a little bushy dog -- 
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE: the man said something like, "he's friendly --"
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE: "-- he won't bite."
MAN: he won't bite. you can pet him if you want...
MAN: do you want to give him a biscuit?
MAN: they're in my car. why don't you --
DISTRAUGHT WOMAN'S VOICE: excuse me? hello?

MARY: may i help you? 
DISTRAUGHT WOMAN: i'm here for dr. mierzwiak. my name is helene kernfeld.
MARY: yes, please have a seat. the doctor will be with you momentarily.
MARY: howard, your 10:30.
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE: he took me to his car and ...

OLD MAN: how are you today, mary? 
OLD WOMAN: let's see... still dying, howard.
OLD MAN: you don't have to jump down my throat. i was trying to be nice.
OLD WOMAN: well, don't try. it's unbecoming on you.
OLD WOMAN: may i help you?
SECOND OLD WOMAN: i'd like to make an appointment.
OLD WOMAN: i think the doctor is free this morning. he can probably take you right away for an initial consultation. the second old woman smiles gratefully.

OLD WOMAN: dr. mierzwiak, this is clementine kruczynski. she'd like to talk to you. 
OLD MAN: hello, ms. kruczynski. nice to meet you. please have a seat.
OLD MAN: would you mind if i tape our discussion?
OLD MAN: so, why don't you begin by telling me why you've come here.
SECOND OLD WOMAN: well, i met this man, joel, three years ago at a senior dance... we'd both been alone for so long and...

SECOND OLD WOMAN: -- i said something like we should go upstate and see the leaves change... 
SECOND OLD WOMAN: he just stared at me as if i didn't exist. as if i had never existed...
