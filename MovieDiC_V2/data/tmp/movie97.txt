CUSTOMER: it's the price --
BUCK: i have this unit at home.
CUSTOMER: . . . really . . . ?
BUCK: yes. but -- i've got it modified with the tk421, which is a bass unit that basically kicks in another two, maybe three quads when you really crank -- lemme put another eight track in so you can get a better idea what i'm talkin about --
BUCK: hear that bass? it kicks and turns and curls up in your belly, makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right? if you get this unit as it is -- it won't sound like this without the modification -- and we do that for a small price.
CUSTOMER: thank you for your time.

AMBER: what special skills do you have?
DIRK: well, i spent three years in the marines. i just got back from a tour of duty.
AMBER: you're kidding?
DIRK: no i'm not. it got really hard being surrounded by guys all day.
AMBER: when was the last time you had a woman?
DIRK: a long time.
AMBER: that's terrible.
DIRK: but i'm back now and i'm ready to pursue my acting career.
AMBER: well as you may or may not know, this is an important film for me. if it's not a hit, i'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment. my landlord is a real jerk.
DIRK: really?
AMBER: why don't you take your pants off?
DIRK: no problem.

AMBER: i think that you have the part, but why don't i make sure of something . . . 16mm camera's pov: 
AMBER: this is a giant cock.
JACK: guys . . .
DIRK: is everything cool?

JACK: that was great. 
LITTLE BILL: yes it was. what do you want to do about the come shot? we could go to the stock footage -- get a close up --
JACK: it's not gonna match, we don't have a that big on film --
DIRK: jack?
JACK: yes, dirk?
DIRK: i can do it again if you need a close-up. everyone in the room looks at dirk. hold.

KURT LONGJOHN: is the movement of the waterbed a problem? 
DIRK: not at all, kurt. matter of fact, i dig it.

AMBER: please let me talk to him, tom. please. i just want to say hello 
AMBER: i don't know what to do now.

BUCK: if you were to open a business specializing in, like, super-super hi-fi stereo equipment -- forget it, you're in the money. i mean, there's no limit to the technology that's comin' out now -- 
AMBER: really?
BUCK: that's a fact.
AMBER: so what's wrong with this radio?
BUCK: i think it's . . . uh . . . it's a wattage problem . . . yeah . . . we've got too many watts per channel going into the front two speaker . . . yeah . . .

JACK: -- what else? 
DIRK: that's it for now. i mean: i look at this character holmes has come up with -- and -- look -- i just --
JACK: tell me.
DIRK: i don't like to see women treated that way. this guy he plays, "johnny wad," it's always about slapping some girl around or whatever. it's not right, it's not cool and it just . . . isn't sexy. it isn't like it should be.
REED: we could make it more of a james bond character. this guy that's world traveled.
JACK: i like that.
DIRK: reed could play my partner.
JACK: i like this a lot.
DIRK: we could make it really good, jack. honestly. if you direct it . . . we could make a whole series, with a whole story.
JACK: i know it. i know it.
REED: we should do this.
JACK: alright. when we get back. we'll set up the typewriter and we'll see what we can come up with. i'll talk to the colonel when we get to vegas. but dirk, you gotta work on him too, okay?
DIRK: right, right.
JACK: -- if we don't put every element into this, it's just not gonna work --
DIRK: exactly.
JACK: now: what's this guy's name?
DIRK: his name is brock landers.
REED: his partner's name is chest rockwell.
JACK: . . . those are great names.

JESSIE: shot of tequila, straight up. 
MAURICE: yes, ma'am.
JESSIE: i've been in this place twenty minutes, just to get a seat.
DIRK: you alone?
JESSIE: yeah. just visiting l.a. some people told me the food in here was really good.
DIRK: good. no, it's not good. it's probably the best place to eat in los angeles.
JESSIE: i certainly hope so. i could die of

DIRK: you said you were hungry -- 
JESSIE: starving.
DIRK: well, go ahead and feast.
JESSIE: ohhh. it's true --
DIRK: what?
JESSIE: you're brock landers --

DIRK: isn't it beautiful? 
AMBER: you deserve this, baby.
DIRK: this is it -- this is the thing. this is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen in my life -- they get in the car and go for a ride.

DIRK: so we solved the case and the women are safe -- 
REED: just another day.
DIRK: that's right.
REED: c'mon, brock. let's go out and get some of that saturday night beaver --

JACK: this is the best work i've ever done. 
KURT LONGJOHN: it's a real film, jack.
JACK: it feels good.
KURT LONGJOHN: you made it fly.
JACK: this is the one they'll remember me by, baby.

BECKY: . . . right, right . . . 
JEROME: yeah . . . y'know . . . as far as i'm concerned, it's about love. y'know? you love someone and how hard can the world be? i mean, people will come and go and so will problems, and ultimately, if you have love on your side and in your soul, whatsa problem gonna be that takes your attention away? y'understand?
BECKY: i do . . . i do. that's really sweet.
JEROME: my name's jerome.
BECKY: i'm becky.
JEROME: nice to meet 'ya, becky.
BECKY: what do you do?
JEROME: i'm in the auto industry.
BECKY: really?
JEROME: yeah. i'm regional manager for "pep boys."
BECKY: that's great.
JEROME: you've got a nice smile, becky.
BECKY: thank you.
JESSIE: because sometimes i feel like an outsider to the whole thing. y'know . . . i see you and amber and your relationship and i dunno --
DIRK: no, no, jessie. you shouldn't feel like an outsider.
JESSIE: i know my aren't as big and i know my isn't as tight as all the other girls in this industry but i still feel like i've got something that works -- i can paint, too.
DIRK: yes. yes. yes.
JESSIE: i dunno. i was just never really secure. when i was a kid, i was never really secure with myself that much -- i guess that's why
DIRK: i know what you mean, sometimes i'm like, "what am i doing?" "what the is wrong with me?" y'know?
JESSIE: i know, i know.
DIRK: but then . . . i think . . .
JESSIE: -- it's just fun. it's great.
DIRK: it is. it's the best. i mean, look: i couldn't be happier than where i am today, right now, at this moment.
JESSIE: you are so awesome, dirk.
DIRK: who says you don't have a tight pussy?
JESSIE: i don't know. no one, i guess.
SCOTTY J.: so i was all, "what's your problem?" and he was all, "nothing." so i was like . . . really . . . y'know . . . i was pissed, amber. so then i was all, like, "what are you gonna do?" y'know? and he was all, like acting tough, y'know, with his friends around and stuff. so i was just all . . . like . . . "forget it." and i walked away.
AMBER: excuse me, scotty.

FLOYD: the colonel! 
COLONEL: floyd gondolli, great you could make it . . . great . . . great . . . great.
FLOYD: how are you? you look happy.
COLONEL: i'm fine.
FLOYD: meet boys: tommy and pete.
TOMMY/PETE/ANGIE/CYNDI: hi.
COLONEL: hello. happy new year.
FLOYD: these are the next stars . . . the real people in the world.
COLONEL: i think we should do that talk with jack now, whadda 'ya say? maybe iron
FLOYD: let's do it.
FLOYD: tommy-pete-angie-cyndi. uncle floyd is gonna split for a minute to do a little business talk. the colonel and floyd walk away.

DIRK: hey, amber. 
AMBER: what are you talking about out here?
DIRK: nothin'.
AMBER: do you wanna come with me for a little while?
DIRK: where?
AMBER: a surprise, surprise, surprise.
DIRK: let's go.
JESSIE: hey, buck.
BUCK: hey, jessie, how ya doin'?
JESSIE: you sitting alone?

REED: todd parker. 
TODD: rockin' reed rothchild.
REED: you made it --
TODD: yeah . . . yeah. this is an amazing party. chicks everywhere.
REED: you bet.
TODD: i wouldn't mind havin' some of that action over there -- todd points out a bikini party girl.
REED: want me to introduce you?
TODD: sure. introduce her to my lap.
REED: you got off work?
TODD: i don't dance sunday nights.
REED: it's dirk's.
TODD: that car is jammin' -- nosed, racked, dual camms, ten coats of hand gloss, candy apple red laquer -- whoa.

BUCK: i'm pretty happy with it . . . 
JESSIE: . . . it's a great look for you, i think.
BUCK: it's sort of original, i think.
JESSIE: right.
BUCK: what were we talking about before?
JESSIE: um . . . oil painting . . . ?
BUCK: no . . . yes, i mean . . . but we were talkin' about . . .
JESSIE: oh! oh! "sunsets."

JESSIE: sunrises are better. 
BUCK: exactly.
JESSIE: i thought i was the only one who thought that.
BUCK: i think that.
JESSIE: i never thought we'd have so much in common, buck.
BUCK: yeah, yeah . . . hey, have you ever heard of my stereo system?
JESSIE: no.
BUCK: y'know i'm thinking of opening my own business --
JESSIE: really?
BUCK: it's my dream. hi-fi stereo equipment at a discount price -- it's called "buck's super stereo world."
JESSIE: that's a great idea.

FLOYD: . . . so let's talk about the future. so let's talk about what video means to this industry -- and let's talk about how all of us -- not one of us -- but all of us will profit. i've been doing theater work in san francisco and san diego for as long as you've been doing stag and hardcore, jack. 
JACK: i know you're history, floyd.
COLONEL: no one's doubting your history or your credentials, floyd.
FLOYD: then why the resistance? i mean: this industry is going to be turned upside down soon enough --
JACK: then why help it?
FLOYD: why not be prepared? the money comes from the colonel, the talent comes from you, jack. i've got a connection to the equipment and the mail order distribution, not to mention those kids i got out there who are hot-fuck-action to the max.
JACK: i have a stable of actors and actresses. they're professionals. they're not a bunch of amateurs. they're proven box office and they get people in theaters and they know how to well --
FLOYD: that's right, jack and by that same token, you're the one with the power here. the video revolution is upon us -- and our role is critical. we have an obligation to use our resources and talent to help make it fly --
JACK: you come in here, at my party, tell me about this and that -- tell me about the future, tell me about -- video and amateurs and all that -- well lemme tell you something now: i will not shoot films on video and no i will not loan out my actors who are under contract to me. period.
FLOYD: wait a minute, jack. i'm not a complicated man. i like cinema. in particular, i like to see on film. i don't want to win an oscar and i don't want to re-invent the wheel -- i enjoy simple pleasures like butter in my and lollipops in my mouth. that's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert, but this is something i enjoy. one other small thing i want to do in this life is make a dollar and a cent in this business -- i'm not trying to hurt you. i'm trying to help you stay one step ahead of the game --
JACK: we're repeating ourselves now, floyd.
COLONEL: jack, i think this is about cost and future --
JACK: the future is as bright as we make it -- it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars that can be saved shooting on video tape -- if it looks like and sounds like it probably is --
FLOYD: i think you're one gin past this conversation --
JACK: no . . . no. i'm crystal clear here.
COLONEL: jack, please understand that this is not an argument . . . this is a fact of --
JACK: . . . what . . . ?
COLONEL: this is not an argument, but a --
JACK: what are you saying?
COLONEL: what do you mean, jack, c'mon --
JACK: are you telling me that you're working with this
COLONEL: i think that there is a serious case to be made for the price and the gamble on the whole idea of a home video market -- jack: two, three years from now, everyone's gonna be able to walk into their local supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --
JACK: true film fans won't watch that it doesn't look good and more importantly it doesn't make look sexy.
COLONEL: it doesn't have to look good, jack. film is just too expensive. the theaters are already planning converting to video projectors.
JACK: i haven't heard that.
FLOYD: it's true.
JACK: we've got ten minutes until the new year and i don't want it to start like this so i'm leaving now. we will or we won't continue this conversation some other time.

92 INT. AMBER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT: dirk and amber enter. she sits him on the bed.

ANOTHER YOUNG STUD: this is a fresh pal.

AMBER: . . . what about your character, "brock landers," and what some people 
DIRK: violence . . . ? no, what? i mean, if there's something in this series of movies that's like action or violence or whatever -- that's the movie. y'know? look: i'm not saying that these movies are for the whole family, but they've gotalotta action and sometimes the characters are women who are -- say -- spies or drug smugglers or working for some organization that my character is trying to . . . defeat. we've made twenty of these films in the past

BECKY: you. 
BECKY: ohhh . . . do it again, mayble i'll get my wet next time.

DIRK: block . . . uh . . . an idea or a movement. jack will put the final touches on what the camera needs for editing -- but, uh -- he allows me to block my own scenes. . . . and . . . he gives me flexibility to work with the character and develop, y'know . . . i don't know of any other directors that would let an actor -- uh -- do that. 
JACK: i don't let you block your own scenes. jack and amber laugh. dirk laughs a little less.

JUDGE: and the agreement on the money settlement was taken care of?
LAWYER: yes.
JUDGE: so. what we're talking about then
AMBER: yes.

AMBER: yes.
JUDGE: and why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?

THOMAS: my ex-wife is involved in the business -- i didn't think that environment was a safe place for my son.
