speaker2: . . . at a car wash . . .
speaker3: what?
speaker2: you work at a car wash, school never occurred to you?

speaker1: -- so basically you're gettin' twice the base, cause of the tk421 modification we got in this system here. 
speaker2: i don't know - do i need that much bass?
speaker1: if you want a system to handle what you want -- yes you do. see this system here. this is hi-fi. "high fidelity." what that means is that it's the highest quality fidelity.
speaker2: it's the price --
speaker1: i have this unit at home.
speaker2: . . . really . . . ?
speaker1: yes. but -- i've got it modified with the tk421, which is a bass unit that basically kicks in another two, maybe three quads when you really crank -- lemme put another eight track in so you can get a better idea what i'm talkin about --
speaker1: hear that bass? it kicks and turns and curls up in your belly, makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right? if you get this unit as it is -- it won't sound like this without the modification -- and we do that for a small price.
speaker2: thank you for your time.
speaker1: no problem. the customer exits and jerry approaches buck.
speaker3: . . . the was that?
speaker1: wha?
speaker3: have i told you? huh? have i?

speaker1: the idea is this: amber is a director of films and she's down on her luck. she hasn't had a hit in a year. she's 
speaker2: yes. good dilemma.
speaker1: yes. so she calls up all the agencies in town and says: "send over your best actors, i'm casting a picture." well, the story goes and develops with amber auditioning various men and women . . . the whole thing wraps up with the landlord, i'd like to get jeremy if he's still in town to play the part -- he comes in -- the landlord says: you better pay rent or you're through. well, amber does one helluva job, come in the face, sort of thing and fade out - the end.
speaker2: that's great.
speaker1: there's a kid, a young man, i met him last night: his name is eddie adams. he's here, he's at the party. he's something special and i want to cast him.
speaker2: what films has he done?
speaker1: this would be his first.
speaker2: casting is up to you, jack. you wanna do it? then do it. if it has big tits, tight and focus: i'm happy. you tell the stories you wanna tell, make yourself happy.

speaker5: -- 'cause i'm just trying to give each picture it's own look --

speaker2: when i close my eyes . . . i see this thing, a sign . . . i see this name in bright blue neon lights with a purple outline. and this name is so bright and so sharp that the sign --

speaker1: back to reed and jack. they look at dirk. 
speaker2: heaven sent you here to this place, dirk diggler. you've been blessed.

speaker1: how close? 
speaker2: give me twenty to thirty. i've got a couple tough shadows to deal with --
speaker1: okay, but not too long, kurt, right? remember, there are shadows in real life.

speaker2: it would be better i think, y'know, so we don't break up the momentum or something --
speaker1: amber?
speaker3: good.
speaker1: so we'll just go straight through.
speaker2: okay.
speaker4: are we doing a rehearsal?
speaker1: eddie, you want a rehearsal?

speaker2: yes, ma'am.
speaker3: your agency recommends you very highly.
speaker2: i'm a really hard worker. you give me a job and i won't disappoint you.
speaker3: what special skills do you have?
speaker2: well, i spent three years in the marines. i just got back from a tour of duty.
speaker3: you're kidding?
speaker2: no i'm not. it got really hard being surrounded by guys all day.
speaker3: when was the last time you had a woman?
speaker2: a long time.
speaker3: that's terrible.
speaker2: but i'm back now and i'm ready to pursue my acting career.
speaker3: well as you may or may not know, this is an important film for me. if it's not a hit, i'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment. my landlord is a real jerk.
speaker2: really?
speaker3: why don't you take your pants off?
speaker2: no problem.

speaker1: i think that you have the part, but why don't i make sure of something . . . 16mm camera's pov: 
speaker1: this is a giant cock.
speaker2: guys . . .
speaker3: is everything cool?
speaker2: hang in there, everything's cool, i just wanna change the angle -- you're doin' great.
speaker1: you're doin' so good, dirk.
speaker3: does it feel good?
speaker2: okay -- we're back, we're ready -- action --
speaker4: they're face to face. following in sotto:
speaker1: you're amazing.
speaker3: you feel good, amber.
speaker1: are you ready to come?
speaker3: yes.
speaker1: come in me.
speaker3: what?
speaker1: don't worry, i'm fixed. i want to come in me --

speaker1: that was great. 
speaker2: yes it was. what do you want to do about the come shot? we could go to the stock footage -- get a close up --
speaker1: it's not gonna match, we don't have a that big on film --
speaker3: jack?
speaker1: yes, dirk?
speaker3: i can do it again if you need a close-up. everyone in the room looks at dirk. hold.

speaker1: is the movement of the waterbed a problem? 
speaker2: not at all, kurt. matter of fact, i dig it.

speaker1: please let me talk to him, tom. please. i just want to say hello 
speaker1: i don't know what to do now.

speaker1: if you were to open a business specializing in, like, super-super hi-fi stereo equipment -- forget it, you're in the money. i mean, there's no limit to the technology that's comin' out now -- 
speaker2: really?
speaker1: that's a fact.
speaker2: so what's wrong with this radio?
speaker1: i think it's . . . uh . . . it's a wattage problem . . . yeah . . . we've got too many watts per channel going into the front two speaker . . . yeah . . .

speaker1: -- what else? 
speaker2: that's it for now. i mean: i look at this character holmes has come up with -- and -- look -- i just --
speaker1: tell me.
speaker2: i don't like to see women treated that way. this guy he plays, "johnny wad," it's always about slapping some girl around or whatever. it's not right, it's not cool and it just . . . isn't sexy. it isn't like it should be.
speaker3: we could make it more of a james bond character. this guy that's world traveled.
speaker1: i like that.
speaker2: reed could play my partner.
speaker1: i like this a lot.
speaker2: we could make it really good, jack. honestly. if you direct it . . . we could make a whole series, with a whole story.
speaker1: i know it. i know it.
speaker3: we should do this.
speaker1: alright. when we get back. we'll set up the typewriter and we'll see what we can come up with. i'll talk to the colonel when we get to vegas. but dirk, you gotta work on him too, okay?
speaker2: right, right.
speaker1: -- if we don't put every element into this, it's just not gonna work --
speaker2: exactly.
speaker1: now: what's this guy's name?
speaker2: his name is brock landers.
speaker3: his partner's name is chest rockwell.
speaker1: . . . those are great names.

speaker1: shot of tequila, straight up. 
speaker2: yes, ma'am.
speaker1: i've been in this place twenty minutes, just to get a seat.
speaker3: you alone?
speaker1: yeah. just visiting l.a. some people told me the food in here was really good.
speaker3: good. no, it's not good. it's probably the best place to eat in los angeles.
speaker1: i certainly hope so. i could die of

speaker1: you said you were hungry -- 
speaker2: starving.
speaker1: well, go ahead and feast.
speaker2: ohhh. it's true --
speaker1: what?
speaker2: you're brock landers --

speaker1: isn't it beautiful? 
speaker2: you deserve this, baby.
speaker1: this is it -- this is the thing. this is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen in my life -- they get in the car and go for a ride.

speaker1: so we solved the case and the women are safe -- 
speaker2: just another day.
speaker1: that's right.
speaker2: c'mon, brock. let's go out and get some of that saturday night beaver --

speaker1: this is the best work i've ever done. 
speaker2: it's a real film, jack.
speaker1: it feels good.
speaker2: you made it fly.
speaker1: this is the one they'll remember me by, baby.

speaker1: . . . right, right . . . 
speaker2: yeah . . . y'know . . . as far as i'm concerned, it's about love. y'know? you love someone and how hard can the world be? i mean, people will come and go and so will problems, and ultimately, if you have love on your side and in your soul, whatsa problem gonna be that takes your attention away? y'understand?
speaker1: i do . . . i do. that's really sweet.
speaker2: my name's jerome.
speaker1: i'm becky.
speaker2: nice to meet 'ya, becky.
speaker1: what do you do?
speaker2: i'm in the auto industry.
speaker1: really?
speaker2: yeah. i'm regional manager for "pep boys."
speaker1: that's great.
speaker2: you've got a nice smile, becky.
speaker1: thank you.
speaker3: because sometimes i feel like an outsider to the whole thing. y'know . . . i see you and amber and your relationship and i dunno --
speaker4: no, no, jessie. you shouldn't feel like an outsider.
speaker3: i know my aren't as big and i know my isn't as tight as all the other girls in this industry but i still feel like i've got something that works -- i can paint, too.
speaker4: yes. yes. yes.
speaker3: i dunno. i was just never really secure. when i was a kid, i was never really secure with myself that much -- i guess that's why
speaker4: i know what you mean, sometimes i'm like, "what am i doing?" "what the is wrong with me?" y'know?
speaker3: i know, i know.
speaker4: but then . . . i think . . .
speaker3: -- it's just fun. it's great.
speaker4: it is. it's the best. i mean, look: i couldn't be happier than where i am today, right now, at this moment.
speaker3: you are so awesome, dirk.
speaker4: who says you don't have a tight pussy?
speaker3: i don't know. no one, i guess.
speaker5: so i was all, "what's your problem?" and he was all, "nothing." so i was like . . . really . . . y'know . . . i was pissed, amber. so then i was all, like, "what are you gonna do?" y'know? and he was all, like acting tough, y'know, with his friends around and stuff. so i was just all . . . like . . . "forget it." and i walked away.
speaker6: excuse me, scotty.

speaker1: the colonel! 
speaker2: floyd gondolli, great you could make it . . . great . . . great . . . great.
speaker1: how are you? you look happy.
speaker2: i'm fine.
speaker1: meet boys: tommy and pete.
speaker3: hi.
speaker2: hello. happy new year.
speaker1: these are the next stars . . . the real people in the world.
speaker2: i think we should do that talk with jack now, whadda 'ya say? maybe iron
speaker1: let's do it.
speaker1: tommy-pete-angie-cyndi. uncle floyd is gonna split for a minute to do a little business talk. the colonel and floyd walk away.

speaker1: hey, amber. 
speaker2: what are you talking about out here?
speaker1: nothin'.
speaker2: do you wanna come with me for a little while?
speaker1: where?
speaker2: a surprise, surprise, surprise.
speaker1: let's go.
speaker3: hey, buck.
speaker4: hey, jessie, how ya doin'?
speaker3: you sitting alone?

speaker1: todd parker. 
speaker2: rockin' reed rothchild.
speaker1: you made it --
speaker2: yeah . . . yeah. this is an amazing party. chicks everywhere.
speaker1: you bet.
speaker2: i wouldn't mind havin' some of that action over there -- todd points out a bikini party girl.
speaker1: want me to introduce you?
speaker2: sure. introduce her to my lap.
speaker1: you got off work?
speaker2: i don't dance sunday nights.
speaker1: it's dirk's.
speaker2: that car is jammin' -- nosed, racked, dual camms, ten coats of hand gloss, candy apple red laquer -- whoa.

speaker1: i'm pretty happy with it . . . 
speaker2: . . . it's a great look for you, i think.
speaker1: it's sort of original, i think.
speaker2: right.
speaker1: what were we talking about before?
speaker2: um . . . oil painting . . . ?
speaker1: no . . . yes, i mean . . . but we were talkin' about . . .
speaker2: oh! oh! "sunsets."

speaker1: sunrises are better. 
speaker2: exactly.
speaker1: i thought i was the only one who thought that.
speaker2: i think that.
speaker1: i never thought we'd have so much in common, buck.
speaker2: yeah, yeah . . . hey, have you ever heard of my stereo system?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: y'know i'm thinking of opening my own business --
speaker1: really?
speaker2: it's my dream. hi-fi stereo equipment at a discount price -- it's called "buck's super stereo world."
speaker1: that's a great idea.

speaker1: . . . so let's talk about the future. so let's talk about what video means to this industry -- and let's talk about how all of us -- not one of us -- but all of us will profit. i've been doing theater work in san francisco and san diego for as long as you've been doing stag and hardcore, jack. 
speaker2: i know you're history, floyd.
speaker3: no one's doubting your history or your credentials, floyd.
speaker1: then why the resistance? i mean: this industry is going to be turned upside down soon enough --
speaker2: then why help it?
speaker1: why not be prepared? the money comes from the colonel, the talent comes from you, jack. i've got a connection to the equipment and the mail order distribution, not to mention those kids i got out there who are hot-fuck-action to the max.
speaker2: i have a stable of actors and actresses. they're professionals. they're not a bunch of amateurs. they're proven box office and they get people in theaters and they know how to well --
speaker1: that's right, jack and by that same token, you're the one with the power here. the video revolution is upon us -- and our role is critical. we have an obligation to use our resources and talent to help make it fly --
speaker2: you come in here, at my party, tell me about this and that -- tell me about the future, tell me about -- video and amateurs and all that -- well lemme tell you something now: i will not shoot films on video and no i will not loan out my actors who are under contract to me. period.
speaker1: wait a minute, jack. i'm not a complicated man. i like cinema. in particular, i like to see on film. i don't want to win an oscar and i don't want to re-invent the wheel -- i enjoy simple pleasures like butter in my and lollipops in my mouth. that's me -- call me crazy, call me a pervert, but this is something i enjoy. one other small thing i want to do in this life is make a dollar and a cent in this business -- i'm not trying to hurt you. i'm trying to help you stay one step ahead of the game --
speaker2: we're repeating ourselves now, floyd.
speaker3: jack, i think this is about cost and future --
speaker2: the future is as bright as we make it -- it shouldn't be sacrificed for a few dollars that can be saved shooting on video tape -- if it looks like and sounds like it probably is --
speaker1: i think you're one gin past this conversation --
speaker2: no . . . no. i'm crystal clear here.
speaker3: jack, please understand that this is not an argument . . . this is a fact of --
speaker2: . . . what . . . ?
speaker3: this is not an argument, but a --
speaker2: what are you saying?
speaker3: what do you mean, jack, c'mon --
speaker2: are you telling me that you're working with this
speaker3: i think that there is a serious case to be made for the price and the gamble on the whole idea of a home video market -- jack: two, three years from now, everyone's gonna be able to walk into their local supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --
speaker2: true film fans won't watch that it doesn't look good and more importantly it doesn't make look sexy.
speaker3: it doesn't have to look good, jack. film is just too expensive. the theaters are already planning converting to video projectors.
speaker2: i haven't heard that.
speaker1: it's true.
speaker2: we've got ten minutes until the new year and i don't want it to start like this so i'm leaving now. we will or we won't continue this conversation some other time.

speaker1: dirk and amber enter. she sits him on the bed. 
speaker2: i wanted you . . . to just . . . to come in and give me a minute so i could tell you how much i love you. it's gonna be a new year and we're gonna start things and do things and i want you to know how much i really care for you, honey. i care
speaker3: thank you, amber.
speaker2: you're the best thing in the world that's happened to me since my son
speaker3: i love you too, amber.
speaker2: 1980 . . . y'know? can you believe it?
speaker3: i can't . . . it's like . . . next thing we know . . . it's gonna be 1990, then 2000 . . . can you imagine?
speaker2: goodbye to 1979 . . . hello to 1980 . . .
speaker3: . . . wh . . . ?
speaker2: really fast, like this . . .
speaker3: it burns.
speaker2: it's good, though, right?
speaker3: it's in my throat . . . uch . . .
speaker2: it's the drip . . . the drip's the best part.
speaker3: tastes like aspirin.
speaker2: do one more in the other nostril.
speaker3: . . . i need a glass of water, i think . . .
speaker2: one more, then the water.
speaker3: do i look cool when i do it?

speaker1: hey, dirk. 
speaker2: scotty. hey. what's up, man?
speaker1: . . . new year's, y'know, right?

speaker1: right. did you see my new car? 
speaker2: you got a new car?
speaker1: yeah. wanna see?
speaker2: sure.
speaker3: hey, dirk, c'mere and meet someone.
speaker2: how are ya?
speaker4: we finally meet.
speaker3: remember i told you about todd? he works over at the party boys strip club --
speaker2: oh, cool, cool. you're a dancer?
speaker4: yeah, i got some moves.
speaker1: -- dirk? are you coming -- ?
speaker2: yeah, okay, scotty. i'll see you around. we can talk later.
speaker1: this is it.
speaker2: cool.
speaker1: wanna get inside?
speaker2: when did you get this?
speaker1: yesterday.
speaker2: it's great. it's really great.
speaker1: yeah, you wanna take a ride, or --
speaker2: wait a minute, wait a minute,
speaker1: six minutes . . .
speaker2: oh, let's get back inside, come on --
speaker1: i'm sorry, dirk. please. i'm sorry.
speaker2: . . . why'd you do that?
speaker1: you look at me sometimes --
speaker2: -- what?
speaker1: i wanna know if you like me.
speaker2: . . . yeah . . . scotty.
speaker1: can i kiss you?
speaker2: . . . scott . . . i don't --
speaker1: -- can i kiss your mouth?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: i'm really sorry. i didn't mean to grab you . . . i didn't --
speaker2: it's alright.
speaker1: . . . i'm sorry . . .
speaker2: . . . it's alright.
speaker1: do you wanna kiss me?
speaker2: scotty.
speaker1: no, no. forget it. i'm sorry. i'm really sorry, i'm just drunk.
speaker2: . . . yeah --
speaker1: i'm just crazy, you know? crazy. right? i'm so wasted, drunk, drunk --
speaker2: you wanna go back inside?
speaker1: do you like my car, dirk?
speaker2: what . . . ? yeah. yeah.
speaker1: i wanted to make sure you thought it was cool or else i was gonna take it back.
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: i love you, dirk.

speaker1: you should be taking notes, little bill. 
speaker2: this is a fresh pal.

speaker1: . . . what about your character, "brock landers," and what some people 
speaker2: violence . . . ? no, what? i mean, if there's something in this series of movies that's like action or violence or whatever -- that's the movie. y'know? look: i'm not saying that these movies are for the whole family, but they've gotalotta action and sometimes the characters are women who are -- say -- spies or drug smugglers or working for some organization that my character is trying to . . . defeat. we've made twenty of these films in the past

speaker1: you. 
speaker1: ohhh . . . do it again, mayble i'll get my wet next time.

speaker1: block . . . uh . . . an idea or a movement. jack will put the final touches on what the camera needs for editing -- but, uh -- he allows me to block my own scenes. . . . and . . . he gives me flexibility to work with the character and develop, y'know . . . i don't know of any other directors that would let an actor -- uh -- do that. 
speaker2: i don't let you block your own scenes. jack and amber laugh. dirk laughs a little less.

speaker1: for dirk diggler, the future is something to look forward to, not to fear . . . he is a creative man of many interests . . . film, 
speaker1: it's my poem to you.
speaker2: it's great. it's so great, amber. you're a director now.
speaker1: just you. i wanted to show you first.
speaker2: it's so good. really. maybe you might want to think about cutting that part when jack says that thing about -- y'know --
speaker1: blocking the --
speaker2: -- yeah.

speaker1: how was it? 
speaker1: hello? colonel? wait, wait, wait. yes. calm down. calm down. okay. right now -- yes -- right now.

speaker1: i believe you. 
speaker2: i told her not to do so much coke, but she wouldn't listen, she just kept doing it and doing it like she was a vacuum. like she had a vacuum in her nose or something . . . . . . . next thing i know . . . she's got blood
speaker1: what?
speaker2: it was coming out her ass, jack.
speaker1: okay. it's gonna be okay. just relax. the bail is a hundred thousand dollars.
speaker2: -- i don't have any money left.
speaker1: what do you mean? nothing?
speaker1: well . . . what . . . how?
speaker2: i spent it . . . i spent it.
speaker1: the films . . . or . . . i mean?
speaker2: i spent it, alright? this gets expensive. between you shooting film, the coke, the limos, the houses.
speaker1: alright, okay. don't worry.
speaker2: i can't have this happen to me.
speaker1: yes you are.
speaker2: i didn't know -- i didn't know she was gonna die right there with me or i wouldn't have picked her up.
speaker1: right. you know; you've done nothing wrong. i mean, look; you were just there, right?
speaker2: they found something in my house, jack.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: . . . something . . .
speaker1: . . . what are you saying? what did they find?
speaker2: . . . it's my weakness, jack.
speaker1: christ, colonel.
speaker2: you look at me like i'm an asshole, now.
speaker1: . . . i . . . i don't . . . ?
speaker2: i'm going to jail for a long time.
speaker1: -- it's okay, colonel. it's gonna be fine in the end . . . . i promise . . .
speaker2: are you promising me?

speaker1: listen to me, jack: and i'm gonna tell you this for you. am i your friend? 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: answer me, am i your friend?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: so remember that i'm your friend and listen to what i tell you now: give in, jack. you've gotta give. for you, for your business and your livelihood -- accept the future. don't fight it, because you can't win. look for the new blood, go to floyd gondolli, go to video, give up your battle -- the filmmaking is over, jack.

speaker1: well there we go. 
speaker2: yeah.
speaker3: lot of stuff on there to learn.
speaker1: that's it.
speaker2: no turning back now.
speaker1: the future.
speaker2: that's right.
speaker3: the quality is, uh --
speaker1: it's not what we're used to.
speaker2: we can make it work, i think.
speaker3: it's . . . potential . . .
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: you can't beat the price.
speaker2: no you can't.
speaker1: this is the future and we can't deny it anymore because the past is too expensive.
speaker2: i'm scared.
speaker3: me too.
speaker1: it's gonna make us rich.
speaker2: yep.
speaker3: it's a rather pretty thing, isn't it?
speaker2: we can still tell good stories, jack.
speaker1: no. it's about jacking off now, kurt.

speaker1: i do. 
speaker2: i do too.

speaker1: they made jerome regional manager of the new "pep boys," they're building in bakersfield. we're gonna move there. 
speaker2: that's great, guys. that's so great.
speaker3: it's gonna be a great opportunity to run the store my way. y'know. get those guys off my back and run the store my way.

speaker1: . . . and it's tough is what i'm saying. 
speaker2: right.

speaker1: dirk, meet johnny doe . . . new kid on the block. he's interested in the business.
speaker1: he's pretty tired, johnny. he's also shy. anyway: what i'm saying to you is this: it costs money, you got ten, fifteen people standing around, and that's just to make sure the lighting is right --

speaker1: this stuff burns. 
speaker2: it's crystal.
speaker1: that's why. why didn't you tell me -- you don't need to do that much -- you only have to do bumps with crystal.

speaker1: hello. you must be maggie? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: i'm kathleen o'malley. the judge.
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: you have a lawyer with you?
speaker2: no. i don't. i do not.
speaker3: hello, judge.
speaker1: you've been divorced for six years.
speaker2: yes. since 1977.
speaker1: and the agreement on the money settlement was taken care of?
speaker3: yes.
speaker1: so. what we're talking about then
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: what was decided during the divorce?
speaker3: initially, andrew went with his father, and visitation was given to his mother on -- from saturday noon to sunday at seven. with his mother entitled to bring andrew to her home or any reasonable place.
speaker1: was that the understanding?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: and why wasn't that visiting privilege honored?
speaker4: well, it was for a time --
speaker2: i only saw him twice.
speaker4: it said, "reasonable place," and i didn't think a house of drugs and prostitution and was that.
speaker1: i'm sorry, what is it that you --
speaker4: my ex-wife is involved in the business -- i didn't think that environment was a safe place for my son.
speaker2: this is not right. my son was never exposed to pornographic material or drugs or any of these things, my husband just assumed --
speaker4: i saw it with my own eye.
speaker1: did you register this as a complaint?
speaker3: my client didn't officially register, but i think the circumstance called for something immediate -- for the safety of the child.
speaker1: how old is the boy now?
speaker4: he's twelve.
speaker2: he'll be thirteen next month.
speaker1: where do you live now?
speaker4: we live in long beach. i have a job there and my new wife is home with him. you see, the problem is, judge, is that my ex-wife is a sick . . . she is a very sick person and she needs help. she deals in drugs and for a living --
speaker2: i don't do drugs.
speaker3: your honor, she has been in and out of trouble with the law on quite a few occasions regarding this sort of thing.
speaker2: no. no. not anymore

speaker1: ready, ready. ready like freddy.
speaker2: we are on the lookout. that's what we'll call this -- on the lookout. we're just gonna drive on down ventura, heading west, like i said -- and see what we find. maybe we find some new, young stud who wants to take a shot and get hot and heavy with rollergirl back here in the limo -- and we'll capture it on video. this is a first, ladies and gentleman. a first in history. who knows what could happen . . . ?

speaker1: where the is todd? 
speaker2: c'mon, dirk, seriously --

speaker3: this is stupid, jack.
speaker1: i know . . . this isn't working out.
speaker2: that's it?
speaker1: yeah, that's all. sorry for the inconvenience. the college kid pulls his pants on.
speaker2: you got me hard -- you could at least jack me off or something, lady.
speaker3: what the did you say?
speaker2: it's not so cool to leave me with a hard on.
speaker3: you.
speaker2: nice life you've got here. should be proud of what you've become . . .

speaker2: i agree.
speaker1: this guy's name is rahad jackson. he's got more money than and twice as much coke, crack and smack. he'll buy just about anything anybody wants to sell him. he just likes people hanging out at his house and partying.
speaker3: how do you know him?
speaker1: he used to come into party boys once in a while. mutrix introduced me --
speaker3: and how would we do it, exactly?
speaker1: it's like this: i call him up, tell him i got half a key of quality stuff.
speaker2: do you have his phone number?
speaker1: yeah. so we call him up, give him the price.
speaker3: how much?
speaker1: half a key for like . . . five thousand bucks. split it three ways --
speaker3: that's enough to get my vette fixed.
speaker1: that's right. so we set up the deal, dump half a kilo of baking soda in a bag and walk over to his house -- boom. right there -- this could be a nifty bit o' hustle-bustle.
speaker2: do you have his address?
speaker1: fuckin', reed, yeah i have his address, c'mon.
