SIMON: we can be in mexico by noon. i say we split up from there. i'll take baja.
MARCUS: mexico. we're going home. to l.a.

VICTOR: tommy, it's vic. i need you to run a credit card for me. you ready? 
VICTOR: first name `todd.' last name `gaines.'
G-A-I-N-E-S.: vic jr. looks to his dad.

CLAIRE: don't. 
SIMON: why not?
CLAIRE: she's been on for fourteen hours.
MALE VOICE #1: i'm not the man you're looking for.
MALE VOICE #2: we both know you were on the pier. you saw what happened to carmen.

ZACK: don't forget, detective. i was cleared of all charges. 
ADAM: i don't care how many high-priced lawyers you bring in. eden valley will never stand for your kind of scum.

BURKE: you work out, don't you? 
ADAM: you have to. it's in the contract.
BURKE: no, you have a great body.

BURKE: hey! people in here! 
ZACK: just so we're clear. whether you get something on this guy or not, adam and i are done today. finished. charges dropped. that's how it works, right?
ZACK: what?
BURKE: seems to me, if a guy's so concerned about the legal process, how come he finds himself getting busted for possession? adam and zack share a look. a beat.
BURKE: relax. i sign your form and the whole thing goes away. your lawyer got you a good deal.
ADAM: is it safe to have a radio against my like this?
LOOP: safe enough.

BURKE: tell them what your girlfriend does. 
LOOP: she doesn't do anything.
BURKE: they're not even married and she does nothing. my wife -- we've been married two years -- she still takes overtime three nights a week.

ZACK: i smell a pilot. 
BURKE: you guys got girlfriends? what am i saying? you gotta lot of girlfriends don't you? you got women sending you their panties. two good- looking guys... what do you say?
LOOP: magnets.
BURKE: if i was not a happily married man i would be rubbing up against you to get some of that. some of the power. zack offers loop a napkin. he passes.
ADAM: actually, i'm settled down. four years now.
LOOP: no ring.
ADAM: nothing legal.
BURKE: how about you?
ZACK: same.
BURKE: this is a crime. you two should be out getting laid.

ADAM: star light, star bright first star that i see tonight... 
ADAM [CONT'D, FILTERED]: ...i wish i may, i wish i might...
BURKE: that's good. i'm getting him.
BURKE: so, zack. what does your girlfriend look like?
ZACK: about five-eight, brown hair, blue eyes.
BURKE: hot.
ZACK: yeah.
BURKE: she faithful?
ZACK: no. i don't think so.
BURKE: you faithful?
ZACK: not anymore.

BURKE: zack's girlfriend is around on him. 
LOOP: man, i'm sorry. how did you find out?
ZACK: it's no big...i don't really want to get into it.
LOOP: c'mon, tell us.
ADAM: absolutely. tell us.
ZACK: i found socks.
BURKE: what, red socks, blue socks?
ZACK: white socks. you know how the good kind of socks have band around the ankle that keeps them from stretching out? when i moved in, every one of the socks had that.
BURKE: you hear that? we got john sherlock holmes in the car here.
THE GROCERY STORE.: adam turns on zack.

ADAM: alright. but you've been around, too. 
ZACK: only after i found out.
ADAM: huh.

ADAM: so, zack. do you know who your girlfriend's 
ZACK: no, adam. i do not. i have suspicions. mostly former boyfriends who keep calling.
ADAM: what a coincidence. i have the exact same problem with my girlfriend. in fact, i think she's been sleeping around on me, too.
ZACK: isn't it ironic.
ADAM: don't you think?
CLAIRE: gay men are so hot. it's tragic.

ADAM: he's not here. what are we supposed to do? he's not here. 
ZACK: we're going to ask. you're going to ask.
ADAM: why me?
ZACK: you look more wholesome. just improv.
ADAM: who are you calling?
ZACK: nobody. i'm giving you an opening.

ADAM: he wasn't there. the british guy, he wasn't there. 
LOOP: no, we heard. you guys did great.
BURKE: this chick... ronna. you think she can score?
ADAM: maybe.
ZACK: probably.

ZACK: so if she gets the stuff, what, you arrest her? 
BURKE: we try to bring her over. see, we arrest her and then what? one crack off the street. so we cut her a deal. she helps us get this guy. we cut him a deal. he helps us get the guy above him. it's just like what happened with you.
ZACK: so, sooner or later, everybody's working for the man.
BURKE: exactly.

84A.: "go" 8/26/98 revisions 
LOOP: she's coming up.

ZACK: what if she isn't really a dealer though? if you just pulled her into this one thing, wouldn't that be entrapment? 
BURKE: if she's making this deal, she's a dealer. doesn't matter if its her first or her last. we stay on zack, unconvinced.

BURKE: cerveza? 
ADAM: oh yeah. hey. we bought a whole bunch of orange juice. it's in the car.
BURKE: now, zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that right?
RONNA: you got a bathroom?
ADAM: down the hall on the right.
ZACK: let me show you...

BURKE: now watch what i do with his wrist. i twist it away while i put on the second cuff. that way he can't go after me. he doesn't have any leverage. 
BURKE: i watch all these cop shows and they never do it right. me off.
BURKE: hey, feel the abs on this one.
BURKE: you could scrub laundry on these.
LOOP: full hands.
BURKE: what?
LOOP: nothing. i'm out of it. merry christmas, guys. good to meet you.

BURKE: you did your part. 
BURKE: now that he's gone, there's something i wanted to ask you guys about. sort of a proposition. see, my wife and i -- irene, she's my wife -- we're both working on christmas so we're gonna have christmas dinner tonight. and i was thinking, maybe you guys would want to come over, eat some dinner with us. my wife is great, you'll love her, then i'll sign your form. how does that sound?
ZACK: actually, you know, i had plans.
ADAM: you did?
ZACK: i do.
ADAM: with your girlfriend?
ZACK: yes, adam, in fact. with my girlfriend.
ADAM: huh. wow, i can't believe i forgot this. i saw your girlfriend this morning, and she asked me to tell you that she couldn't make your plans tonight.

IRENE: yes? hi? 
ADAM: sorry. phone. messages. check?
IRENE: here.

ZACK: sorry. 
BURKE: no, stay for a sec.
BURKE: smell this. what does it smell like?
BURKE: ck one. but it's not.

ZACK: really. 
BURKE: i get this for a quarter what that stuff costs.
ZACK: it's nice.
BURKE: here.
BURKE: it's down. so is the liner.
ZACK: it is soft.
BURKE: get on.
ZACK: that's okay.
BURKE: did you hear that?
ZACK: hear what?
BURKE: exactly. individually wrapped springs. top quality.
BURKE: i could be doing aerobics over here and you wouldn't feel it.
ZACK: i sure wouldn't.

BURKE: so, zack. would you say you're open to new things? 
IRENE: of course you like your job. you get to kiss all those pretty girls.
ADAM: it does have perks.
IRENE: tell me something. when you kiss those girls, you're not really kissing them, are you?
ADAM: it's a stage kiss. your lips touch, but there's no tongue.
IRENE: there's no feeling. nobody gets jealous.
ADAM: it's acting. it's not real.
ADAM: see, now, that. there was a tongue there.
BURKE: honey, red or white?
IRENE: what goes with turkey?

BURKE: more wine? 
ZACK: no. he doesn't want any more. unless he does, do you?
ADAM: no.
ZACK: this has been great, just wonderful, but we're going to need to leave. soon. adam's not feeling well.
ADAM: i'm not. it's true.
BURKE: if you gotta go, then i understand. but irene and i sort of had an ulterior motive inviting you here.
IRENE: he makes it sound sinister. it's not.
BURKE: she's right. okay, you've looked around our place. where do you think we got most of this stuff?
IRENE: just guess.
ADAM: sears?

ZACK: j.c. penney's? 
BURKE: it's actually from confederated products. almost everything in this house is from confederated products, from the toilet paper to the mattress to those candles.
IRENE: the wine.
BURKE: even that cologne you liked. see, confederated products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company. that means we don't just sell the products ourselves, we also recruit and manage teams who work under us. irene and i started eight months ago and we're already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues.
IRENE: we're the number four distributor in southern california. by march, we might be number three.
BURKE: now, as law enforcement officers, irene and i can't recruit distributors from inside the force. it's against the rules and we'd get fired. so what we do is look for people in other industries...
IRENE: ...like the entertainment industry.
ZACK: wait. you want us to sell amway.
BURKE: confederated products. it's a different company, different quality of product.

ZACK: i need to do something terrifically unwholesome. i need to bathe in sin. 
ADAM: with me, or one of your other boyfriends?

ZACK: i have cheated on you with exactly one guy. 
ADAM: ditto.
ZACK: who?
ADAM: no. see, if i tell you, you will freak out and it will be drama. bad not-funny roseanne kind of drama and i am just not up for it.
BY THE REGISTER: they wait in a short line.
ZACK: i'll tell you mine.
ADAM: no.
ZACK: why not?

ADAM: you can't wait to tell me, can you? you're gloating. you think yours is better than mine. 
ZACK: i don't.
ADAM: it's sean connery, isn't it?
ZACK: count of three.
ADAM: alright. sure. wait. okay.

ADAM: jimmy? 
ZACK: jimmy. jimmy.

ADAM: is jimmy here? 
SANDRA: oh my oh. my

SANDRA: i'll call you back. 
SANDRA: you do know, don't you?
ZACK: we know.
SANDRA: i take no responsibilty. i was only an innocent bystander. but there was once where you missed each other by three minutes. it was so exciting.
SANDRA: it's some sort of rave thing.
ZACK: mary xmas supafest.
SANDRA: he left an hour ago.
SANDRA: you're not going to kill him, are you?

ADAM: i know. 
ZACK: mediocre at best. and the sounds he made, it was like having with nell. adam imitates the moan.
ZACK: somewhere off greenland, hunchback whales were beaching themselves.
ADAM: and the ear thing. hello, i have q-tips. that's really not necessary.
ZACK: the only thing i will give him credit for is the oral.
ADAM: what do you mean? he was terrible. at some point i just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. i had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up.
ZACK: when was that?
ADAM: october, maybe?
ZACK: early october. and he suddenly got so much better.
ADAM: that is so disturbing. it's like you were there.

ZACK: right. this right. this right! that was the right you wanted. 
ZACK: what the

ZACK: oh my 
ADAM: it's...it's that girl.
ZACK: ronna.
ZACK: go. go. go!
ADAM: what if she's...
ZACK: go!

ZACK: let's think about it logically. either she's alive, or she's dead. if she's dead, then there's nothing we can do. if she's alive, then the guy with the gun, who seemed to want to shoot her, probably did shoot her. 
ADAM: so even if she's alive, she's dead.
ZACK: exactly.
ZACK: on the plus side, the only witnesses are you, me and him. and none of us are going to want to be talking about it. so if you really think about it, it didn't turn out as badly as it could have.
ADAM: a girl is dead.
ZACK: i didn't say it went perfectly.

ZACK: holy sh... 
ZACK: they wouldn't have been listening all this time.
ADAM: hello, they could have been recording it. everything we said could be on tape somewhere. they would know we did it. a beat.
ZACK: there's a pretty good chance no one's found her yet.
ADAM: they will.

ZACK: stop. okay, stop! 
ADAM: what?
ZACK: it's a miata.
ZACK: we'll put her in the passenger seat.
ADAM: where will i...or you...
ZACK: in the passenger seat. holding her up. adam shudders at the thought.
ZACK: little help?
ADAM: i can't.
ZACK: what do you mean?

ADAM: i can't do this. 
ZACK: okay, listen to me...
ADAM: she's dead.
ZACK: she's not dead.
ADAM: she's dead. i hit her and i killed her.
ZACK: no you didn't, okay? this is all just make-believe. this is a scene. she's just acting dead. and you're just acting scared.
ZACK: see, there's the lights, and there's the camera. watch your blocking. there's michelle in wardrobe, say "hi, michelle!"
ADAM: hi, michelle.
ZACK: the craft service truck is right around the corner, and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill. and you can have one if you just help me finish this scene. can you smell them? can you smell them on the grill?
ADAM: i'm not delusional.

ZACK: then take her arms! 
ADAM: she's not dead.
ZACK: no
ADAM: if she's not dead, that means we didn't kill her. we can just leave her.
ZACK: she's almost dead. we leave her and she dies, why did we bother coming back? i mean, you still killed her.
ADAM: what do you mean, i killed her?
ZACK: christ, i didn't mean it that way. c'mon. i would never testify against you. adam is not reassured.
ZACK: we have to stick with plan a.
ADAM: in plan a she was dead.

104.: "go" 8/26/98 revisions 
ZACK: okay. new plan.

CAR ALARM VOICE: back away from the vehicle. 
FILA GUY: hey, it's kelly. somebody beat the out of her.
SKATE-PUNK GUY: somebody call an ambulance!

ZACK: look, she's fine. they're getting an ambulance. she's fine. 
ADAM: what about that guy? the guy with the gun. he could still go after her.

ZACK: okay, listen. girl in ditch -- that's our problem. girl out of ditch -- that's her own problem. we're done. we did the right thing. thunder rumbles overhead. off adam's look... 
ZACK: okay, approximately the right thing. in a half-assed, thrown-together fashion.
ZACK: home?
ADAM: home.

WAITER: anywhere you want. 
CLAIRE: i'm meeting people.
CLAIRE: hey.
GAINES: hey.
CLAIRE: we're twins.
CLAIRE: i'll pay you back for breakfast. don't worry. i'm not really that hungry.

CLAIRE: have you seen ronna? or mannie? 
CLAIRE: see, when we go out, we always meet here afterwards in case we get separated.

106.: "go" 8/26/98 revisions 
CLAIRE: unless you wanted to eat alone.
GAINES: no. it's fine.

CLAIRE: what do you have against the family circus? 
GAINES: it's evil.
CLAIRE: besides that.
GAINES: okay. location mostly. bottom right corner, just waiting there to suck. it's the last thing you read, and it spoils everything you read before it.
CLAIRE: you could just not read it.
GAINES: i hate it, yet i'm uncontrollably drawn to it. are you going to...
CLAIRE: do you know what i like about you?

GAINES: what? 
CLAIRE: i'm asking. i don't know. it's not your face, because you're only medium cute. i think what it is, is you might be the first non-fake person i've met here.
GAINES: me.
CLAIRE: i'm serious.
GAINES: professional curiousity. what are you on?
CLAIRE: ginseng and lotsa caffeine. gaines leaves money for the check.

CLAIRE: you know what i like best about christmas? the surprises. it's like, you get this box, and you're sure you know what's in it. you shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. no doubt in your mind. but then you open it up, and it's something completely different. bing! wow! bang! surprise! i mean, it's like you and me here. she smiles. she has a bewitching smile. 
CLAIRE: i'm not saying this is anything it's not. but, c'mon. this time yesterday, who'dda thunk it?

GAINES: simon's apartment is around the back -- the gate's always open. now, you're going to take sunset to hyperion. 
GAINES [CONT'D]: at hillhurst, you have to keep right -- you want sunset boulevard, not sunset drive.

VICTOR: do it. 
CLAIRE: wait! stop! stop! you can't do this! you won't get away with it!
CLAIRE [CONT'D]: hello, witness.
CLAIRE [CONT'D]: what is wrong with you people? do you think this is an effective way of dealing with problems?
VICTOR: this shot my boy.

SIMON: ...in the arm. 
CLAIRE: so, what? you're going to kill three people? what do you actually want?
VICTOR: justice.

SIMON: it's all flesh here, it should be okay. 
SIMON: right, great.
VIC JR.: i can't.

SIMON: it's all right. really. 
GAINES: where are you going?
CLAIRE: i gotta get to work.
VICTOR: look, now the girl's leaving.
SIMON: see you, claire. we follow her out the door. as she exits...
GAINES: be good!

RONNA: okay, real mature. 
RONNA: claire.
RONNA: alright. mistakes were made. things didn't go exactly as planned.
RONNA [CONT'D]: but it wasn't exactly a banner night for me, either.
CLAIRE: you are constantly using us.
RONNA: using you? you use me. come on, if it weren't for me, you would be sitting home every night eating popcorn and watching reruns of 90210.
CLAIRE: mannie is your chauffeur, and i am... i am some chick you leave sitting in an apartment.
RONNA: that is such mannie does not feel that way. ask him. ask him! where is he?
CLAIRE: why would i know?

RONNA: he drove you here, didn't he? 
CLAIRE: no, i got a ride. his car was still in the parking lot when i left.
RONNA: oh

RONNA: mannie! can you hear me? 
MANNIE: yeah!
MANNIE: you look like

CLAIRE: no! we made out. 
RONNA: made out?
CLAIRE: kissed. a little. what?
RONNA: hello! he's a drug dealer.

MANNIE: dain brambage?
MANNIE: xavier kugat. starts with x.
RONNA: you

RONNA: merry christmas, mannie.

SIMON: who is it? 
MALE VOICE [O.S.]: it's todd.
SIMON: todd. thank you won't believe the i've been through...

JIMMY SHUBERT: somethin' about it just didn't add up. so last night i went back to the pier to do some investigating of my own. turns out there are two boats named the princess. only, one just got back from two weeks at sea -- sal dominico's boat. it got me thinkin' -- if chase really did know carmen was on to him, how come he didn't tell lucas, or gamble, or myerson? why would he drive up to pinecliff by himself? and why would you still have his briefcase? answer me that, danielle. if you have an answer. music rises, a scene cut. 
ZACK: i'm not the man you're looking for.
ADAM: we both know you were on the pier. you saw what happened to carmen.
ZACK: don't forget, detective. i was cleared of all charges.
ADAM: i don't care how many high-priced lawyers you bring in. eden valley will never stand for your kind of scum.
