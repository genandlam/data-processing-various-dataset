STEVE: mr. jenning couldn't find you, so he gave it to me to give to you. he said he's sorry it's so late, but it's the first scholarship the moose lodge has given out. oh yeah, he says they're all very proud of you. 
CURT: well... ah... why don't you hold onto it for a while?
STEVE: what's with you? it's yours! take it! i don't want it.
TERRY: i'll take it.
CURT: steve... ah, i think we'd better have a talk. i've gotten-
STEVE: your sister calls. i'll talk to you later.
CURT: now, steve! let her wait.
STEVE: okay, make it short and sweet.

STEVE: you chicken fink.
CURT: wait, let me explain--
STEVE: you can't back out now! after all we went through to get accepted. we're finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell--look, i gotta talk to laurie. now take it. we're leaving in the morning. okay?
STEVE: you wanna end up like john? you can't stay seventeen forever.
CURT: i just want some time to think. what's the rush? i'll go next year.
STEVE: we'll talk later.
RADIO: "here comes the wolfman--wolfman jack!"
WOLFMAN: oh, we're gonna rock and roll ourselves to death baby. you got the wolfman jack show!

GIRL: hi john! 
JOHN: not too good, huh?
CURT: why is it every girl that comes around here is ugly? or has a boyfriend? where is the dazzling beauty i've been searching for all my life?
JOHN: i know what you mean. the pickin's are really gettin' slim. the whole strip is shrinking. ah, you know, i remember about five years ago, take you a couple of hours and a tank full of gas just to make one circuit. it was really somethin.'
CURT: hey, john. someone new in town.
JOHN: ahhh.
CURT: you gonna go after him?
JOHN: hey, listen, professor, if he can't find me, then he ain't worth racin', right?
CURT: the big shot!
BUDDA: a cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate mountain. anything else you want, steve? if there is you let me know now. just honk and i'm yours.
BUDDA: one fries--grab it before i drop it.
STEVE: where was i?
LAURIE: um, how you thought high school romances were goofy and we started going together just because you thought i was kinda cute and funny, but then you suddenly realized you were in love with me, it was serious... and ah... oh, you were leadin' up to somethin' kinda big.
STEVE: you make it sound like i'm giving dictation. well, seriously, what i meant was, that ah... since we do care for each other so much, and since we should really consider ourselves as adults. now, i, ah... could i have a couple of those fries?
STEVE: ah, where was i?
LAURIE: ..."consider ourselves adults"...
STEVE: right... right... anyway, i thought maybe, before i leave, we could ah... agree that... that seeing other people while i'm away can't possibly hurt, you know?
LAURIE: you mean dating other people?
STEVE: i think it would strengthen our relationship. then we'd know for sure that we're really in love. not that there's any doubt.
LAURIE: i think you're right. i mean, we're not kids anymore, and it's silly to think that when we're three thousand miles apart we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out.
STEVE: laurie, now, listen, i didn't ask for that back. i think that...
LAURIE: i know. i just sort of think it's juvenile now. i'll keep it at home. it's less conspicuous there.
STEVE: you don't want to wear it?
LAURIE: i didn't say that. i understand and i'm not upset. i mean, i can't expect you to be a monk or something while you're away.
TERRY: ...and i have a really sharp record collection. i even have "pledging my love" by johnny ace. anyway, how can you love nelson when he's going out with marilyn gator. since he dumped on you maybe we could--
BUDDA: he didn't dump on me, you little dip. hi, steve!
TERRY: she's a little conceited--just playing hard to get.
STEVE: listen, i came over here to talk to you about--
TERRY: any time, buddy. i'm your man. nothing i like better than chewing the rug with a pal. you talk, i'll listen. i'm all ears. shoot.
STEVE: shut up.
TERRY: sure.
STEVE: terry, i'm going to let you take care of my car while we're away--at least until christmas. i'm afraid if i leave it with my--
STEVE: what's wrong?
CURT: hey, sis--what's wrong?
LAURIE: nothing.
STEVE: now listen, only 30 weight castrol- r. i've written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove compartment. are you listening?
CURT: what's wrong, he's crying!
TERRY: i can't... believe... it. i don't know what to say. i'll... love and protect this car until death do us part. this is a superfine machine. this may even be better than daryl starbird's superfleck moonbird. it is better than daryl starbird's.
TERRY: budda, how would you like to go to the drive-in movies with me?
BUDDA: you've got to be kidding!
TERRY: would i kid you about a thing like that? i want you to know that something has happened to me tonight that is going to change everything. i've got a new...
TERRY: car!! all right, who's the wise-- oh, john--verrry funny.
JOHN: hey, did she do that to you?
STEVE: let's get going. it seems like we've spent most of our lives in this parking lot.
TERRY: hey, curt, let's bomb around, i wanna try out my new wheels!
CURT: i'd like to, toad, but i'm going with steve and laurie to the hop. i'd just slow you down anyway.

JOHN: no they don't. i mean, i don't know, maybe they do. but i don't. it's just that you're a little young for me.
CAROL: i am not! if you throw me out i'll scream.
JOHN: ok, ok, just stay cool. there's no need to scream. we'll think of something. it shouldn't take too long to find your sister again.

WENDY: mr. beeman's not so old.
CURT: what cruel fate keeps me from my true love? how am i ever going to meet her?
WENDY: did you know that my ex is going to become a presidential aide? it's supposed to be a secret, but his big ambition in life is to shake hands with president kennedy. how are you going to accomplish that at j.c.?
CURT: maybe i've grown up. maybe i've changed my mind.
WENDY: maybe you don't think you can do it!
CURT: maybe you should shut up!
WENDY: maybe i will... and maybe i won't.
CURT: why don't you move your bod into aft chamber, where we might discuss this in private.
BOBBIE: thanks a lot.
CURT: come on, wendy? she doesn't say anything. they pull up to a stoplight. wendy looks at the red stoplight and then abruptly gets out of the car and jumps in the back.
WENDY: well, slide over, i'm not sitting on your lap. she gets in and the car goes off.
CURT: to the opera, james.
BOBBIE: drop dead.
CURT: unless you want to go to gallo dam and have an orgy.

TERRY: no... hey, but no sweat. what'll it be? beer, little wine?
DEBBIE: if you could get some old harper, i'd give you a french kiss.
TERRY: old harper, rrright! he gives her an ok sign with his fingers and goes over to the store. he starts to enter, then stops and thinks. he sees a man in a business suit approaching, and smiles.
TERRY: excuse me, sir, while you're in there-- i mean, since you're going in anyway, i wonder if--
MAN: yes, son?
TERRY: could you--sir--could you give me the time?
MAN: why sure, it's a quarter to twelve.
TERRY: great. quarter to twelve. thanks a lot.
TERRY: pardon me, sir, but i lost my i.d. in--in a flood and i'd like to get some old harper, hard stuff. would you mind buying a bottle for me?

DEBBIE: hey, did ya get it? ya get it, ya get it? 
DEBBIE: you got it. you got it!
DEBBIE: you didn't get it. why didn't you get it?
TERRY: ah, well, i needed some things and i thought as long as i was in there-- look, debbie, can you loan me a dollar?
DEBBIE: what? are you for real? come on. girls don't pay. guys pay.
TERRY: yeah, well, see--i've only got a fifty and he doesn't have change.

TERRY: hi--excuse me. i was wondering--could you, ah--
GUY: buy you a bottle of booze. yeah, i know. you lost your i.d. what kind do you want?

JOHN: that's freddy benson's vette... he got his head on with some drunk. never had a chance. good driver, too. what a waste when somebody gets it and it ain't even their fault. 
CAROL: needs a paint job, that's for sure.
JOHN: that vette over there. walt hawkins, a real ding-a-ling. wrapped it around a fig tree out on mesa vista with five kids in it. draggin' with five kids in the car, how can you get? all the ding-a-lings get it sooner or later. maybe that's why they invented cars. to get rid of the ding-a-lings. tough when they take someone with them.
CAROL: you never had a wreck though--you told me.
JOHN: i come pretty close a couple of times. almost rolled once. so far i've been quick enough to stay out of here. the quick and the dead.
CAROL: i bet you're the fastest.
JOHN: i've never been beaten--lot of punks have tried. see that '41 ford there? used to be the fastest wheels in the valley. i never got a chance to race old earl. he got his in '55 in the hairiest crash ever happened around here. he was racing a '54 chevy, bored and loaded, out on the old oakdale highway and every kid in town was out there. the chevy lost its front wheel doing about 85. the had torched the spindles to lower the front end and it snapped right off. he slammed bam into the ford and then they both of them crashed into a row of cars and all those kids watchin! eight kids killed including both drivers, looked like a battlefield. board of education was so impressed they filmed it. show it now in drivers education, maybe you'll see it. anyway, since then street racing's gone underground. no spectators, i mean. too bad.
CAROL: i'd love to see you race.
JOHN: come on! none of that.
CAROL: whadaya mean? i'm the one who's supposed to say that. whadaya afraid of? i'll keep it above the waist.
JOHN: funny... who knows, in a few years--but not now, bunny rabbit.
CAROL: bunny rabbit! oh brother, you are such a drip.
JOHN: come on, open the door.
CAROL: if you say "carol's not a bunny, she's a foxy little tail."
JOHN: carol's not a rabbit, she's a foxy little tail.
CAROL: you say the cutest things.

JOE: no, he don't. i seen the station right outside of town.
CARLOS: that's just a clearing station, man. so he can fool the cops. he blasts that thing all the way around the world. it's against the law, man.
ANTS: ah, man--they'll never catch the wolfman.
ANTS: hey, man, who cut the cheese?
JOE: he who smelt it, dealt it. hey, creep, scoot down. sitting up like that, it wrecks the lines of the car, you know what i mean?
JOE: there's that badass chevy again. look at he he's got with him.

DEBBIE: it's the living end.
TERRY: yeaah, i guess it wasn't mixed.
DEBBIE: wow, it's pretty tonight. it's a perfect night to go horseback riding-- i was going with a guy once who had a horse.
TERRY: oh yeah? i used to have a couple of horses myself.
DEBBIE: really?
TERRY: i used them for hunting. i do a lot of hunting. deer mostly, although i got a couple of bear last year. yep, they were good ponies--hunting ponies. i had to train 'em special, you know.
DEBBIE: do you still have 'em? we could go for a ride.
TERRY: no, i had to sell 'em. to get these wheels... and a jeep. i also have a jeep pick-up, with four-wheel drive. it's got a gun rack. and i use that for hunting mostly.
DEBBIE: why do you kill little animals? i think that's terrible.
TERRY: oh, well, yeah, i figure with bears, though, it's either me or them... you know, i think you're really neat.
DEBBIE: wait a second.
TERRY: oh, jeez, i'm sorry. i don't know what got into me--i didn't mean to-- maybe it's the booze or something.

MR. GORDON: tomorrow. well, listen, hank anderson's inside. come in and say goodbye. you know, hank's the one that brought your name up on the floor of the moose hall. you got the check, didn't you?
HANK: we are all proud of you, curt. the moose scholarship couldn't have gone to a better boy. and if there's anything we can do, let us know.
MR. GORDON: yeah, you'll stay in touch by letter, won't you?
JOE: hey, we're all done out here.

HANK: some day he'll make a fine moose.

DEBBIE: what's wrong? 
TERRY: i thought i heard something.
VOICE: they're porking in the weeds. no sweat.
TERRY: wait a minute!
DEBBIE: what?
TERRY: the radio is gone... that means--the car is gone!
TERRY: oh no!!! oh no!!!
TERRY: oh god--i'm sorry. but, why the car? you could have struck us with lightning or something--anything--- but not the car!

LAURIE: you know, it doesn't make sense to leave home to look for a home, to give up a life to find a new life, to say goodbye to friends you love just to find new friends. 
STEVE: what? say that again, i didn't--
LAURIE: that's what curt said.
STEVE: oh, figures. you must've talked his ear off trying to get him to stay.
LAURIE: that's not true. i didn't say anything. curt just said at dinner tonight he realized there was no big hurry. he thought he should take it easy for a while, go to j.c. and try to figure out what he wants to do with his life.
STEVE: that sounds logical.
LAURIE: you think so?
STEVE: sure. i think curt's probably right for curt. not for me though. laurie, look at me. now you know what i want out of life. and it's just not in this town.
LAURIE: i'm not going to the airport tomorrow.
LAURIE: steve! don't.
STEVE: it's our last night together for three months... come on.
LAURIE: we've been through this before.
STEVE: i'm going to miss you so much. i need something to remember you by. you don't want me to forget you.
LAURIE: no...
STEVE: what's wrong? you're just lying there.
LAURIE: well go ahead, you want to.
STEVE: not like that.
LAURIE: if you're not going to remember me for anything else, why don't you go ahead?
STEVE: you want it and you know it. don't be so self-righteous with me. after those things you told me about watching your brother--
LAURIE: you're disgusting! get out of my car! i told you never--
STEVE: i'm sorry.
LAURIE: get out! it's not worth it. i don't care if you're leaving--now get out!

DEBBIE: anyway, the goat killer-- 
TERRY: let's talk about something else.
DEBBIE: --whenever he strikes, he leaves a goat's head near the victim. isn't that creepy?
DEBBIE: they thought he went up to stockton, but two nights ago they found carlie johnson and don white right here by the canal all hacked to pieces and--
TERRY: who do you think'll take the regionals this--
DEBBIE: --not only were there goats' heads, but he had switched all the parts of their bodies around. you know putting her arms on him and his legs on--
TERRY: wait a second. did you hear...?
DEBBIE: you think it's the goat killer?
DEBBIE: come on, we'll hide in the field.
DEBBIE: maybe if it's the goat killer he'll get somebody and we'll see the whole thing.
TERRY: i don't want to see the whole thing. especially if it's us he--oh, why me? i'm going to look lousy with your legs and a goat's head and--
DEBBIE: shhh--he's stopped. i can't see him very--i think he's coming this way.
TERRY: well, as long as he's not--debbie! debbie!
STEVE: terry!
TERRY: who, me? why me?
STEVE: terry.
TERRY: steve!
TERRY: where'd you go, anyway?
DEBBIE: over there.
TERRY: well, don't go off again. come on, let's get out of here.
STEVE: what're you doing out here? hey, where's my rod?
TERRY: um, oh, did i introduce you? this is debbie. debbie, this is steve.
DEBBIE: hello.
STEVE: hi.
DEBBIE: hi.
STEVE: well, what about my car?
TERRY: um... i'ts in the garage. i put it in the garage for safe keeping. i mean... i don't want to take any chances with it.
STEVE: oh, great.
DEBBIE: yeah. yeah. it's a good thing too. 'cause somebody stole our car.
STEVE: really? that's terrible. what kind was it?
TERRY: gee, ah, where's laurie, anyway?
STEVE: i guess we broke up.
TERRY: you broke up? bull!

CAROL: it doesn't look like a gear shift knob. 
JOHN: come on, will ya? give it back to me.
CAROL: well, go ahead, cream me. what's wrong, you're a tough guy. break my arm, see if i care.
JOHN: forget it.
CAROL: i was just going to keep it for a little while. you're an ogre, just like my father. he won't let me play records, or stay out late, or anything.
JOHN: he ah--doesn't like you to stay out late?
CAROL: no--he's terrible. once i was at a party that didn't end till late and he called the cops. can you imagine? it was only a little after midnight and he had the whole police force--
JOHN: say, where do you live anyway?
CAROL: over on ramona, why? oh no. uh uh. you thought i'd tell you where--not me, not old carol. the night is young and i'm not hitting the rack until i get a little action.
CAROL: what do you keep lookin' at? who's that? you know him? he's following awful close.
JOHN: grab onto something.
FALFA: sorry if i scared ya, man.
JOHN: takes more than that to scare me.
FALFA: where ya been hiding? didn't anyone tell ya i been looking for ya?
JOHN: hey, i can't keep tracka all the punks lookin' for me.
FALFA: they say you're the fastest thing in the valley. but that can't be your car, man. that must be your mama's car. hell, i feel embarrassed just getting near ya.
JOHN: ya should, man--you're driving a field car.
FALFA: field car? what's a field car?
JOHN: field cars drive through the fields, dropping cow all over the place to make the lettuce grow.
FALFA: that's pretty good. hey, i like that paint job you got. what they call that--sorta a cross between yellow and puke green, ain't it?
JOHN: yeah, well, you're car's so ugly you must have to sneak up on the pumps to get a tank of gas.
FALFA: well, at least i don't have to move over to let a funeral go by, man.
CAROL: your car's uglier than i am.
CAROL: that didn't come out right...
FALFA: come on, boy, prove it. let's go.
JOHN: look kid, why don't you go out and win a few races, then come back and see me.
CAROL: oh, race him, you can beat him.
FALFA: hey, that's a tough lookin' girl you got with you, man. what're you doin'? trying to pick up a few extra bucks babysitting? hey, doll. why don't you come on and ride with me--in about ten years?
JOHN: leave her out of this. this is just between you and me.
CAROL: wow! he's really fast, isn't he?
JOHN: yeah. but he's stupid.

CURT: hey--any of you guys know a blonde in a white t-bird? 
JOE: yeah, i seen her, what about it?
CURT: i was just wondering who she is.
JOE: she's outta your price range, man. my brother's been with her and he clued me in.
CURT: price range? you mean she's a--
JOE: yeah, thirty dollar sheri. can you believe that? thirty dollars.
CURT: we must be thinking of different blondes.
CARLOS: hey man, don't tell joe what he thinks.
ANTS: thirty dollars ain't much. i saw ten thousand once. my old man had it in a suitcase. they caught him the next morning though.
CARLOS: fuzz ahead, watch it.
JOE: where?
CARLOS: fuzz ahead, watch it.
JOE: where?
CARLOS: at jerrie's cherries. you can just barely see the fender.
ANTS: that's rotten, man. hiding like that.
CARLOS: that's shitty.
JOE: it's dishonest.
JOE: we oughta do something. i got an idea. i got a good idea.

STEVE: i think i'm gonna go over to burger city. 
TERRY: yeah. yeah. laurie's probably over there.
STEVE: you really think she's got me worried about where she is, don't you?
TERRY: well...
STEVE: let me tell you something. i couldn't care less. want to come along?
DEBBIE: yeah, i do. i do.
TERRY: no.
STEVE: make up your minds.
TERRY: no, thanks. u'mm. you know we got to report the car missing.
STEVE: all right. see yuh.

TERRY: burger city? burger city!!? how can you think of hamburgers when somebody stole my car.

JOE: listen, ah--carl, i-- 
CURT: curt.
JOE: curt.
JOE: despite you scratching gil's car, i like you. and i know what you'd like more than anything right now. like every guy in town, you got the same secret dream, right?
JOE: ya want to join the pharoahs. huh? you can admit it--you'd like to--but you never dreamed it could be possible, did you?
JOE: well, tonight, i'm goin' to give you your chance.
JOE: get down!
JOE: okay. now you got it? i'm stayin' here. you're on your own.
CURT: wait a minute, wait a minute, joe. what if he hears me?
JOE: shhh. listen. look at it this way: now you got three choices. one, you chicken out. in that case, i let ants tie you to the car and drag you around a little bit. and you don't want that, right?
CURT: no.
JOE: two, you foul up and holstein hears you and well, ah... you don't want that, right?
CURT: no, i don't.
JOE: three, you are successful and you join the pharoahs with a carcoat, and the blood initiation and all that, huh?
CURT: wait--wait a minute. wait a minute! what blood initiation?
WOLFMAN: oh, here we go baby! here's "come go with me."

DEBBIE: hey, why don't we go get your jeep? 
TERRY: what? what are you talking about?
DEBBIE: you know, your jeep. the one you sold the hunting ponies for. the one with the four-wheel drive.
DEBBIE: come on, terry--terry?

JOE: hey, you sure you got enough slack? 
CURT: yeah, yeah. no sweat. let's get out of here.

CURT: stand by for justice! 
WOLFMAN: oh, i can't believe it. feels so good 'cause you're sweet sixteen.

CAROL: why are we stopping here? 
JOHN: carol...
CAROL: what?
JOHN: i--i don't think that i can control myself any longer.
CAROL: you can't?
JOHN: no... carol, i've got to have you.
