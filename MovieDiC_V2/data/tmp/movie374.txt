speaker1: hallo. i am andy. welcoom to my movie. i hoped the story of my life would be nice...but it turned out terrible! it is all lies! tings are mixed up... real people i knew play different people. what a mess! so i broke into universal and cut out the junk. now it's much shorter. in fact, this is the end of the movie. so tanks for comink! bye-bye! 
speaker1: okay! just my friends are left. i wanted to get rid of those other people... they would have laughed in the wrong places. i was only kidding about the movie... it's actually pretty good! it shows everything... from me as a little boy until my death -- oops!! i wasn't supposed to talk about that! oh. eh, uh, we better just begin. it starts back in great neck, long island...
speaker1: oh, yes. i remember it well...

speaker1: that's my boy! good swingin', kiddo. hey -- michael... where's your brother? 
speaker2: he's inside.

speaker1: is he in his room? 
speaker2: of course he's in his room. all his "friends" are in there.

speaker1: but professor, why are the monsters growing so big? 
speaker2: it's something in the jungle water. i need to crack the secret code.

speaker1: as british 
speaker2: maybe i should talk to the natives. shoom boom boo ba! shoom boom boo ba --
speaker3: andy!
speaker1: oh!
speaker3: andy, this has to stop. our house isn't a television station. there is not a camera in that wall. andy glances over at the wall. hmm. stanley son... listen to me. it isn't healthy. you should be outside, playing sports.
speaker1: but i've got a sports show.
speaker3: you know that's not what i meant! look, i'm gonna put my foot down! no more playing alone. you wanna perform, you gotta have an audience!
speaker1: b-but i have them.
speaker3: no! that is not an audience! that is plaster! an audience is people made of flesh! they -- live and breathe! got it?!

speaker1: as kiddie show 
speaker2: and now, boys and girls! it's time for... tv fun house!
speaker3: hi, everybody! are you ready for a singalong? i'll say the animal, and you make his sound! okay...? okay! "oh, the cow goes........." carol stares, unblinking. then --
speaker4: moo.
speaker1: "and the dog goes......"

speaker1: "and that's the way it goes!" thank you. goodbye! 
speaker2: the comedy stylings of andy kaufman, ladies and gentlemen!

speaker1: so, mr. besserman, same slot tomorrow...? 
speaker2: eh, i dunno... andy. i'm...
speaker1: you're firing me?? you don't even pay me!
speaker2: look -- i don't wanna seem insulting. but... your act is like amateur hour: singalongs... puppets... playing records...
speaker1: what do you want? "take my wife, please"??
speaker2: sure! comedy! make jokes about the traffic. do impressions. maybe a little blue material...
speaker1: i don't swear. i -- i don't do what everyone else does!
speaker2: well, everyone else gets this place cookin'! pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "pop goes the weasel." andy stares, disheartened. manager i'm sorry. you're finished here.

speaker1: give us your wallet. 
speaker2: i -- doo not unterstand!!
speaker1: give us your money!
speaker2: what?? what mooney? abu daboo! i do not have mooney! the thugs glance at each other. andy pleaze! i just move to america yezterday! i do not know!
speaker1: what's in the case?
speaker2: no! eeet, eet is just perzonal trifles from my homeland --
speaker3: shut up! gimme that thing!
speaker1: immigrants!
speaker3: this guy's pathetic. let's go.
speaker2: tank you veddy much...!

speaker1: so i'm getting my mother-in-law a special christmas present: a pre- paid funeral! the mortician asked me if i wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated. i said, "make it all three! i'm not takin' any chances!" thank you. good night! 
speaker2: now? now...?
speaker2: thank you very much.
speaker2: "warden threw a party in the county jail! prison band was there and they began to wail!"

speaker1: pst. what's the story with this guy? 
speaker2: i think he's lithuanian. none of us can understand him.
speaker1: he does a of an elvis.

speaker1: hey, i really enjoyed your set. 
speaker2: tank you veddy much.
speaker1: so i understand you're from lithuania?
speaker2: no. caspiar.
speaker1: caspiar? i haven't heard of that.
speaker2: it's a veddy small island in de caspian sea. it sunk.
speaker1: oh. hm. i'm uh, sorry. well, look, i'm probably out of my mind -- but i think you're very interesting. if you ever need representation... we should talk.
speaker2: mr. shapiro, it's an honor!!
speaker1: caspiar, huh?!

speaker1: you see, i want to be the biggest star in the world. 
speaker2: people love... comedians.
speaker1: i'm not a comedian. i have no talent. i'm a song-and-dance man.
speaker2: you show a lot of promise... but... my concern is i don't know where to book you. you're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
speaker1: i've always wanted to play carnegie hall.
speaker2: yeah, ha-ha. that's funny.
speaker1: see, i don't want easy laughs.

speaker1: you're insane. but -- you might also be brilliant. alright, andy... let's do it. george warmly extends his hand. andy slowly smiles, then takes george's hand. the men shake. a moment of supreme importance. 
speaker2: the glitz strip of los angeles. money. beauty.

speaker1: sammy, opening for david brenner is a fine gig. you'll be on the road... get some exposure... 
speaker2: tony clifton on the phone!
speaker1: who?
speaker2: he says he's an associate of andy kaufman's.
speaker1: oh. sammy, think about it. i gotta go. hello? george shapiro here.
speaker3: uh, yeah. is this george shapiro?
speaker1: er, yes. speaking.
speaker3: "speaking"! reeking, seeking, creaking... freaking!
speaker1: can i help you with something?
speaker3: yeah! you stay away from that andy kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
speaker1: who is this?
speaker3: you -- you know straight who it is. tony clifton! a name to respect. a name to fear. beer. gear. deer. ear.
speaker1: look... i don't know what your problem is...
speaker3: kaufman's a lying bastard! if you sign him, i'll ruin you!

speaker1: now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes. you should feel rested, relaxed, and alert. 
speaker2: do any thoughts come...?
speaker3: my mind is clear. i feel great.
speaker2: good...
speaker4: all the tension is gone from my body.
speaker5: i want to thank you, your holiness. my heart is radiating with pure energy.
speaker2: you always had a good heart. but i'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline.
speaker5: yes. tm got me focused. in fact, my manager got me a tv gig! it's just some new show with no budget, but i'm still excited.
speaker2: are you at peace with your family?
speaker5: um, yes. i haven't fought with them, since i started here.
speaker2: goals are important.
speaker5: i stopped drinking. i gave up drugs. and i'm meditating three hours a day. it's the center of my life...
speaker2: we are all impressed.
speaker1: okay. anyone else --?
speaker5: oh, wait! i have a question. is there... is there a secret to being funny?
speaker2: yes. silence.

speaker1: i still can't believe my brother's gonna be on tv...! 
speaker2: i hope he doesn't get nervous.
speaker3: what's the difference? this thing's on in the middle of the night -- no one's even gonna see it.
speaker4: welcome back to saturday night live! and now, as a special treat on our first show... musical guest andy

speaker1: "although we are in danger, we never despair, because we know where there is danger he is there!" 
speaker2: oh my he's doing nothing. it's dead air...!

speaker1: "we're not worrying at all. we're just listening for his call..." 
speaker2: mighty mouse theme "here i come to save the day!" shocked, the crowd howls with laughter.

speaker1: andy, c'mon in! thanks for flyin' out here!! 
speaker2: the stewardess let me keep my headphones.
speaker1: that's... terrific! but i got something better. this is big... you are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a
speaker2: sitcom...?
speaker1: and this is a class act! it's the guys who did the mary tyler moore and bob newhart shows! it takes place in a taxi stand! and you're gonna be the fonzie!
speaker2: i'm -- fonzie?
speaker1: no! the fonzie! the crazy breakout character! the guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
speaker2: george, i hate sitcoms.
speaker1: hang on, you ain't heard the best part! abc has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- "latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
speaker2: no.
speaker1: "no"? "no" to which part??
speaker2: no to the whole thing. none of it sounds good.
speaker1: andy... this is every comedian's dream.
speaker2: i told you, i'm not a comedian. and sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: stupid jokes and canned laughter.
speaker1: b-but, this is classy... they did bob newha--
speaker2: i'm not interested. i want to create my own material.
speaker1: you have to do it.
speaker2: i refuse.
speaker2: okay. fine, i'll do it. but i have a few terms.
speaker1: of course! that's what negotiations are for. andy starts to write on a piece of paper. george what are you doing?
speaker2: writing down my terms. george watches patiently.
speaker1: are you makin' fun of me --? this is ridiculous!
speaker2: those are my terms.
speaker1: they're impossible!! i mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for tony clifton"??! who is this tony clifton?!
speaker2: he's a vegas entertainer. i used to do impressions of him. we sorta... got in a fight over that.
speaker1: this clifton called me up. he's a loon! he hates you!
speaker2: nah, he just talks tough. but i owe him one. andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern. andy if i'm the new fonz... abc's just gonna have to give me what i want.
speaker3: heyyyyyy!

speaker1: tony clifton. 
speaker2: who is he?!
speaker1: i don't know.
speaker3: couldn't kaufman ask for more money, like everyone else? george slowly, sadly shakes his head: no. maynard glances at his team -- then frowns. maynard george, we don't book phantom performers. the deal's off.

speaker1: andy? 
speaker2: hi george!
speaker1: eh, hi, andy. look, this tony clifton... is he performing anywhere?
speaker2: of course. but only on monday nights.
speaker1: that's alright. where...?

speaker1: and now, mama roma's is proud to present international singing sensation... a man who has sold more records than elvis and the beatles combined... george is skeptical. announcer ladies and gentlemen, mr. entertainment... tony clifton! 
speaker2: goddamn, i paid five dollars for this.
speaker1: and now! a man who needs no introduction... tony clifton!
speaker3: heh-heh. how ya all doin'?
speaker2: you!
speaker3: "volare! whoa, whoa. cantare, whoa whoa whoa whoa." george winces. he's horrible. tony clifton "i got the wings of your love, i got the wings of a dove. i got the... uh... ... the chicken wings from eh, kentucky fried..." the band is lost. tony clifton oh. whoop do doo, whoop de di, stick a needle in your eye... the band gives up and stops. tony clifton eh, the with that song. one person claps. most boo. tony clifton so how ya doin'! how ya doin' over here? how ya doin' over there?
speaker4: how's that pasta carbonara?
speaker5: leave me alone.
speaker3: okay! so, you havin' a good time, sir?!
speaker6: sure...
speaker3: what's your name?
speaker6: bob.
speaker3: "bob"? bob! bob bob bob. bob what?
speaker6: bob gorsky.
speaker3: "gorsky"? what is that, polish?
speaker6: yes.
speaker3: are you tryin' to do some of that polack humor? well if that's so, you can just get the out of this restaurant!
speaker6: it's my name.
speaker3: shut up! i hate them polish jokes! people are embarrassed. tony clifton i do a clean show! like, i wouldn't do that one... oh, you know it... "what do you call a pretty girl in poland"?
speaker6: a -- a tourist.
speaker3: see, that's exactly what i'm talkin' about! here! i'll give you a little humor!
speaker7: and you. i wanna see you backstage!

speaker1: alright, i'm here. what do you want? 
speaker2: are you hungry?
speaker1: i... i-i don't understand this act.
speaker2: it's good old-fashioned entertainment. everyone loves a villain.
speaker1: yeah? well tell that to the poor schlub who you humiliated!
speaker3: hey andy, good show.
speaker2: oh george, this is bob zmuda. bob and i have been buddies for years.
speaker3: that was a really hot house!
speaker1: so your name's not gorsky.
speaker3: don't believe everything you hear.

speaker1: andy! 
speaker2: what's up?
speaker1: andy... they said yes! they agreed to it all! they thought your terms were a shining example of your "irreverent wit" -- and precisely why they want you! you're getting everything! whoa. andy looks up, astonished. his space station
speaker2: well thank you very much...!

speaker1: man, this is where's kaufman? why isn't he here?? 
speaker2: you'll see him on friday when we shoot. now run the lines with rodney.

speaker1: i'm taking bets we do the show with the stand-in. 
speaker2: no, i hear andy arrived. rumor is he's locked inside his dressing room.

speaker1: i'm gonna quit. 
speaker2: what?!?
speaker1: each show is worse than the next.
speaker2: are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week!
speaker1: so? what do they know?
speaker2: absolutely nothing! that's the beauty! it's credibility. you make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!

speaker1: i don't care! travolta signed a contract, he's a sweathog for life!... oh yeah? just try to sue us. he hangs up. his assistant peeks her head in. 
speaker2: sir, they're having a problem down on the kaufman special. they say he's not following the... technical requirements.
speaker1: "technical"???

speaker1: andy, i hear fabulous things about the special... eh, i understand we've hit a teeny speedbump? 
speaker2: yeah, kid genius told me to mess with the horizontal hold! he wants the picture to roll!
speaker1: show me.
speaker3: and now... in her television debut, the incredible chubby rosalie!!
speaker3: it'll be great. the viewer will think their tv is broken. they'll get out of their chair, they'll twist the knobs, they'll hit the tv, but they won't be able to fix it! maynard stares at the monitor. the totally indecipherable picture still rolls. a glum pause.
speaker1: andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair. they might change the channel.
speaker3: but it's funny! it's a practical joke. they'll get frustrated!
speaker1: andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: the viewer must be able to see the program.
speaker3: but it's only for thirty seconds!
speaker1: five.
speaker3: twenty!
speaker1: ten.
speaker3: deal.
speaker4: mr. kaufman, do you want your mail?

speaker1: ... so after i finish junior college, i'll go to work for my dad's accounting firm. unless, i decide to live with my friend valerie, but she wants to move to anaheim, and i don't want to do that. 
speaker2: oh. another beat. andy so do you wanna wrestle?
speaker1: excuse me -- ?
speaker2: do you wanna wrestle? it's a good way of breaking the ice. that instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
speaker1: what are you talking about?! we just met an hour ago.
speaker2: no no no, it's not sex! i mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
speaker1: i don't wanna talk about it!
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: i mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant. i love this time of day.
speaker2: i've never understood that. it's just... getting dark. but i like you! hey! why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to tijuana, and get married???
speaker3: fear. she shivers, then hoarsely speaks.
speaker1: i think i wanna go home.

speaker1: you know... i was once in your gallery. i was just sitting there and i wanted to touch you. i was kind of depressed because i could see what everyone was like, and i was wondering if, now, maybe i could... touch you. 
speaker1: howdy, i've been watching you ever since i was a little boy... you're the first friend from television i ever had. i always wanted to meet you... and now ...i finally am.
speaker2: this is not funny.
speaker3: "artsy fartsy shit"...
speaker4: no... eh, the special isn't all like this... just wait... it will be hysterical.
speaker5: christ! we're the number one network -- can't we afford decent tvs?!
speaker4: no, um... it's part of the snow. an awful beat.
speaker5: tell kaufman we will never air this program!!

speaker1: excuse me, could i please have more coffee? 
speaker2: yeah, yeah, in a sec'. that was decaf, right?
speaker1: you know, you look just like andy kaufman.
speaker2: yeah, i get that all the time.
speaker3: i'm telling you, it's him.
speaker1: you wanna bet?? if that was him, he wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my coffee!

speaker1: hey! could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake? andy turns. they stare down each other. george andy, this is ridiculous. take off that apron. 
speaker2: no! i'd rather work here, than at abc. there's no lying in a restaurant. they don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook!
speaker1: look, i'm sorry. they're assholes! but we work in a creative business. you can't predict what people are gonna like --
speaker2: the only reason i did taxi was so i could have my own special!
speaker1: tell you what. i'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
speaker2: yeah, we can have a garage sale. "hey look, i got a floor lamp and a network tv special for only fifty cents!" a glum moment. andy fills water glasses. andy how long is left on my taxi contract?
speaker1: you signed for five years -- so four years, seven months.
speaker2: okay... i'll go back. but just let them know, first they ain't gettin' latka. they're gettin' tony!

speaker1: excuse me one moment. 
speaker1: give me the book.
speaker2: no! andy, don't do it --
speaker1: they're asking for it.
speaker1: since you're such a special audience... i'm going to reveal, for the first time ever, the real me.

speaker1: tank you veddy much!!!! 
speaker1: "when i came back from the east last autumn, i felt that i wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; i wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart..." people start booing. andy looks up. andy please, let's keep it down. we have a long way to go. "only gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction - gatsby, who represented everything for which i have an unaffected scorn..." the crowd is incredulous.

speaker1: is he ever going to stop? 
speaker2: sure. when he reaches "the end."

speaker1: "tom was evidently perturbed at daisy's running around alone, for on the following saturday night he came with her to gatsby's party. perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness..." a weak voice feebly shouts: 
speaker2: do latka.
speaker1: look! i don't have to tolerate this impoliteness! forget it -- i'm gonna stop the show. goodbye!
speaker1: "his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness - it stands out in my memory from gatsby's other parties that summer..."

speaker1: nobody likes anarchy more than me... but this is science fiction! 
speaker2: let's get some breakfast.

speaker1: what kind of show was this??! there were three-hundred walkouts! the promoter wants a refund! 
speaker2: i'm sorry, george...
speaker1: you're right you're sorry! and you -- you're the road manager!
speaker3: we might have lost our focus...
speaker1: when you play the midwest and south, you don't mindfuck these people! it's not postmodern -- it's rude. if you wanna perform in texas, you give 'em mighty mouse! you give 'em elvis!!
speaker2: but george, i like to push the boundaries...
speaker1: and that's great. but do it in la and new york! there you experiment! show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! i don't care!
speaker2: how long would they let me sleep?
speaker1: i don't know! andy... you need to look inside: who are you trying to entertain? the audience... or yourself?
speaker4: he doesn't know the answer.

speaker1: i'm worried about andy. his stress level is affecting his work. 
speaker2: isn't tony clifton going on taxi soon? maybe that'll chill him out.
speaker1: bob, andy needs to relax. see if you can get him away from all this. take him to hawaii, or bali... find something special. something nice...

speaker1: i dunno about this... what will my mother think? 
speaker2: she'll say, "now my son is a man."
speaker1: it's so dirty.
speaker2: nah. the girls sponge off between johns.
speaker1: okay.

speaker1: which one? 
speaker2: i vill haf both! i vill haf dat fraulein... unt... the vun vith the big strudels!
speaker1: this is a big day. it's my friend's first time with a prostitute.
speaker3: what're you talking about? andy comes here almost every weekend.
speaker1: you're talking about... andy?
speaker3: oh, he doesn't always call himself that. sometimes he's tony, and wears a tux.

speaker1: you let me win. 
speaker2: what if we did...?!
speaker1: hey. if i give you three-hundred dollars, will you come to la and help me destroy a tv show?

speaker1: where is he? 
speaker2: he just arrived.
speaker3: he's an hour late.
speaker2: look, i'm told this clifton guy is a little eccentric. you're all just gonna have to roll with the punches this week.
speaker4: taxi! laxy! just the factsy,
speaker5: i added me a musical number, cut out judd hirsch, and changed the location to mardi gras!

speaker1: and now, the new theme song! "oh yes, we drive a taxi, and we're havin' fun. yeah, we work together, and we get the freakin' job done." 
speaker2: george, we've lost two days. filming is on friday. we have to let him go!
speaker3: i'm not sure how andy's gonna take this...
speaker2: so we'll go downstairs and tell him!
speaker3: but that's tony down there. that's not andy. trust me, it's like "sybil" -- andy's nowhere on the premises!
speaker2: well whoever the that is, i'm firing him!
speaker3: okay. but we'll have to warn andy first. i think he's up in san francisco, doing a concert.

speaker1: hi, diane, this is george. i'm trying to reach andy up in san francisco. yeah, i'll wait. 
speaker2: hi, george! good to hear from you!
speaker1: hi, andy. how's the weather up there?
speaker2: oh, you know the bay area! always foggy!
speaker1: i'm here with ed over at taxi.
speaker2: oh no! did he get hurt?
speaker3: no, no, andy, nothing like that. but... tony's not fitting in. his style of performance is too...

speaker1: andy, i'm calling you up like this because i have the utmost respect for your artistry. but -- i need your permission to fire him. 
speaker2: oh dear! george, this is gonna kill tony. he's waited his whole life for this break.
speaker3: there'll be other shots.
speaker1: andy, i have to do it. he's a terrible actor.
speaker2: i guess i understand. but ed -- please... let him down gentle.
speaker1: yes, andy, i will. andy hangs up. a relieved ed turns to george. ed thank you.

speaker1: we had a deal!! 
speaker2: i don't know what yer talkin' about.
speaker1: yeah!! i talked to andy kaufman!
speaker2: i don't know nothin' about no kaufman. he's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. been usin' my good name, to get places.
speaker1: get off my stage! you're fired!
speaker2: i got a contract!! i'm gonna take you to the department of labor!
speaker1: who're you?!
speaker3: i'm from the la times. we're doing a little puff piece on mr. clifton. mr. kaufman arranged it.
speaker1: security! this man off the lot!!
speaker2: stop! getcher hands off me! tony scuffles. the camera flashes.

speaker1: i don't want those pictures getting out. 
speaker2: i'll take care of this.
speaker1: wait -- he's one of them!

speaker1: hey. good hustlin'. 
speaker2: that asshole! that
speaker3: um, ed... you have a phone call --

speaker1: well, um... it's andy kaufman... 
speaker2: yeah???
speaker3: you were brilliant.
speaker2: huh?
speaker3: you were in the moment. you became a producer losing his mind. it was the best improv i've ever seen.

speaker1: well -- thank you. 
speaker2: okay. see you next week. andy hangs up. ed just sits there, astounded.

speaker1: this is great! it makes tony real - - three-dimensional! it's very good for his career. 
speaker2: "was this in actuality andy kaufman? and if it was andy kaufman, is andy kaufman crazy?"
speaker1: boy, they totally fell for it! i'm only acting crazy! hmm. a few awkward glances. then -- andy grins at his meal. andy boy, this is tasty.
speaker3: hey, can i please have some more seaweed?!

speaker1: ehh -- andy doesn't really like playing casinos. the audiences don't work well for him. 
speaker2: oh. disappointed beat. the booker thinks. booker what about tony clifton?
speaker1: really?! you want tony clifton to headline harrah's tahoe??
speaker2: eh, sure. we're trying to expand our audience base -- and i know the college kids really love andy kaufman.
speaker1: look -- i gotta be clear with you.
speaker2: yeah, yeah, yeah. i know! wink wink! nudge nudge!
speaker1: no, i'm serious. if you book tony, do not expect to get andy.
speaker2: i'll take my chances!!
speaker1: fine, be my guest! book him.

speaker1: george is flabbergasted. 
speaker2: gene, you misunderstood!! you're not getting both of them! it's physically impossible!
speaker3: why's that? you said over and over and over, tony clifton is not andy kaufman --
speaker2: yeah, i know what i said! but -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
speaker3: sure it is. tony called me himself. he yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than andy's. they're both going on tonight, believe me!

speaker1: you're not listenin'! it's a very simple concept. 
speaker2: you're making no sense. how can they be the same person --?
speaker1: trust me! you'll never see them on stage at the same time!

speaker1: he's never gonna start! kaufman thinks this is funny! we've paid forty bucks for a show that's never gonna start! 
speaker2: you see! i told you! they're not the same person!
speaker3: thank you! thank you! i wrote this tune for my friend frank sinatra. he had a nice little success with it... but forgot to thank me on the album. he starts to belt "i gotta be me".

speaker1: you're so proud. you're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "look, dad, i got an f!" 
speaker2: but wasn't it funny?
speaker1: "funny"? i dunno. but "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure. like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
speaker2: uh-huh! see, with all these articles, people think they're insiders. they see tony clifton, and they say, "ah, that's really andy kaufman." but that spoils it. so now, tony denying being me is the truth! tony's not me! but maybe he is! the audience will never know... they'll think they're laughin' at me -- but actually i'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and i'm right!
speaker1: so you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. you... and you.
speaker3: sure! but we think it's kickass! now i get to be tony. i get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
speaker1: but what's the point? how will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
speaker2: george... i'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. but short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, i don't know what else to do. 'cause i've always got to be one step ahead of them.
speaker1: but i feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. it's obsessive. nothing's ever on the level anymore.
speaker2: george, it never was. didn't you know that?

speaker1: look at this! an evil russian! ooo, here's an evil -- he likes to fight dirty! hey, here's an evil japanese guy! 
speaker2: what is this, world war two...?
speaker1: you know, i always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
speaker2: no offense, pal, but i just don't think you're built for it. these he- men'll kick your ass!! they're huge! andy's face drops. he realizes zmuda's right.
speaker1: maybe i'll pick on someone smaller than me...!

speaker1: ... and i vow to continue wrestling until i am bea ten, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!! 
speaker2: by a woman.
speaker1: yes! by a woman!
speaker2: any... volunteers...?
speaker3: all the women's hands angrily shoot up!
speaker4: i wanna kill that jerk.

speaker1: will you please shake hands, go to your corners, and come out wrestling. 
speaker2: i'm the winner! i've got the

speaker1: here's your complimentary photo with merv. here's your turtle wax -- 
speaker2: i don't need turtle wax.
speaker1: every guest of merv gets it. and here's your dinner-for-two voucher at red lobster.
speaker3: gosh, you scored! look at all those goodies!
speaker2: buzz off. go patronize somebody else.
speaker3: hey, i hope you didn't take that stuff i said seriously. it was just part of the show! it's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
speaker2: oh. so you were just pretending to be an
speaker3: it's what i'm good at!

speaker1: merv griffin has received 2000 pieces of hate mail. andy, merv griffin doesn't get hate mail. 
speaker2: that means it was a success. i woke up the audience -- like punk rock!
speaker3: here, take this.
speaker1: no, i'm not gonna take it. if i take it i'll break my back.
speaker2: they're having a laugh...
speaker1: wrong! you haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
speaker2: that's because they've only seen it once. but i'll do it again, and again, and again... they'll catch on!

speaker1: hi... 
speaker2: hi... am i late?
speaker1: no, i'm sure we'll be fine.
speaker1: popcorn?
speaker2: no thanks.
speaker1: i really want one.
speaker2: andy, the theater's that way!
speaker1: hey, i love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean i have to sit through "on golden pond." lynne stands in place. andy smiles. andy c'mon. we'll go for a walk.
speaker2: fine.

speaker1: why did you call me? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you. 
speaker2: gosh. gee, lynne... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.

speaker1: hi... 
speaker2: hi... am i late?
speaker1: no, i'm sure we'll be fine.
speaker1: popcorn?
speaker2: no thanks.
speaker1: i really want one.
speaker2: andy, the theater's that way!
speaker1: hey, i love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean i have to sit through "on golden pond." lynne stands in place. andy smiles. andy c'mon. we'll go for a walk.
speaker2: fine.

speaker1: why did you call me? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you. 
speaker2: gosh. gee, lynne... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
speaker1: you were impressed with something. it's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
speaker2: oh! uh, i hope i didn't offend you.
speaker1: i'm here, ain't i?
speaker2: do you wanna to go to memphis and get married?
speaker1: do i wanna go to memphis and get married?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: why memphis?
speaker2: he speaks very
speaker3: because memphis is the wrestling capital of the world! i'll go in the ring, and i'll announce that i will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me! then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and i'll let you win! then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on letterman, like tiny tim did on carson... right there on the show! what do you say???
speaker1: and all this will be for real?
speaker2: if you want...

speaker1: look here, andy kaufman! i'll take you on -- sissy! 
speaker2: ooo, the little lady's upset. well i say -- get back in the kitchen!
speaker3: stop it! this woman's a fake! she's nothing but kaufman's girlfriend!
speaker2: t-that's not true --
speaker3: it's a set-up! and i won't allow our great sport to be degraded by a fix!!
speaker1: andy... who is that...?
speaker4: i'm jerry lawler, the king of memphis wrestling!!
speaker5: so if kaufman wants to tangle, i've brought a real wrestler! she's trained and she's ready!! kaufman, do you think you can handle... foxy

speaker1: are you scared??? 
speaker2: alright, you won. get off her!
speaker3: jerry, help her! get in there! do something!
speaker4: w-what are you doing? i don't fight men!
speaker2: yeah?! well i got news for you, andy kaufman! wrestling is a serious sport to me! i don't like anyone makin' fun of it, and i hate anyone insultin' the south! so we can settle this two ways: we can go to court... or you can get in the ring with a man, and wrestle for
speaker4: he -- can't get away with this. you! you think i'm chicken?!
speaker5: you wanna "wraaastle" me?! you wanna "wraaastle" me??? okay, lawler -- let's rumble! yeah, i've only wrestled women, but they were bigger than you! in fact, they're probably smarter than you, 'cause you're from "maaamphis, taaanassee!" i'm from hollywood. i have the brains. that's how i win. and mr. lawler, i'm gonna make you cry "mama!"

speaker1: is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble?? 
speaker2: i can shtop whenever i want...
speaker1: then stop treating me like a prop.
speaker2: i-i'm sorry. i got caught up in the action...!
speaker1: i'm warning you, kaufman: one morning you're gonna wake up... and your head's gonna be shaved.

speaker1: andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore? where's that sweet guy who used to do "here i come to save the day!"? please, enough with the wrestling! 
speaker2: what, you don't think i can beat him?
speaker1: he is the southern heavyweight champion. he'll kill you. first, you piss-off women. then you piss-off the south. then you get killed! and i did the bookings.
speaker2: you said -- live?

speaker1: i'm not comfortable with the last sketch. i don't do drug humor! 
speaker2: andy, it'll be fine! it's what we're known for! "maui? "wowie!"
speaker1: you're not listening to me --
speaker2: don't worry! the kids will love it

speaker1: but i don't do drugs! and i don't enjoy making light of them! 
speaker1: i was promised creative control!
speaker2: what a prick!

speaker1: i saw michael! 
speaker2: where?
speaker1: there!

speaker1: afterwards, i'll take you backstage. you can meet my brother. the girl smiles excitedly. 
speaker2: "gee, restaurants are amazing, aren't they? all these strangers sitting around... stuffing dead animals in their faces! it's just incredible!"
speaker3: "if you say so."
speaker4: "excuse me, i'll be right back." andy stands and walks out.

speaker1: hmph! they sure didn't give andy much to do. 
speaker2: he said he's coming back!

speaker1: "gee, that bathroom is so colorf--" suddenly he stops. the actors glance up. 
speaker2: you okay, honey? something wrong, carl?
speaker1: i can't, um... andy shakes his head. the crowd laughs nervously. andy i can't play stoned.

speaker1: shit...! what's he doing?? 
speaker2: it's okay. stay with it.
speaker3: just read the cue cards!
speaker4: i can't play stoned. i feel really stupid.
speaker5: you feel stupid? what about us?! the tension is awful.
speaker4: you didn't have to do that!
speaker3: hey! cut it out!
speaker5: you jerk!
speaker6: go to commercial, man! get off the stage!
speaker4: i said i didn't want to do the sketch.

speaker1: oh my --! 
speaker2: why didn't someone tell us???
speaker3: excuse me!... i have an announcement to make! you've all just participated in a "happening." to make it real, some of you knew, and some of you didn't.
speaker4: right...
speaker3: okay, great! so let's reset!
speaker5: andy...!

speaker1: why is andy doing this? why?... why? 
speaker2: during the commercial, the people at abc asked me to apologize... and to tell you the truth. they wanted me to explain that this whole fighting episode was staged...

speaker1: and... um... i can't do this. i-i can't say it. it's a lie! a cover-up! 
speaker2: cue the commercial!
speaker1: these kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials. now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to memphis... and blink! andy gets cut off.
speaker2: i'm gonna strangle george shapiro!

speaker1: what's in memphis? 
speaker2: who knows?! that kid is totally meshuga.

speaker1: why is he saying these things?! 
speaker2: they're gonna lynch him!
speaker3: nah. he's just engaging a passive audience.
speaker4: people, this is a bar of soap. does it look familiar to you? if you wet it, it'll clean your hands. stanley's eyes bulge.
speaker5: kaufman, we've had enough!! let's you and me do what we came here for

speaker1: and kaufman's left the ring! 
speaker2: is this a strategy?
speaker1: and kaufman's left the ring again! he doesn't seem interested in actually making contact with his opponent.
speaker3: andy, please. let's go home!
speaker4: don't worry, mom. i'll make you proud...!
speaker5: hey! did you come down here to wrestle, or to act like an ass?
speaker1: it's a side suplex!!

speaker1: why isn't he moving?? 
speaker2: lawler has committed a piledriver, which is an automatic disqualification! match goes to kaufman by disqualification, after two minutes, twelve seconds! andy is splayed unconscious.

speaker1: andy!! are you okay?!? 
speaker2: i'm fine, mom, you can calm down.
speaker3: b-but... we saw... your neck...
speaker2: nah, it's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing. it didn't hurt at all. it was just a yoga move. i tucked my head in. deadpan, andy sits up.
speaker3: andrew -- how dare you!! for all we knew, you were dying! look at your mother -- she's still shaking! andy is splayed unconscious.

speaker1: andy!! are you okay?!? 
speaker2: i'm fine, mom, you can calm down.
speaker3: b-but... we saw... your neck...
speaker2: nah, it's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing. it didn't hurt at all. it was just a yoga move. i tucked my head in. deadpan, andy sits up.
speaker3: andrew -- how dare you!! for all we knew, you were dying! look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
speaker2: but that's it. i needed you to believe! our family will be in the newspapers. people will look, and they'll be touched. because your emotions were honest!
speaker1: andy, i love you! i love you, whatever you do...! she hugs andy tightly.
speaker2: geez, i'm sorry. maybe i shouldn't have put you through all that... well, from now on, you'll always know the rule of thumb: anything that happens to me... is not real.

speaker1: i don't see any injury to your neck, mr. kaufman. 
speaker2: are you sure?
speaker1: positive.
speaker2: but my neck hurts... and i have a slight cough...
speaker1: it's probably just a strained muscle.
speaker2: doctor, i think i need a neck brace.
speaker1: if it makes you happy...

speaker1: "... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis. his parents are at his bedside. fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television's taxi"... 
speaker2: it's a rave! boy, if i ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
speaker1: it's working for elvis.
speaker3: yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback. listen to this! "it was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
speaker1: wow, you can't buy this kind of publicity!
speaker2: george, let's not drop the ball on this. i've made some kind of cosmic career move.

speaker1: thanks for seeing me on such short notice. i... i wanted to talk to you about booking andy on "saturday night live." 
speaker2: george -- i don't know if andy works for our show anymore. that wrestling stuff... is such a turnoff.
speaker1: we agree completely. andy has to reconnect with his core audience. so i got him on letterman tonight. he's gonna apologize to jerry lawler, then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans.
speaker2: that's smart.
speaker1: he's very sincere. and he needs your show...
speaker2: okay. it'd be good to have the old andy back.

speaker1: i apologize for all the wrestling i've ever done. i'm sorry for all the abuse i've ever given... i was just playing bad guy wrestler. that's not me... it's just a role. but jerry took it personally. 
speaker2: you said some pretty inflammatory things.
speaker3: he thinks everything's a joke -- but it's not. did you laugh when you were layin' in the hospital?? the crowd whoooos.
speaker1: t-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
speaker3: you're a wimp.
speaker1: my father said i should've gotten a lawyer --!
speaker3: then your father's a wimp.

speaker1: you said some pretty inflammatory things. 
speaker2: he thinks everything's a joke -- but it's not. did you laugh when you were layin' in the hospital?? the crowd whoooos.
speaker3: t-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
speaker2: you're a wimp.
speaker3: my father said i should've gotten a lawyer --!
speaker2: then your father's a wimp.

speaker1: this is bad... i only got 28 percent! i'm like mcgovern in 
speaker2: george sighs.
speaker3: and this wasn't "merv." this was the hippest audience on television. they've turned on you.
speaker1: we were just trying to push the envelope --
speaker3: you're blind! there is no envelope anymore!! it hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution -- i don't want you two to ever work together again. we widen...
speaker4: i'm sorry. we thought it was funny...
speaker1: jer', it's not your fault. you were terrific. but maybe george is right...
speaker4: that's fine. but i wouldn't have traded it for anything... because for one brief, shining moment... the world thought that wrestling was real.
speaker1: we'll stay in touch. next time i'm in memphis, i'll stop by the house, and noreen can make me her double chocolate cake.
speaker4: alright, buddy... stay good. andy and jerry hug.
speaker1: maybe i can turn it into a bit. i can go back on the show, and say it was rigged. demand a recount...
speaker3: andy! you don't get it! they don't want you back.

speaker1: open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... 
speaker2: excuse me, andy...
speaker1: yes, your holiness?
speaker2: this is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
speaker1: why?? i... i attend every year.
speaker2: yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to tm. but we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
speaker1: "philosophically"?
speaker2: the wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual. it seems you have no respect for anything.
speaker1: of course i do...
speaker1: please! you've got to let me take the classes! it's how i keep myself

speaker1: it is apparently not working. 
speaker2: so help me! all i wanna do is

speaker1: go away. 
speaker2: it's me.
speaker1: oh, it's open.
speaker2: i brought you haagen dazs.
speaker1: i don't deserve haagen daz. i'm a horrible person.
speaker2: andy, you're not horrible. you're just... complicated.
speaker1: you don't know the real me.
speaker2: andy... there is no real you.
speaker3: an astonished silence.
speaker1: you're probably right. they both giggle.
speaker1: do you wanna move in together?

speaker1: hey! our first phone call! hello? 
speaker2: andy... it's me. i've got some crummy news. taxi's been canceled. silence. andy has no response. george do you want me to come over? talk about it?
speaker1: um... no. uh, i'm sorta busy right now. thanks. we'll get together next week.

speaker1: and now we have a treat for you late- night diehards. the star of taxi -- here in person, andy kaufman! 
speaker2: actually, budd, you're wrong. i found out today that taxi's been canceled. the crowd awwwws sadly. andy blinks. andy yeah, that's how i felt too... though i don't know why. 'cause for years, all i wanted to do was get off that show. but now that nobody will hire me, and nobody thinks i'm funny... i guess it was probably a pretty good job. one guy laughs sharply.

speaker1: i made six bucks. that's good money. 
speaker2: this is a comedy club -- not a medical sideshow. if you wanna perform here, take a shower, get some sleep, and pull yourself together. come back and do the material that people love: do the mighty mouse, the foreign guy! andy, you gotta snap out of this funk! if you can -- i'll give you the headline spot tomorrow.

speaker1: hey, what's going on here? 
speaker2: george, you won't believe it... i got andy to do all the old material! and he's killin' them!

speaker1: ... but one ting i do not like is too much traffic. tonight i had to come on de freeway, and it was so much traffic... it took me an hour and a half to get here! foreign man chuckles pathetically. the crowd howls. andy's rockin'. andy but talking about the terrible things: my wife. take my -- 
speaker2: "take my wife, please take her."
speaker1: t-take my wife, please take her... the rhythm is thrown. a couple laughs.
speaker2: "her cooking is so bad, is terrible."
speaker1: h-her cooking...
speaker3: "but right now i would like to do for you some imitations. first, the archie bunker." andy freezes up. the audience is embarrassed.
speaker1: sir, do you have a problem?
speaker3: yeah, my problem is you're tired.
speaker1: i, i was asked to do this material -

speaker1: sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap. kaufman, people are sick of you. the wrestling... the hoaxes... 
speaker2: hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
speaker1: who gives a shit?! it's not funny!
speaker3: why...? andy, why...?

speaker1: i used to think you were original. 
speaker2: i was very original!
speaker1: yeah, exactly -- "was"! but now, you're creatively bankrupt. in fact, ladies and gentlemen, kaufman's so desperate, he paid me to do this tonight!! i'm a plant. it's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. isn't that true??? andy shudders. the audience averts their eyes. a painful silence.

speaker1: the world thinks andy kaufman so i was just giving 'em what they want... 
speaker2: andy, they don't think you suck. they've just... lost a reason to love you. the guys stop walking. george gently speaks. george you've gotta make the public embrace you again. you have to win back their sympathy...
speaker1: i'll come up with something.

speaker1: look at that grand slam! two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes -- $2.99! how do they do it? 
speaker2: they get you on the coffee.
speaker3: excuse me -- but could andy tell us why we're here??? all heads turn. a long pause.
speaker4: i have cancer.
speaker1: hey, that's good! we can make that play. and we'll really drag it out. you get better, you get worse... you die...
speaker3: forget it. it's in terrible taste! i want nothing to do with this.
speaker2: andy, are you serious?
speaker1: serious like a heart attack! hey, maybe i can push you around in some goofy wheelchair!
speaker4: no, it's true. i have lung cancer.
speaker3: that's ridiculous. you don't even smoke.
speaker4: i -- i got some freaky rare kind. it's called large-celled carcinoma.
speaker2: andy! can they cure it?
speaker4: they don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
speaker2: have you told your family?
speaker4: no, no! not yet. i feel bad -- i've jerked 'em around so many times.
speaker3: andy... you look me in the eye, and tell me this is true.
speaker4: george -- it's true.
speaker3: if i find out you're behind this, i'll kill you.
speaker1: what are ya talkin' about?! i was the one saying i didn't believe it!
speaker3: exactly. that's the sort of thing you guys would work out to me up.

speaker1: how can you be so casual??! 
speaker2: even if i'm dying -- i still need clean socks.
speaker1: you're not dying!
speaker2: okay. you're probably right.
speaker1: you're so detached!! lynne storms out.
speaker3: thank you, girl. you're my best friend. timmy warmly embraces the dog.
speaker2: dad...?

speaker1: the cancer started in andy's left arm and spread to his lungs. we've initiated an aggressive radiation program... see if we can eradicate the affected cells. excuse me. i'll be right back. 
speaker2: what a crock.
speaker3: how dare you make light of this!
speaker2: dad, i cried when he broke his neck.
speaker3: he's got lung cancer!
speaker2: see, that's exactly it! he picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke. that makes it weird! if he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "poor andy, he's really sick." so he chose lung cancer, because he wants us to be scratching our heads, saying, "is this real?"
speaker4: of course it's real. we're in a hospital...
speaker5: mom, it's cedars-sinai! it's a showbiz hospital! andy's studio friends probably run this place!
speaker2: he plans these things out. he takes over, hires actors... personally, i didn't think that "doctor" was very convincing.
speaker5: did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes?
speaker5: we all know he's talked about faking his own death...
speaker3: sure -- but what if he isn't? my son could be dying... and we're actin' like we're on candid camera.

speaker1: i want you to visualize. visualize big, healthy white cells in your body. now visualize little cancer cells. now those big white cells are attacking the cancer cells... 
speaker2: i see them... i see the white cells...

speaker1: what was that all about? 
speaker2: it's visualization therapy. he's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
speaker1: he's an actor. i remember him in "the in-laws."
speaker2: uh, yes... that's true. but he's
speaker1: you must take a little pleasure in it.
speaker2: of course! but that doesn't mean i don't need everyone's support! i can't be surrounded by negative energy.
speaker1: andy, you're surrounded by what you create. you are the king of negative energy.
speaker2: y-yeah? well, then it has to stop! because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick i am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- i'm dead.
speaker1: so how can i help you...?
speaker2: i wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. the best show anybody's ever seen!
speaker1: do you wanna tour the clubs?
speaker2: no clubs. i wanna reach the top! carnegie hall...!

speaker1: i'm working on a great cover story: i've got a guy in the lab at cedars. he says andy kaufman is dying of lung cancer. 
speaker2: what no. no more kaufman stories! he's burned us too many times!
speaker3: yeah, he's definitely not dying. he's playing carnegie hall next month!
speaker1: only kaufman would use cancer as a publicity stunt.

speaker1: this is great. the crowd's gonna love this! hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive? 
speaker2: i dunno. if they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
speaker1: well, call sag. it'd be cool to get one on the show. i want the evening to build and build. it's gonna have the most incredible ending: singers, dancers, the "hallelujah chorus" -- then the sky opens, and santa claus comes flying down!
speaker2: and you say, "santa, what am i gettin' for christmas?" and he says, "cancer!"
speaker1: no! no no no! none of that! i want this show to be positive!
speaker3: that's great... but this show's gonna cost a fortune. even if it sells out, you'll still lose eighty grand.
speaker1: i don't care about the money. i just want the show to deliver.
speaker3: so who's gonna pay for it?
speaker1: tony clifton.
speaker3: you know tony doesn't have that kind of money.
speaker1: then he'll borrow it. i know tony better than you do. even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
speaker3: okay, andy. will do.

speaker1: ladies and gentlemen! i'm pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film, eleanor "cody" gould!! 
speaker2: andy... this is so overwhelming...
speaker1: well, it's gettin' even better! 'cause we found one of the original hobby horses! do you -- do you think you could treat us to a few steps from "jingle jangle jingle"?
speaker3: is there a doctor in the house??!

speaker1: now we'll place a blue crystal. very high vibrations. it's wonderful for it's healing powers. 
speaker2: okay. let's try two of those... and one of the pink ones.
speaker3: your friend is doing four crystal sessions a day, but it's just not helping.
speaker4: i know... the cancer's terminal.
speaker3: yes. that wasn't made particularly clear to us when he checked in...
speaker4: look, personally, i think rubbing rocks on people is a load of horseshit. but if it makes andy happy, that's all that matters.
speaker3: i'm sorry to sound crass -- but we don't want to be "that health resort in new mexico where andy kaufman died." i'm going to have to ask you to leave.

speaker1: what is this stuff? 
speaker2: it's all macrobiotic. millet, burdock root, kelp... andy says it'll purify him.
speaker3: what is that crap? looks like somethin' my dog would puke up!!
speaker3: how 'bout me and you dolls go get some real food: french fries and a porterhouse steak!
speaker2: ...andy...?
speaker3: i ain't andy! i'm tony! andy's sick -- pick, chick, kick, lick! the doctor says he's a goner. but tony's built like a mule! andy asked me to be his pallbearer! i'll do it for him! i'm getting stronger and stronger! here, watch this!
speaker2: stop it! c'mon, put that down.
speaker3: yeah, you're right. we better get movin'. we don't wanna miss happy hour at kelbos -- all the mai tai's you can drink for $4.99.
speaker4: andy!! shocked, they run over.
speaker3: dammit...

speaker1: i can't move my arm. 
speaker2: you've got good days and bad days.
speaker1: my hair is coming out.
speaker2: yeah...
speaker1: i've got an idea for a new tv show for me to star in. it's called "uncle andy's fun house" -- it'll be a saturday morning thing where i can goof off with the kids. you know, puppets, magic tricks...
speaker2: i think we can sell that. silence.
speaker1: hey... thanks for always backin' me.
speaker2: did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
