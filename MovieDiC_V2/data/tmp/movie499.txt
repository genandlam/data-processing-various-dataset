JAMAL: xl 5. mobile phones.
PREM: aha! so, you're the man who rings me up every single day of my life with special offers, huh?

JAMAL: i- i get tea for people and-

PREM: - a chi-wallah! why didn't you say? 
PREM: so, ladies and gentlemen, jamal malik from mumbai, let's play who wants to be a millionaire...!

INSPECTOR: has he confessed, yet? 
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS: apart from his name, i can't get a word out of the runt.
INSPECTOR: you've been here all night, srinivas. what have you been doing?
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS: tough guy.
INSPECTOR: a little electricity will loosen his tongue.
INSPECTOR: every night i get home, "why can't we have a/c like bajan chacha?

INSPECTOR: why don't you care about your poor family, dying in this heat." twenty-four years a policeman and i can't afford a/c. 
INSPECTOR: but you. you've got ten million rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar? and who knows how much further? fancy the twenty million, do you?
INSPECTOR: i think you probably do.
INSPECTOR: so. were you wired up? a mobile or a pager, correct? some little hidden gadget? no? a coughing accomplice in the audience? microchip under the skin, huh?
INSPECTOR: srinivas! look, it's hot, my wife is giving me hell, i've got a desk full of murderers, rapists, extortionists, assorted bum-bandits...and you. why don't you save us both a lot of time? hmm?
INSPECTOR OF POLICE: he's unconscious, chutiya. what good is that? how many times have i told you-?
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS: sorry, sir.

YOUNG CONSTABLE: he's coming! sir. 
INSPECTOR: arã© wa, srinivas, we'll have amnesty international in here next, peeing their pants about human rights. get him down, tidy him up, for sake.
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS: maybe he did know the answers.
INSPECTOR: have you gone soft, srinivas? professors, lawyers, doctors, general knowledge wallahs never get beyond sixteen thousand rupees. and he's on ten million? what the can a slum dog possibly know?
JAMAL: the answers.
JAMAL: i know the answers.

SALIM: vinod! musketeers coming through! 
WOMAN'S VOICE: jamal!
JAMAL: mummy-ji.
JAMAL'S MOTHER: don't you move a muscle.

MISTER NANDHA: so, the musketeers return. we are honoured. salim. or porthos, isn't it? 
SALIM: i know!
MISTER NANDHA: and athos.

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE: it is so kind of you to visit our station, sir. a great honour. 
PREM: not at all, not at all. i hope you will visit us, commissioner.

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE: oh! a thousand thanks, sir.

COMMISSIONER OF POLICE: chi, you lazy chutiyã©, chi! 
COMMISSIONER OF POLICE: ah, inspector! cracked it?
INSPECTOR: nearly, sir.
COMMISSIONER OF POLICE: nearly? nearly? when prem kumar himself has-
PREM: inspector. how good to meet you.
INSPECTOR: clearly, sir.
PREM: so, it is just a question of how, no?
INSPECTOR: indeed, sir. the proof. that is all we need.
PREM: we are lucky to have a man of your obvious experience on the case. this kid might run rings around us filmi types, but he won't make fools out of the mumbai police force, i can see that.
PREM: in front of sixty million people.

PREM: which is what will happen if we don't get a result, gentlemen. he goes back on the show to rob us all with the whole of india watching. but. i can rely on you. 
PREM: has he- has he made any allegations?
INSPECTOR: allegations?
PREM: he's a cunning one. a convincing liar. don't be taken in, inspector, don't be taken in.

INSPECTOR: so, mister malik, the man who knows the answers. talk. 
PREM: so, are you ready for your first question for one thousand rupees?
JAMAL: yes.
PREM: not bad money to sit in a chair and answer a question. better than making the tea, no?

JAMAL: no. yes. no. 
PREM: no. yes. no. apka final answer?
PREM: remember, you have three lifelines if you're not sure of your answer- ask the audience, 50/50 and phone a friend. so, the question:
PREM: who was the star of the 1973 hit film zanjeer. was it a- close on jamal's eyes.

SALIM: immediately, sir. 
SALIM: bhai, get out of there. prakash wants a
JAMAL O.S.: not finished.
PRAKASH: stop your time-pass. this is urgent.

JAMAL O.S.: it's a shy one. since when was there a time limit on a crap? 
SALIM: since there was a customer waiting, that's when.
JAMAL O.S.: come on out, you beauty, unveil yourself, my darling-warling....
PRAKASH: look, kid, i got a bad stomach. it's borderline....
PRAKASH: i'm off to devi's bog. give me that.
SALIM: you just lost me good money, you stupid idiot-
MAN: it's amitabh! that's his helicopter!
JAMAL O.S.: amitabh? amitabh bacchan?

JAMAL: wait! amitabh.... 
JAMAL: amitabh-ji! amitabh-ji!

JAMAL: you don't have to be a genius.
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS: i knew it was amitabh.
JAMAL: like i said.

JAMAL: he's the most famous man in india...! 
PREM O/S: for four thousand rupees....the national emblem of india is a picture of three lions. what is written underneath? is it...

PREM: what do we think, jamal? the most famous phrase in our country's history. maybe you want to phone a friend? 
PREM: or ask the audience? i have a hunch they might just know the answer. what do we think?
JAMAL: yes.
PREM: yes?
JAMAL: ask the audience.
PREM: well, you're the contestant, jamal.

PREM: put the poor man out of his misery, ladies and gentlemen. press your key-pad now. 
INSPECTOR: so, jamal. my five-year-old daughter knows the answer to that, but you don't. strange for a millionaire genius. what happened? your accomplice nip out for a piss, did he? or did he just not cough loud enough?
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS: the inspector asked you a question.
JAMAL: how much is bhelpuri at jeevan's stall on chowpatty beach?
INSPECTOR: what?
JAMAL: one bhelpuri. how much?
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS: ten rupees.
JAMAL: wrong. fifteen since divali. who stole constable varma's bicycle outside dadar station last thursday?
INSPECTOR: you know who that was?
JAMAL: everyone in juhu knows that. even five year-olds.

INSPECTOR: i'll give you five hundred rupees if you just admit it. you go home, i go home. everybody happy. 
INSPECTOR: no, you want to go back on the programme and win twenty million rupees, don't you?
JAMAL: wouldn't you?

PREM: are you married, jamal? 
JAMAL: no.
PREM: well, don't despair, there's someone out there who thinks our national motto is "fashion alone triumphs". you two could be very well matched.
DIRECTOR: what the is he playing at? he's way off script...

KRISHNA: they're muslims! him and him!
MOTHER: go!

JAMAL: salim! 
JAMAL: mister nandha.
MISTER NANDHA: ram nam satya hai, babri masjid dhvasth hai.
JAMAL: mister nandha?
MISTER NANDHA: we have destroyed your mosque. now, the followers of ram will drive you dogs out of our city.
MISTER NANDHA: ram has returned to his temple! ram has returned!

JAMAL: we should go back. 
JAMAL: see if ama-
JAMAL: what about jeevan chacha?
JAMAL: maybe he- salim shakes his head again.
SALIM: - i saw him. he was with them.
JAMAL: but he wouldn't hurt-
SALIM: - he was with them!
JAMAL: but-
SALIM: - shut up, jamal, can't you? just shut up!
SALIM: ja!
JAMAL: what shall we do?

SALIM: go away. ja, ja! 
SALIM: she'll have the security guard onto us, standing there.
JAMAL: not if we let her in.
SALIM: no.
JAMAL: she could be the third musketeer.
SALIM: i am the head of this family, now. and i say no. off, you.
SALIM: we don't even know what the third musketeer's called.

JAMAL: where's your mother? 
JAMAL: father?
JAMAL: i'm jamal. he's salim.
LATIKA: latika.

JAMAL: you're from the juhu slum, aren't you?
PREM: hmm? sure. know where i live now, kid? pali hill. twelve bedrooms, a/c in every room, two kitchens, a gym and a screening room. steel is what it takes, my friend, steel balls.
DIRECTOR V/O: prem? tone it down, for goodness sake. you're making him a laughing stock. prem glances up at the gallery with contempt.
PREM: we're having fun here. they love it...where the do you get them from?
DIRECTOR V/O: it's supposed to be a quiz show, not a blood sport.
FLOOR MANAGER: two minutes.

ADA: oh. 
JAMAL: and this, lady and gentleman, is burial place of mumtaz.
ADA: how did she die?
JAMAL: a road traffic accident.
ADA: really?
JAMAL: maximum pile-up.
PETER: i thought she died in child- birth.
JAMAL: exactly, sir. she was on the way to the hospital when it happened.

JAMAL: where are they? 
JAMAL: where did they go?
JAMAL: please, sir. which way?
SECURITY GUARD: i don't know and i don't care.
PREM V/O: ready for another question.

BARDI: she's already back.
TEACHER: bardi...jamal?
JAMAL: oh. well. she did come back, then she went away when alfie split up with her and now she's back again.

JAMAL: but it looks as if alfie still fancies mo after all, so- 
TEACHER: - thank you, jamal. keep up, bardi. the chi-wallah knows more than you.
TEACHER: okay, it's been super-duper hot for uk this week, so there'll be a lot of chat about that- they love their weather- and there's the festival in edinburgh- edinburgh?

EVERYONE: ...every call!

MANAGER: if they want an upgrade, a new tariff or we're stealing them from the other networks, you take the call. anything else- he mimes cutting his throat. 
MANAGER: no time-wasters on team bradford, kid. leave that to the homosexuals on tunbridge wells.
MANAGER: where've you been? dave on cornmarket's virtually lost his voice, there's two on ilkley moor who've had their hands up for hours. come on, move it!
DAVE: two minutes, jamal. i'm on "millionaire" duty.

DAVE: it's my turn, jamal. i've had my pee breaks. please. if he comes just keep your head down and pretend you're doing an upgrade on the-
JAMAL: - `friends and family'. i know.
JAMAL: two minutes.

OPERATORS: i'd like to be a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire. 
OPERATOR: bastard. i never get it.
JAMAL: you have to dial when prem says "if". "if you want the chance to be a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire..." that's when they open the lines.
JAMAL: that's what anjum in technical says. he put the system in.
OPERATOR: so why don't you?
WOMAN V/O: hello? hello? have i been transferred again, for sake?

WOMAN V/O: hello? will somebody talk to me? 
JAMAL: hello, mrs...
JAMAL: ...mackintosh from king gussie.
WOMAN V/O: it's kingussie, love. pronounced kinoosie.
JAMAL: kinoosie?
WOMAN V/O: so where are you from? abroad, i bet. china or somewhere. what good is-
JAMAL: - just down the road from your house, mrs mackintosh. next to the loch.
WOMAN V/O: oh aye? which loch?
JAMAL: loch big- loch ben. next door to detective taggart's flat.
WOMAN V/O: loch ben? och, no, hen, that's one of the wee ones up in the highlands. you're all the way up there? but i bet it rains, eh, hen?
JAMAL: indeed yes, mrs mackintosh. i have to wade through a metre of water every morning.
WOMAN V/O: no!

JAMAL: yes, yes, mrs mackintosh. in my kilt. 
WOMAN V/O: och, no, hen.
JAMAL: it's alright once i've had my porridge, my haggis and a few scotch whiskies- and the monsoon's nearly over, so-
WOMAN V/O: - and what monsoon would that be? i'd like to speak to your supervisor, son.
JAMAL: i don't think that's a good idea. he is a very important man, mrs mackintosh-
WOMAN V/O: - get me the supervisor on this line now-
JAMAL: - and he doesn't like time wasters.
MAN V/O: yeah?
JAMAL: salim?
MAN V/O: who wants to know? do you know what time it is?

JAMAL: hello, salim.

PREM: ever been to cambridge? 
JAMAL: no.
PREM: ever been to the circus?

JAMAL: no. and i've never been to uk before. but i'll still have a go. 
JAMAL: why not?
PREM: can someone call me an ambulance?

JAMAL: i can't remember. 
PREM: you can't remember. does that mean you did know? once?

JAMAL: i don't think it's oxford. 
PREM: based on your extensive travelling, right?
JAMAL: well, oxford has broad street, saint aldates, turl street, queen street, the high and magdalene bridge- which is pronounced maudlin, so-
PREM: i thought you hadn't been to uk.
JAMAL: oh, i haven't. and it's not leeds, because that's elland road, kirkgate market, commercial street, st peter's-
PREM: - what might it be then, jamal?
JAMAL: well, i don't think it's cambridge.
PREM: cambridge circus is not in cambridge? dare i ask why?
JAMAL: too obvious. there's definitely an oxford circus in london, and there's a rowing race between oxford and cambridge so there's probably a cambridge circus too.
PREM: that's the logic that's got him this far, ladies and gentlemen. who are we to argue? so. jamal.
JAMAL: if the gods are with me...final answer. d.

PREM: computer-ji, d lock kiya-jaye. 
PREM: it's been a rollercoaster ride all the way, a pleasure to have you on the show, my friend, but i'm sorry to say that you're....incredibly, absolutely right!
PREM: ladies and gentlemen, jamal malik, the man with two and a half million rupees!
PREM: a few hours ago, you were fetching tea for the phone- wallahs. now you are richer than they ever will ever be. what a player, ladies and gentleman! what a player.

PREM: final answer? 
JAMAL: final answer.
PREM: you had two and a half million rupees. if i may-?
PREM: ladies and gentlemen, the chi- wallah has done it again! d. is right! incredible!

INSPECTOR: not that incredible. you'd just murdered somebody with a colt 45, after all. 
JAMAL: it was self-defence.
INSPECTOR: let's call it manslaughter, then, shall we?

PREM: getting hot in here, isn't it? 
JAMAL: are you nervous?
PREM: what? am i nervous? you're the one who's in the hot seat, my friend.

DIRECTOR: hell. he's got prem on the run... 
PREM: what sports do you play?
JAMAL: none.
PREM: you've got a cheque for five million rupees in your hands. you've still got two life-lines, phone a friend and 50/50. for ten million rupees: pay, play, or bail out. it's still an option. remember, if you get the answer wrong, you will lose everything like that.
PREM: are you sure you want to do this?

JAMAL: i'll play. 
PREM: the dreams of so many. on the floor.

SALIM: jamal!

JAMAL: javed mehta? the gangster from our slum? you work for him?
SALIM: who else would protect us from maman's gang, huh?
JAMAL: what do you do for him?
SALIM: anything he asks.

SALIM: he is coming. you must go. my card. 
JAMAL: what for?
SALIM: you think i am going to let you out of my sight again, little brother? you stay with me now.
JAMAL: salim, where's latika?
SALIM: still? she's gone, jamal. long gone. now go. quick.

JAMAL V/O: sometimes the opposite. 
SALIM: aã© khuda mujhã© baksh dã© mainã© bahut gunaah kiyã© hain....
JAMAL V/O: but younger brothers don't interfere. mostly.

JAMAL: baba, i am the new cook from the agency. a thousand apologies, i am late for the memsaab. 
DOOR-KEEPER: she doesn't know anything about any cook. there's supposed to be a dishwasher being delivered.

JAMAL: baba, i am your dishwasher! 
LATIKA: haven't i told you, don't interrupt when i'm watching- she looks at jamal. is silenced briefly.
LATIKA: - come inside. i'll show you the kitchen.

LATIKA: jamal, jamal, look at you...! their heads are close, they might kiss. then latika turns away, stares out of the window. 
LATIKA: arã© wa, jamal....
JAMAL: you've hurt your eye.
LATIKA: why are you here?
JAMAL: to see you.
LATIKA: well. you see me.
JAMAL: why does everyone love this programme?

LATIKA: it's the chance to escape, isn't it? walk into another life. 
JAMAL: you have another life. a rich one.
LATIKA: who'd have thought it possible?
JAMAL: are you happy?
LATIKA: i have five star food, five star clothes. i sleep in a bed, not on the street. from where we come from, jamal, that is happiness.
JAMAL: you don't look so happy with a black eye.
LATIKA: you turn up here out of nowhere, telling me i'm not happy: how dare you?
LATIKA: javed will kill you. here.
JAMAL: javed? you are with him?
JAVED: first you want a dishwasher, now a cook-
LATIKA: -i just thought-
JAVED: - chup. the cricket's on.
JAVED: why do you always watch that huh? i'm already a millionaire.

JAVED: well, come on then, cook. i'm hungry. get me a sandwich. 
JAMAL: immediately, sir.
JAVED: atcha...
JAMAL: come away with me.

JAMAL: love.
JAVED: ..yeah. he's on eighty-five. i want four lakh on him making a century. what are you giving?...okay, make it five lakh.
TV COMMENTATOR: we are watching history unfold today at the wankhedã© stadium as sachin tendulkar carves his way towards another magnificent century and the record books. his thirty-eighth century- the most by any indian cricketer ever...
LATIKA: love. that will feed us, will it?
JAMAL: it won't buy you a new dishwasher, but it might make you happy.

LATIKA: where have you been? get in the real world, jamal. 
JAMAL: you and me. that is the real world. come away with me.
LATIKA: you're crazy.

JAVED: no, no, no! stupid ben chod idiot...
JAVED: and what is this supposed to be, mader chod? get out. get out!

LATIKA: now go, before he kills us both. 
JAVED: latika, where's my shirt? the armani.

LATIKA: so what, jamal? so what? now, get out and tell your no- good agency not to send anybody else until they've learnt to cook. you hear?
DOOR-KEEPER: madam, your dishwasher has arrived. leaning over the sink, latika weeps silently.

SALIM: why can't you let it alone? you want money, i'll give you money. 
JAMAL: you know what i want.
SALIM: you're like some crazy man- you're obsessed.
JAMAL: she is my destiny, salim.
SALIM: know what your destiny is, crazy boy? a bullet between the eyes. and after that, he'll kill her.
JAMAL: me, i don't care. latika? she's already half dead.
SALIM: yes. about that, you are right.
JAMAL: you sold her.
SALIM: i didn't sell her. javed wanted her. he gets what he wants.

PREM: you've said that before, yaar. prem finishes pissing. goes over to the washbasins, runs the taps and washes his hands. 
JAMAL O/S: no, i really don't.
PREM: what? you can't take the money and run now. you're on the edge of history, kid!
JAMAL O/S: i don't see what else i can do.
