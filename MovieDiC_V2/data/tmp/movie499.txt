speaker3: yes.
speaker1: ...three, two, one, zero. cue prem, cue applause...

speaker1: go, prem. 
speaker2: welcome to who wants to be a millionaire!
speaker2: please give a warm welcome to our first contestant of the night- a local from our very own mumbai!
speaker2: smile, dammit.

speaker1: your name, bhen chod. 
speaker1: your name!
speaker2: jamal malik.

speaker1: so, jamal, tell us a bit about yourself. 
speaker2: i work in a call centre. in juhu.

speaker1: a phone-basher! and what type of call centre would this be? 
speaker2: xl 5. mobile phones.
speaker1: aha! so, you're the man who rings me up every single day of my life with special offers, huh?
speaker2: no, actually, i'm an assistant.
speaker1: an assistant phone-basher?
speaker1: and what does an assistant phone- basher do, exactly?
speaker2: i- i get tea for people and-

speaker1: - a chi-wallah! why didn't you say? 
speaker1: so, ladies and gentlemen, jamal malik from mumbai, let's play who wants to be a millionaire...!

speaker1: has he confessed, yet? 
speaker2: apart from his name, i can't get a word out of the runt.
speaker1: you've been here all night, srinivas. what have you been doing?
speaker2: tough guy.
speaker1: a little electricity will loosen his tongue.
speaker1: every night i get home, "why can't we have a/c like bajan chacha?

speaker1: why don't you care about your poor family, dying in this heat." twenty-four years a policeman and i can't afford a/c. 
speaker1: but you. you've got ten million rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar? and who knows how much further? fancy the twenty million, do you?
speaker1: i think you probably do.
speaker1: so. were you wired up? a mobile or a pager, correct? some little hidden gadget? no? a coughing accomplice in the audience? microchip under the skin, huh?
speaker1: srinivas! look, it's hot, my wife is giving me hell, i've got a desk full of murderers, rapists, extortionists, assorted bum-bandits...and you. why don't you save us both a lot of time? hmm?
speaker2: he's unconscious, chutiya. what good is that? how many times have i told you-?
speaker3: sorry, sir.

speaker1: he's coming! sir. 
speaker2: arã© wa, srinivas, we'll have amnesty international in here next, peeing their pants about human rights. get him down, tidy him up, for sake.
speaker3: maybe he did know the answers.
speaker2: have you gone soft, srinivas? professors, lawyers, doctors, general knowledge wallahs never get beyond sixteen thousand rupees. and he's on ten million? what the can a slum dog possibly know?
speaker4: the answers.
speaker4: i know the answers.

speaker1: vinod! musketeers coming through! 
speaker2: jamal!
speaker3: mummy-ji.
speaker4: don't you move a muscle.
speaker4: thank you, mister gupta. i will deal with these two.

speaker1: so, the musketeers return. we are honoured. salim. or porthos, isn't it? 
speaker2: i know!
speaker1: and athos.

speaker1: it is so kind of you to visit our station, sir. a great honour. 
speaker2: not at all, not at all. i hope you will visit us, commissioner.
speaker2: bring the family. it's a lot of fun.
speaker1: oh! a thousand thanks, sir.

speaker1: chi, you lazy chutiyã©, chi! 
speaker1: ah, inspector! cracked it?
speaker2: nearly, sir.
speaker1: nearly? nearly? when prem kumar himself has-
speaker3: inspector. how good to meet you.
speaker2: clearly, sir.
speaker3: so, it is just a question of how, no?
speaker2: indeed, sir. the proof. that is all we need.
speaker3: we are lucky to have a man of your obvious experience on the case. this kid might run rings around us filmi types, but he won't make fools out of the mumbai police force, i can see that.
speaker3: in front of sixty million people.

speaker1: which is what will happen if we don't get a result, gentlemen. he goes back on the show to rob us all with the whole of india watching. but. i can rely on you. 
speaker1: has he- has he made any allegations?
speaker2: allegations?
speaker1: he's a cunning one. a convincing liar. don't be taken in, inspector, don't be taken in.

speaker1: so, mister malik, the man who knows the answers. talk. 
speaker2: so, are you ready for your first question for one thousand rupees?
speaker3: yes.
speaker2: not bad money to sit in a chair and answer a question. better than making the tea, no?

speaker1: no. yes. no. 
speaker2: no. yes. no. apka final answer?
speaker2: remember, you have three lifelines if you're not sure of your answer- ask the audience, 50/50 and phone a friend. so, the question:
speaker2: who was the star of the 1973 hit film zanjeer. was it a- close on jamal's eyes.

speaker1: immediately, sir. 
speaker1: bhai, get out of there. prakash wants a
speaker2: not finished.
speaker3: stop your time-pass. this is urgent.

speaker1: it's a shy one. since when was there a time limit on a crap? 
speaker2: since there was a customer waiting, that's when.
speaker1: come on out, you beauty, unveil yourself, my darling-warling....
speaker3: look, kid, i got a bad stomach. it's borderline....
speaker3: i'm off to devi's bog. give me that.
speaker2: you just lost me good money, you stupid idiot-
speaker4: it's amitabh! that's his helicopter!
speaker1: amitabh? amitabh bacchan?

speaker1: wait! amitabh.... 
speaker1: amitabh-ji! amitabh-ji!
speaker1: please. amitabh-ji.
speaker1: a thousand thanks, amitabh-ji.

speaker1: it's coming! 
speaker2: amitabh, amitabh, oh amitabh!

speaker1: i have your autograph, oh, holy amitabh! 
speaker2: here it comes!

speaker1: you chose a- amitabh bacchan. guess what? you just won one thousand rupees! 
speaker2: you don't have to be a genius.
speaker3: i knew it was amitabh.
speaker2: like i said.

speaker1: he's the most famous man in india...! 
speaker2: for four thousand rupees....the national emblem of india is a picture of three lions. what is written underneath? is it...

speaker1: what do we think, jamal? the most famous phrase in our country's history. maybe you want to phone a friend? 
speaker1: or ask the audience? i have a hunch they might just know the answer. what do we think?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: yes?
speaker2: ask the audience.
speaker1: well, you're the contestant, jamal.

speaker1: put the poor man out of his misery, ladies and gentlemen. press your key-pad now. 
speaker2: so, jamal. my five-year-old daughter knows the answer to that, but you don't. strange for a millionaire genius. what happened? your accomplice nip out for a piss, did he? or did he just not cough loud enough?
speaker3: the inspector asked you a question.
speaker4: how much is bhelpuri at jeevan's stall on chowpatty beach?
speaker2: what?
speaker4: one bhelpuri. how much?
speaker3: ten rupees.
speaker4: wrong. fifteen since divali. who stole constable varma's bicycle outside dadar station last thursday?
speaker2: you know who that was?
speaker4: everyone in juhu knows that. even five year-olds.

speaker1: i'll give you five hundred rupees if you just admit it. you go home, i go home. everybody happy. 
speaker1: no, you want to go back on the programme and win twenty million rupees, don't you?
speaker2: wouldn't you?

speaker1: are you married, jamal? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: well, don't despair, there's someone out there who thinks our national motto is "fashion alone triumphs". you two could be very well matched.
speaker3: what the is he playing at? he's way off script...
speaker4: split up with his girl-friend.

speaker1: which one? 
speaker2: all three, i heard. nita as well. back with the wife. she's pregnant again.
speaker1: oh, that's all we need....
speaker2: oh, for sharukh khan...stand by white out.

speaker1: ...won four thousand rupees! 
speaker1: one more question before the commercial break. what will our call centre assistant do next?

speaker1: it's going to come. today. i can feel it. 
speaker2: hope so. my head is exploding.

speaker1: yes. we need rain. 
speaker1: run! jamal, salim, run!
speaker1: go! run!
speaker2: krishna, quick!
speaker3: no way! you're a muslim. get away from me!
speaker3: they're muslims! him and him!
speaker1: go!

speaker1: salim! 
speaker1: mister nandha.
speaker2: ram nam satya hai, babri masjid dhvasth hai.
speaker1: mister nandha?
speaker2: we have destroyed your mosque. now, the followers of ram will drive you dogs out of our city.
speaker2: ram has returned to his temple! ram has returned!

speaker1: we should go back. 
speaker1: see if ama-
speaker1: what about jeevan chacha?
speaker1: maybe he- salim shakes his head again.
speaker2: - i saw him. he was with them.
speaker1: but he wouldn't hurt-
speaker2: - he was with them!
speaker1: but-
speaker2: - shut up, jamal, can't you? just shut up!
speaker2: ja!
speaker1: what shall we do?

speaker1: go away. ja, ja! 
speaker1: she'll have the security guard onto us, standing there.
speaker2: not if we let her in.
speaker1: no.
speaker2: she could be the third musketeer.
speaker1: i am the head of this family, now. and i say no. off, you.
speaker1: we don't even know what the third musketeer's called.

speaker1: where's your mother? 
speaker1: father?
speaker1: i'm jamal. he's salim.
speaker2: latika.
speaker1: i wake up every morning wishing i didn't know the answer to that question? if it wasn't for ram and allah, i would still have a mother.

speaker1: final answer? 
speaker2: final answer.
speaker1: computer-ji, d lock kiya-jaye.

speaker1: jamal malik, you answered d? ram is depicted with a bow and arrow in his hand. and guess what? you've just won sixteen thousand rupees! well done, my friend. time for a commercial break- don't go away, now. 
speaker1: got lucky, huh? i'd take the money. you'll never get the next one.
speaker2: you're from the juhu slum, aren't you?
speaker1: hmm? sure. know where i live now, kid? pali hill. twelve bedrooms, a/c in every room, two kitchens, a gym and a screening room. steel is what it takes, my friend, steel balls.
speaker3: prem? tone it down, for goodness sake. you're making him a laughing stock. prem glances up at the gallery with contempt.
speaker1: we're having fun here. they love it...where the do you get them from?
speaker3: it's supposed to be a quiz show, not a blood sport.
speaker4: two minutes.

speaker1: meet me after the show. please. 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: nita, i can explain.
speaker2: no need. i read it in stardust. didn't even have the to tell me. "prem's happiness with another baby on the way". after everything you said...
speaker1: baby, it all happened before i met you. i swear to you.
speaker2: she's got the gestation period of an elephant, then.
speaker1: you see? amidst all this misery, only you can make me laugh.
speaker2: all this misery...
speaker1: her and i- nothing. you have to believe me, baby...
speaker3: one minute.

speaker1: no. i'm not going on. 
speaker2: prem...

speaker3: fifteen.
speaker2: alright.
speaker1: steel balls.

speaker3: pretty was she?
speaker3: guess not.
speaker1: the most beautiful woman in the world.
speaker4: well, well. the slum dog barks. money or women. the reason for most mistakes in life. looks like you got mixed up with both. srinivas, you need the exercise: a trip to vt station to check on the statue. and lock your bike up.

speaker1: that's the chutiyã© out the way. now, man to man. how did you know all the answers? 
speaker2: if i knew, i'd tell you.

speaker1: triple if it's crying.

speaker1: you're dead, sala. 
speaker2: get back to bed, dogs! what the hell...

speaker4: and why would they do that, i wonder?

speaker1: very good, very good. i am pleased, arvind. he is ready. 
speaker2: ready?
speaker3: salim!

speaker1: okay. take him out the back. punnoose picks up arvind and carries him out. 
speaker1: now the other one. salim, go get jamal.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: gunfighter number one, isn't that right, salim? the money, the women, the cars...you want them bad, huh? and why not?
speaker1: the time has come to choose, yaar. the life of a slum dog or the life of a man. a real man. a gunfighter, salim.
speaker1: your destiny is in your hands, bhai. you can be me. or nobody.
speaker2: yes, maman.
speaker1: so, brother, go get jamal.

speaker1: that's what arvind said. on harbour road. you, me and salim.
speaker2: harbour road! we can have ice cream from babanji's.
speaker1: every day if we want.

speaker1: arã©, jamal... 
speaker1: come.
speaker2: where you going?
speaker1: first class, bhai. where else?

speaker1: salim? is this heaven?

speaker3: - so much waiting around in this country.

speaker1: no, i- 
speaker2: - we're on a very tight schedule, you see, young man. have to see the red fort this afternoon. would it be possible to show us around now? obviously we understand it would cost more for just the two of us...
speaker1: but of course, madam. please follow me.
speaker1: this is....the taj mahal.
speaker1: the taj mahal was built by the emperor khurram for his wife mumtaz who was maximum beautiful woman in the whole world. when she died, the emperor decided to build this five star hotel for everyone who wanted to visit her tomb...but he died in- in fifteen eighty-seven, before any of the rooms were built. or the lifts. the swimming pool, however, as you can see was completed on schedule in top class fashion.
speaker2: it says nothing of this in the guide book.
speaker1: with respect, madam, the guide book is written by a bunch of lazy, good-for-nothing, indian beggars.

speaker1: oh. 
speaker2: and this, lady and gentleman, is burial place of mumtaz.
speaker1: how did she die?
speaker2: a road traffic accident.
speaker1: really?
speaker2: maximum pile-up.
speaker3: i thought she died in child- birth.
speaker2: exactly, sir. she was on the way to the hospital when it happened.
speaker1: you've seen the way they drive around here...

speaker1: it was the best-paid job i've ever had. 
speaker2: this is the princess diana seat, madam. allow me.
speaker3: tourist police!

speaker1: they say that every man in uttar pradesh is wearing a kurta that has been washed here at least one time. 
speaker2: is that so? that's amazing.
speaker3: arã©, sala! formula one, formula one! pit-stop ka speed, schumacher ka ishtyle
speaker3: go, go!
speaker2: woah. what happened here?
speaker4: i give you two tight slaps, mader chod!
speaker1: i don't know! i didn't do it, did i...? nothing to do with me...get off!
speaker5: do something, clark.
speaker2: well, i- i dunno, i-

speaker1: okay, okay, just cool it. you're insured, aren't you? 
speaker1: you okay?
speaker2: you wanted to see the `real india', mister david. here it is.
speaker3: well, here's a bit of the real america, too, son.

speaker1: it's called orfeo. orpheus and eurydice. orpheus- that one there- is looking for his lover, eurydice. she died, but he can't live without her. 
speaker1: the pain is so bad that he goes to the underworld- the place we go when we die- to try to get her back.
speaker2: you can't do that. can you?
speaker1: you can in opera.
speaker2: does he find her?
speaker1: watch and see.

speaker1: woah! what are you- jamal? 
speaker2: we have to go, salim.
speaker1: go? go where?

speaker1: bombay. 
speaker2: don't be stupid. we're making good money here.
speaker1: we should have gone a long time ago.
speaker2: oh, baby brother's in love.
speaker1: latika was one of us. a musketeer.
speaker2: a musketeer...grow up, jamal. look, how was i to know they'd beat you up. here, you can have some of the cash. come on...
speaker1: i've got cash.
speaker1: dollars.
speaker2: how much?
speaker1: enough. i'm getting my stuff.
speaker2: wait! jamal! ah,
speaker3: so, my friend: ready for another question.

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: pay or play, jamal? all you have to do is stop now and you walk away with a cool quarter of a million rupees. decide to play, get the answer wrong and you walk away with absolutely nothing. but, get the answer right and you win a million rupees. so. you decide. pay or play?

speaker1: okay, he hasn't got a clue. this is going to be a walk-away. 
speaker2: no, he's going to play with him, first.

speaker1: get a lot of hundred dollar bills in your line of work, jamal? 
speaker2: the minimum tip for my services.

speaker1: now i know why my cell phone bill is so high...they pay the chi-wallah in hundred dollar bills!

speaker1: you certainly have. c. right?
speaker2: right. c.

speaker1: jamal malik- you chose to play not pay. i'm afraid you no longer have two hundred and fifty thousand rupees....

speaker1: who's on the thousand rupee note? 
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: it's gandhi!
speaker2: i've heard of him.
speaker1: don't get clever or i'll get the electricity out again.
speaker2: they didn't ask me that question. i don't know why. ask them.
speaker1: funny, you don't seem that interested in money.

speaker1: accessory to murder, sir.
speaker2: only the finest minds in the mumbai police force.
speaker2: go check the files, constable.
speaker2: you puzzle me, slumdog. admitting murder to avoid a charge of fraud is not exactly clever thinking. now, why would you do that?

speaker1: where are they? 
speaker1: where did they go?
speaker1: please, sir. which way?
speaker2: i don't know and i don't care.
speaker3: ready for another question.
speaker4: yes. i'm ready.

speaker1: okay, guys, it's been a big week in uk. kat is back. 
speaker2: she's already back.
speaker1: bardi...jamal?
speaker3: oh. well. she did come back, then she went away when alfie split up with her and now she's back again.

speaker1: but it looks as if alfie still fancies mo after all, so- 
speaker2: - thank you, jamal. keep up, bardi. the chi-wallah knows more than you.
speaker2: okay, it's been super-duper hot for uk this week, so there'll be a lot of chat about that- they love their weather- and there's the festival in edinburgh- edinburgh?
speaker3: scotland. kilts, castles, err, haggis? porridge, the highlands, mountains. ben- ben nevis?
speaker4: detective taggart. whisky, sean connery!
speaker2: and lochs. their word for lakes. good. it's also double bonus time for an upgrade to the `friends and family' package this week, so remember to push for an upgrade...
speaker5: ...every call!

speaker1: if they want an upgrade, a new tariff or we're stealing them from the other networks, you take the call. anything else- he mimes cutting his throat. 
speaker1: no time-wasters on team bradford, kid. leave that to the homosexuals on tunbridge wells.
speaker1: where've you been? dave on cornmarket's virtually lost his voice, there's two on ilkley moor who've had their hands up for hours. come on, move it!
speaker2: two minutes, jamal. i'm on "millionaire" duty.
speaker3: rajneesh...
speaker2: it's my turn, jamal. i've had my pee breaks. please. if he comes just keep your head down and pretend you're doing an upgrade on the-
speaker3: - `friends and family'. i know.
speaker3: two minutes.

speaker1: i'd like to be a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire. 
speaker2: bastard. i never get it.
speaker3: you have to dial when prem says "if". "if you want the chance to be a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire..." that's when they open the lines.
speaker3: that's what anjum in technical says. he put the system in.
speaker2: so why don't you?
speaker4: hello? hello? have i been transferred again, for sake?

speaker1: hello? will somebody talk to me? 
speaker2: hello, mrs...
speaker2: ...mackintosh from king gussie.
speaker1: it's kingussie, love. pronounced kinoosie.
speaker2: kinoosie?
speaker1: so where are you from? abroad, i bet. china or somewhere. what good is-
speaker2: - just down the road from your house, mrs mackintosh. next to the loch.
speaker1: oh aye? which loch?
speaker2: loch big- loch ben. next door to detective taggart's flat.
speaker1: loch ben? och, no, hen, that's one of the wee ones up in the highlands. you're all the way up there? but i bet it rains, eh, hen?
speaker2: indeed yes, mrs mackintosh. i have to wade through a metre of water every morning.
speaker1: no!

speaker1: yes, yes, mrs mackintosh. in my kilt. 
speaker2: och, no, hen.
speaker1: it's alright once i've had my porridge, my haggis and a few scotch whiskies- and the monsoon's nearly over, so-
speaker2: - and what monsoon would that be? i'd like to speak to your supervisor, son.
speaker1: i don't think that's a good idea. he is a very important man, mrs mackintosh-
speaker2: - get me the supervisor on this line now-
speaker1: - and he doesn't like time wasters.
speaker3: yeah?
speaker1: salim?
speaker3: who wants to know? do you know what time it is?

speaker1: huh. hello? 
speaker2: hello? hello? who is this?
speaker2: hey. is someone with me?
speaker2: who is this?
speaker3: i am calling from xl 5 communications sir. as a valued customer, we are offering you a free upgrade with our `friends and- jamal's voice peters out.
speaker3: family.
speaker2: jamal? is that you? brother? where are you, man?...i thought you were dead or something...we had to go, jamal. maman's guys. they were searching the hotel...jamal, say something. please.
speaker3: hello, salim.

speaker1: ever been to cambridge? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: ever been to the circus?

speaker1: no. and i've never been to uk before. but i'll still have a go. 
speaker1: why not?
speaker2: can someone call me an ambulance?

speaker1: i can't remember. 
speaker2: you can't remember. does that mean you did know? once?

speaker1: i don't think it's oxford. 
speaker2: based on your extensive travelling, right?
speaker1: well, oxford has broad street, saint aldates, turl street, queen street, the high and magdalene bridge- which is pronounced maudlin, so-
speaker2: i thought you hadn't been to uk.
speaker1: oh, i haven't. and it's not leeds, because that's elland road, kirkgate market, commercial street, st peter's-
speaker2: - what might it be then, jamal?
speaker1: well, i don't think it's cambridge.
speaker2: cambridge circus is not in cambridge? dare i ask why?
speaker1: too obvious. there's definitely an oxford circus in london, and there's a rowing race between oxford and cambridge so there's probably a cambridge circus too.
speaker2: that's the logic that's got him this far, ladies and gentlemen. who are we to argue? so. jamal.
speaker1: if the gods are with me...final answer. d.

speaker1: computer-ji, d lock kiya-jaye. 
speaker1: it's been a rollercoaster ride all the way, a pleasure to have you on the show, my friend, but i'm sorry to say that you're....incredibly, absolutely right!
speaker1: ladies and gentlemen, jamal malik, the man with two and a half million rupees!
speaker1: a few hours ago, you were fetching tea for the phone- wallahs. now you are richer than they ever will ever be. what a player, ladies and gentleman! what a player.

speaker1: final answer? 
speaker2: final answer.
speaker1: you had two and a half million rupees. if i may-?
speaker1: ladies and gentlemen, the chi- wallah has done it again! d. is right! incredible!

speaker1: not that incredible. you'd just murdered somebody with a colt 45, after all. 
speaker2: it was self-defence.
speaker1: let's call it manslaughter, then, shall we?

speaker1: getting hot in here, isn't it? 
speaker2: are you nervous?
speaker1: what? am i nervous? you're the one who's in the hot seat, my friend.

speaker1: hell. he's got prem on the run... 
speaker2: what sports do you play?
speaker3: none.
speaker2: you've got a cheque for five million rupees in your hands. you've still got two life-lines, phone a friend and 50/50. for ten million rupees: pay, play, or bail out. it's still an option. remember, if you get the answer wrong, you will lose everything like that.
speaker2: are you sure you want to do this?

speaker1: i'll play. 
speaker2: the dreams of so many. on the floor.

speaker1: jamal! 
speaker1: is good, bhai. is good.
speaker1: maman's boys were after us. had to skip.
speaker2: liar.

speaker1: left a message at reception. 
speaker2: there was no message at reception.
speaker1: bhai, i left a message.
speaker2: i will never forgive you.
speaker1: i know.

speaker1: can you believe it? this was our slum. we lived just there, huh? now it is business, apartments, call centres...fuck usa, china. india is at the centre of the world, now, bhai. and i am at the centre of the centre, jamal. this is all javed-bhai's. 
speaker2: javed mehta? the gangster from our slum? you work for him?
speaker1: who else would protect us from maman's gang, huh?
speaker2: what do you do for him?
speaker1: anything he asks.

speaker1: he is coming. you must go. my card. 
speaker2: what for?
speaker1: you think i am going to let you out of my sight again, little brother? you stay with me now.
speaker2: salim, where's latika?
speaker1: still? she's gone, jamal. long gone. now go. quick.

speaker1: sometimes the opposite. 
speaker2: aã© khuda mujhã© baksh dã© mainã© bahut gunaah kiyã© hain....
speaker1: but younger brothers don't interfere. mostly.

speaker1: baba, i am the new cook from the agency. a thousand apologies, i am late for the memsaab. 
speaker2: she doesn't know anything about any cook. there's supposed to be a dishwasher being delivered.

speaker1: baba, i am your dishwasher! 
speaker2: haven't i told you, don't interrupt when i'm watching- she looks at jamal. is silenced briefly.
speaker2: - come inside. i'll show you the kitchen.

speaker1: jamal, jamal, look at you...! their heads are close, they might kiss. then latika turns away, stares out of the window. 
speaker1: arã© wa, jamal....
speaker2: you've hurt your eye.
speaker1: why are you here?
speaker2: to see you.
speaker1: well. you see me.
speaker2: why does everyone love this programme?

speaker1: it's the chance to escape, isn't it? walk into another life. 
speaker2: you have another life. a rich one.
speaker1: who'd have thought it possible?
speaker2: are you happy?
speaker1: i have five star food, five star clothes. i sleep in a bed, not on the street. from where we come from, jamal, that is happiness.
speaker2: you don't look so happy with a black eye.
speaker1: you turn up here out of nowhere, telling me i'm not happy: how dare you?
speaker1: javed will kill you. here.
speaker2: javed? you are with him?
speaker3: first you want a dishwasher, now a cook-
speaker1: -i just thought-
speaker3: - chup. the cricket's on.
speaker3: why do you always watch that huh? i'm already a millionaire.

speaker1: well, come on then, cook. i'm hungry. get me a sandwich. 
speaker2: immediately, sir.
speaker1: atcha...
speaker2: come away with me.
speaker3: chutiyã©. away where? and live on what? what can you provide? what have you got, jamal?
speaker2: love.
speaker1: ..yeah. he's on eighty-five. i want four lakh on him making a century. what are you giving?...okay, make it five lakh.
speaker4: we are watching history unfold today at the wankhedã© stadium as sachin tendulkar carves his way towards another magnificent century and the record books. his thirty-eighth century- the most by any indian cricketer ever...
speaker3: love. that will feed us, will it?
speaker2: it won't buy you a new dishwasher, but it might make you happy.

speaker1: where have you been? get in the real world, jamal. 
speaker2: you and me. that is the real world. come away with me.
speaker1: you're crazy.
speaker2: salim will help us.
speaker1: salim? you still believe in salim? jamal...i'll be gone soon, anyway. bombay's got too dangerous for- she indicates javed.
speaker2: where?
speaker1: you think he'd tell me?
speaker3: straight bat, straight bat, dammit.
speaker3: no! a single!
speaker3: no, no, no! stupid ben chod idiot...
speaker3: and what is this supposed to be, mader chod? get out. get out!

speaker1: now go, before he kills us both. 
speaker2: latika, where's my shirt? the armani.
speaker1: coming!
speaker1: you want to do something for me?
speaker3: anything.
speaker1: then forget me.
speaker3: i'll wait at vt station. five o'clock every day until you come.
speaker3: i love you.
speaker1: so what, jamal? so what? now, get out and tell your no- good agency not to send anybody else until they've learnt to cook. you hear?
speaker4: madam, your dishwasher has arrived. leaning over the sink, latika weeps silently.

speaker1: why can't you let it alone? you want money, i'll give you money. 
speaker2: you know what i want.
speaker1: you're like some crazy man- you're obsessed.
speaker2: she is my destiny, salim.
speaker1: know what your destiny is, crazy boy? a bullet between the eyes. and after that, he'll kill her.
speaker2: me, i don't care. latika? she's already half dead.
speaker1: yes. about that, you are right.
speaker2: you sold her.
speaker1: i didn't sell her. javed wanted her. he gets what he wants.
speaker1: she's doing alright. get it into your thick head, jamal. she's not yours and she never will be.

speaker1: you've got the luck of the devil, yaar, i'll give you that. 
speaker2: i- i need to-
speaker1: oh, the toilet. sure. naveed, jamal wants the bog.

speaker1: a guy from the slums becomes a millionaire overnight. you know the only other person who's done that? me. i know what it's like. 
speaker2: i'm not going to become a milionaire. i don't know the answer.

speaker1: you've said that before, yaar. prem finishes pissing. goes over to the washbasins, runs the taps and washes his hands. 
speaker2: no, i really don't.
speaker1: what? you can't take the money and run now. you're on the edge of history, kid!
speaker2: i don't see what else i can do.
speaker1: maybe it is written, my friend. you're going to win this. trust me, you're going to win.

speaker1: latika! 
speaker1: latika! latika!
speaker1: latika! latika!

speaker1: fifteen seconds.

speaker2: five seconds.
speaker1: almost.
speaker2: four, three...
speaker1: from rags to raja. it's your destiny.
speaker2: ...we're on.
speaker3: i know it isn't sachin tendulkar.
speaker1: that's a start. so, it could be ricky ponting, jack hobbs or michael slater.
speaker3: i'll use a life-line. fifty- fifty.
speaker1: okay. computer, take away two wrong answers.

speaker1: a barely perceptible jump from prem. 
speaker2: d. jack hobbs.
speaker3: do you know?
speaker3: so it could be b, ricky ponting?
speaker2: or d. jack hobbs.
speaker3: final answer?

speaker2: not really, but...maybe it is written, no?
speaker1: maybe, indeed. okay, okay. for twenty million rupees, the final question on who wants to be a millionaire?
speaker1: ohhhhh! just when i thought i would need a pacemaker fitted, we're out of time! what a show, ladies and gentlemen, what a show. join us tomorrow night to see if jamal malik has made the biggest mistake of his life or has just won the biggest prize in the history of indian television....same place, same time. you wouldn't dare miss it. goodnight!

speaker2: he's a cheat.
speaker1: this was you? you called them?
speaker1: how d'you know he's cheating?

speaker1: oh, come on! of course he is. he's a village boy. even when i fed him the wrong answer the little got it right. 
speaker2: you gave him an answer?
speaker1: well, i didn't exactly-
speaker1: nita?

speaker1: it is all bizarrely plausible. 
speaker2: because i am a slum dog, chi- wallah, i am a liar, right?
speaker1: most of you are.
speaker3: shooting at pila street, october 19th...maman hossani....victim pronounced dead at scene. suspects absconded: two males, early teens, one female, early teen.
speaker1: but you: you're not a liar, mister malik, that is for sure. you are too truthful.

speaker1: thank you, constable. all that remains is to work out whether it was manslaughter or murder. ten years, or life. 
speaker2: the commissioner's here, sir.

speaker1: so? have you charged him yet? 
speaker2: i- progress is being made sir.
speaker1: progress? have you charged him?
speaker2: no, sir.

speaker1: and if that isn't enough for you... 
speaker2: that's-?
speaker1: - yes, yes! the boy's a hero with every beggar and thief in the city. we're in danger of looking very stupid, here, inspector.
speaker2: whilst i'm not convinced he actually cheated, i have got- the inspector brandishes the file.
speaker1: - prem kumar himself- a man of great standing and integrity- said the kid was a liar and a cheat. what more do you need?
speaker2: a liar.
speaker2: indeed, sir.
speaker3: he's in for fraud, so you charge him for fraud. fast. or you'll find yourself on traffic duty at the gateway of india.

speaker1: yes, sir. 
speaker2: sir-?
speaker1: not a word, srinivas.

speaker1: what about my whisky, woman? 
speaker1: hey, salim.

speaker1: it is not written.
speaker3: salim!
speaker2: salim, i....can't.
speaker1: you have to. it'll take you two hours if you drive fast. here.
speaker1: for sake, hold on to it.

speaker1: for what i have done, please forgive me.

speaker2: yes.
speaker1: big reader, are you jamal? a lover of literature?

speaker1: the final question, for twenty million rupees: and he's smiling. i guess you know the answer. 
speaker2: would you believe it? i don't.
speaker1: you don't? so, you're going to take the ten million and walk?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: no?
speaker2: i'll play.

speaker1: you just said you don't know the answer. i heard that, right? you do understand that if you get the answer wrong, you lose everything? ten million rupees. a fortune, jamal. 
speaker2: i'd like to phone a friend.
speaker1: we're going to the wire, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to the wire. the final life-line.

speaker1: doesn't look as if your friend is in, jamal. who is it? 
speaker2: my brother's number, but-
speaker1: - the sort of brother who'd go for a walk on the twenty million rupee question?
speaker2: it's the only number i know.

speaker1: hello? 
speaker1: hello? jamal?
speaker2: wow! that's cutting it fine. i'm guessing this isn't your brother. this is-
speaker1: my name is latika.

speaker1: what the bloody-? he pushes the girl off him. gets to his feet. 
speaker1: latika! salim!

speaker1: okay! so, latika, you want to hear the question one more time? and let's be clear about this. twenty million rupees ride on your answer. you have thirty seconds. jamal, please read out the question to latika.

speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: oh...
speaker2: i've never known.

speaker2: this is our destiny.
