speaker2: arright, let lim go. cite him for rolling the stop ... and cite old atley for driving to endanger ...
speaker1: what are you talking about, rollie? we're springing 'em? just like that?
speaker2: just like that. quit your bellyaching, hawkings ... and let's wrap this up ...

speaker1: you know what you got here? 
speaker2: not really -
speaker1: there's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... you know what you gotta do -- ?
speaker2: not really --
speaker1: you have any other answers besides "not really"?
speaker2: not --
speaker1: right. you want to test the voltage drop ... use the voltmeter ... remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... see what you got ... you understand -- ?
speaker3: just can't find good help these days --
speaker1: those things'll kill ya, budgy --
speaker3: they won't have a chance. the bourbon and bacon'll get me first...
speaker1: 1980 mercury cougar. 255 cubic inch v8 ... based on the ford thunderbird bodyshell; they modified the chassis, but didn't improve its performance...
speaker3: damn, you're good memphis nods ... sips his root beer ... budgy you got to bingo last night?
speaker1: that i did, budgy. that i did --
speaker2: uh ... randall -- ?

speaker2: pop the trunk. i need my tool ...
speaker3: what tool -- ?

speaker1: newsflash, kip: you're driving a stolen car kip smiles over the ascending speedometer -- 
speaker2: yeah. ain't it great -- ?

speaker2: they'll be here. you nervous, bro? you? back in the day, they say you had anti-freeze in them veins ... what happened -- ?

speaker1: stolen car, kip. stolen car, stolen car, stolen car ... 
speaker2: stolen fast car...
speaker1: no way, man --

speaker1: something wrong, tumbler -- ? 
speaker2: yeah. i'm missing springer --
speaker1: she'll go 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds --
speaker3: i can vouch for that.

speaker4: no problem -
speaker5: let's get outta here -- !
speaker1: now you gone and done it, raines and they flee ...

speaker1: what's going on -- ? 
speaker2: well, well, well ... and he begins to sing... atley jackson da-doo-doo-doo-da-doo-doo-doo, etc. are you kidding me, man -- ?
speaker1: hello, atley ... atley jackson l.n. orr. i get it. clever ...
speaker1: how's the leg?
speaker2: only hurts when i breathe. lookit you. where are barney fife and aunt bea hanging out? and opie ... where's opie at?
speaker1: what are you doing here?
speaker2: is there someplace we can talk?
speaker1: what about?
speaker2: about your brother. and the deeeep he's in --

speaker1: there you go -- 
speaker2: thanks, donna --
speaker3: it's been a long time, memphis --
speaker2: six years ...
speaker3: six years. time flies, don't it? six years ago we were fartin' through armani and pissin' cristal.
speaker2: tell me about kip - atley takes a sip of his beer,...
speaker3: he took a job. and he fumbled it.
speaker2: what kind of job... ?
speaker3: a boost. a big boost ...
speaker2: a boost? what's kip doing on a boost?
speaker3: you're shittin', right? clearly memphis is not ... atley jackson kip's become quite the little crewrunner since you left. he's been working a low-rent ring for two years now. you don't talk to your ma?
speaker2: it seems she neglected to mention it
speaker3: maybe she don't know. although i don't see how that could be. maybe she didn't want to upset you -
speaker2: don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, atley...
speaker3: the point is: kip's been living the life. only he's a wild child. crazy. makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. but he fungold this one so bad, folks around l.b. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
speaker2: who was the job for?
speaker3: who do you think?

speaker1: can i get some more coffee -- ? 
speaker2: sure, hon ...
speaker3: who's a guy gotta know to get a tuna melt in this joint -- ?
speaker4: what's the word, memphis -- ?
speaker3: how ya doing, ruby -- ?
speaker2: come, come, come ...
speaker3: right ...
speaker2: you look good...
speaker3: you, too, ma...
speaker2: what are you doing back?
speaker3: how's kip?
speaker2: have you seen him?
speaker3: no.
speaker2: oh.
speaker3: atley jackson came to see me ...
speaker2: atley jackson. how is that one? how's the leg... ?
speaker3: why didn't you tell me?
speaker2: i couldn't. i didn't want you to worry. i thought held sort himself out. i hardly see him. he comes and goes. he's in trouble, isn't he?
speaker3: he's in some trouble ...
speaker2: i knew it. he's changed, randall. he's a different boy. he's lost that... that sweetness ... it's gone ... and i don't know what to do ...
speaker3: you getting my checks ... ?
speaker2: of course ...
speaker5: detective castlebeck... it's me ... yeah... you ain't never gonna guess who just come in to visit his ma --
speaker3: he doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
speaker2: kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. i don't know what you remember of him. but you should brace yourself

speaker1: ... so ... it's my new move ... it's called "the stranger." what i do is, i sit on my hand for 10 minutes. till it falls asleep. till it's good and numb. no feeling. and then i jerk off. 
speaker2: that's disgusting -
speaker3: what's the point, man -- ?
speaker1: cos it's like you're bein' done by a stranger ... it rocks ... it's the power move of the new millennium...
speaker4: hey, kip, what's up?
speaker5: what do you say, toby?,
speaker4: i'm cool -
speaker1: what do you want, shithead?
speaker4: why you gotta front me like that? i'm talking to kip --
speaker1: why don't you leave him alone?
speaker4: i known kip longing than you, man ...
speaker1: oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
speaker3: any word, kip -- ?
speaker5: no ... and they won't take my calls ...
speaker3: what does that mean -- ?
speaker5: it ain't what you'd call a "good sign" he groks their fear... kip look - we managed to get 13 in a week.
speaker3: but we only got till friday. that's four days. and we lost the 13. so's we gotta start over ...
speaker5: that, too ... don't sweat it, freb. we're cool. angle the front door. for memphis has entered. he clocks the room. sees them at the rear ... walks back
speaker5: it can be done, man. we just gotta step it up... it's a challenge ...
speaker6: the challenge is not to get our nuts cut-off and shoved down our throats ...
speaker1: can i help you, pal -- ? and kip looks up ... to see memphis there ...
speaker7: hey, kip ...
speaker5: hello, memphis --
speaker1: "memphis?" you're memphis?
speaker7: that's right...
speaker1: damn, damn, ...
speaker3: memphis. holy it's an honor, man --
speaker5: it's good to see ya, man. you changed your look -
speaker7: you, too hold the stare... the others are excited...
speaker3: what are you doing back, memphis?
speaker7: little visit. check on the family.
speaker5: it's nice to see ya, man -
speaker4: hey, memphis. remember me? toby walker. i live next door ...
speaker7: sure. hey, toby. you grew up
speaker4: yeah, i'm cool ...
speaker5: who's got next game -- ?
speaker6: i get it. you ain't gotta be a genius: memphis come back to save our bacon!
speaker1: shut-up, mirror man --
speaker3: izzat true? you come back to save our bacon?
speaker6: of course it's true. he come to save his brother's dangling --
speaker5: that can't be it. cos we don't need saving
speaker3: we don't -- ?
speaker7: he give you an advance -- ?
speaker6: hell, yeah. ten larger man
speaker7: you just give 'im back the money. all's well...
speaker5: "give lim back the money." "give 'im back the money..." be nice. if only we didn't drink the money. and smoke the money. and buy nikes with the money. and sony play stations with the money. and dirty girls with the money...
speaker5: but don't worry, man. things are all sweetness and light here...
speaker1: things are all leafy and suburban ...
speaker6: the they are --
speaker5: sure they are. although we do appreciate the gesture, memphis. but we do got it handled... and it was nice to see you -- -
speaker7: you listen to me, baby brother. you fancy yourself some reat neat tough guy scumbum, well, woop-tee-doo, little puppy with a poundcake. but i remember the days when you used to steal my colorforms and eat 'em... so you can't stop me from saving your "dangling ass' if that's what i feel like doing...
speaker1: homeboy's on the dazzle ...

speaker1: yeah -- ? 
speaker2: randall raines to see mr. calitri ...

speaker1: how ya doing? 
speaker2: good to see you, memphis --
speaker3: so. what do we owe the honor -- ?
speaker1: it's about my brother ... kip...
speaker3: yes ... kip ...
speaker3: excuse me one moment, randall ...

speaker1: you bring this to me in this condition? blood and guts all over it? you make me complicit? on my property? who taught you how to think? and worst of all: weren't there supposed to be two hondas? 
speaker2: please ...
speaker1: stupid sonuvabitch...

speaker1: car-jacker. neglected to clean up after himself ... 
speaker2: ...
speaker1: the business has changed...
speaker3: now. where were we? oh, yes. kip.
speaker2: i don't want him hurt...
speaker3: i'm proud of this work. the bird feeder. the wagon wheel planter. the dollhouse. the drop-leaf movable server...
speaker2: i'm sure you're working your way to the point. i'll wait right here ...
speaker3: my point. yes. simple, really. i require the best. i insist on the best. i only engage the best. your brother. his friends. they came to me. they wanted my paper. he was your brother. you were the best. now. they've brought so much heat down, i may not be able to fill this order. which would be very bad for me. which in turn, is very bad for them...
speaker2: i could kill you. that occurred to me. when i first heard about this. that i would kill you ...
speaker3: grow up. you don't kill people like me. people like me die in their sleep at 87 ... do you know why? because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over california ...
speaker2: i can come up with the front money.
speaker3: were it only that easy. i have
speaker2: they gave you only four days?
speaker3: they gave me two weeks. i wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ... memphis scans the list ... calitri four days. 50 cars. i'm paying 200 thousand dollars ... now memphis looks up...
speaker2: i'm not interested --
speaker3: i knew you'd say that.
speaker2: i'm just here about my brother.
speaker3: i knew you'd say that, too --
speaker2: sound it out for me.
speaker3: your brother has four days. fifty cars. five-zero. for that he gets 200 large ...
speaker2: and if he doesn't make it -- ?
speaker3: i made this, too. my first one. brass extension handles, not plated. the coverings are silk, not rayon. expensive hardwood. and lined with spray green lorraine crepe ... memphis waits, knowing where this is going -- calitri yes, yes. i made it for young kip. in case he fails. at 8:00 friday morning, if that ship sets off without my fifty ... kip will take up permanent residence in this box ...
speaker4: evenin', mr. c. --
speaker3: digger, butz: let me introduce you to randall raines. used to head up the dandiest ring in southern cal. left us for parts unknown. randall, this is digger. and that's butz -
speaker4: hi, randall --
speaker3: digger and butz will be in charge of burial. they're good boys ... memphis' look is cold and furious ... plaintive:
speaker2: i don't want them hurt. any of 'em...
speaker3: "don't want" the dodgers to lose or the summer to end. but we don't get to choose these things...

speaker1: i know you. 
speaker2: you know my back.
speaker3: when'd you get to town, raines?
speaker2: the other day....
speaker3: what for?
speaker2: no particular reason. catch a laker game. i heard we got shaquille ...
speaker3: where you been, anyway?
speaker2: just out there. roaming around. building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
speaker3: you seem a little hinked-up ...
speaker2: not at all ...
speaker1: i remember us having made some kind of deal, randall. i don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. i look at you - here - in my town - and i'm confused...
speaker2: a little family emergency --
speaker1: i hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
speaker2: no...
speaker1: or your baby brother. what was his name?
speaker2: kip.
speaker1: yes, kip. short for kipling. named for the english writer of stories about india ... he bites into his pear ... memphis says nothing, waits ... detective castlebeck i got a rash of thefts. a new crew is making noise. we recovered a big take - last week...
speaker2: and this has what to do with me?
speaker1: i don't know. but you shouldn't be here. take care of your business. i'll give you 24 hours. and then i don't want to see your face. ever again. make a fool of me once, that's my bad. make a fool of me twice. that's really my bad, and i'll kick your from here to india ...
speaker1: good. cos you know how it plays. six years ago, i let you go free. but the next time ... the next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
speaker3: by the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. we'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
speaker4: you goin' home?
speaker5: yeah... you want a ride...
speaker4: sure -
speaker5: how'd you get here? your moms give you ride -- ?
speaker4: hell, no. i boosted a 'vette.
speaker5: you boosted a 'vette? then where is it?
speaker4: i dunno. it was right here. someone musta' boosted it back...
speaker5: crooks is everywhere -- they smile...and go to kip's trans am... toby memphis seemed weird, huh? what's with them clothes? he a farmer now or something?
speaker5: yeah. except the only thing he's growing is old...
speaker5: don't you do that! you leave him alone!
speaker6: shaddup, raines
speaker5: he's got nothing to do with this --
speaker6: get him in the car

speaker1: hello, kip -- 
speaker2: lemme out of this --
speaker1: were it only that easy --
speaker2: we can still do it --
speaker1: no you can't. flies on sherbert is what you remind me of. because just being attracted to something, doesn't mean you belong...

speaker1: listen, calitri -- 
speaker2: call me "ray." better yet: call me "asshole." cos that's how you've treated me --
speaker1: i get out of this i'm gonna you up --

speaker1: kip -- ? 
speaker2: yeah ...
speaker1: you all right -- ?
speaker2: i think so. there's things i can't feel right now. like my feet. but ... you think you can get me outta this, memphis? i'd appreciate it -
speaker1: just hold-on there --
speaker2: this has nothing to do with any of that --
speaker1: oh. you maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
speaker2: all my enemies own car crushers. it's like a pre-requisite ... owwww...
speaker1: easy ... take it easy ... we're almost there...

speaker1: you okay -- ? 
speaker2: totally. i'm fine. you want a beer, man -- ?
speaker1: sure --
speaker2: you like kobe's game? i do. you think he's heir apparent to mj? i do. he speaks fluent italian, you know? so he's got that going for him --
speaker1: you sure you're okay -- ?
speaker2: yeah, man. where is your beer?
speaker2: cool. so you're living up north?
speaker1: yeah -
speaker2: i heard you were pumping gas -
speaker1: something like that -
speaker2: you're kind of cultivating a new look.
speaker1: yeah --
speaker2: nah. it's a scratch.
speaker1: okay -- beat ...
speaker2: hey, you want something to eat ?
speaker1: what do you got ... ?
speaker2: not much. i got olives. you like olives? kalamata olives rule, i think. ma likes the calabrese. it's more mellow and he brings over a bowl of olives.
speaker1: there's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
speaker2: yeah, yeah. that's what i'm thinking --
speaker1: so what are you gonna do?
speaker2: about what?
speaker1: "about what?"
speaker2: about calitri? no worries, man. i'll call him. he's a reasonable dude ...
speaker1: i can see that -
speaker2: yeah. he just wants to know i'm still on it. he needs reassurance. all these big swinging do. no worries. i won't let him get into our kool-aid...
speaker1: what happened to you?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: you just got crushed in a car. you're bleeding all over your self. and you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
speaker2: c'mon, man... my "demise..." overreaction
speaker1: "over--" you know - i can maybe understand, since i been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that i can partly blame myself. but what is baffling to me, is how, since i been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
speaker2: hey, now -
speaker1: he's gonna kill you -- !
speaker2: i can handle it --
speaker1: you can handle it?
speaker2: i can handle it --
speaker1: you can handle it?
speaker2: i can handle it --
speaker1: you?
speaker2: me.
speaker1: you?
speaker2: me...
speaker1: you don't think so, huh?
speaker2: not really ... but you know... maybe i'm wrong ...

speaker1: nicolo, how's the yellowtail today? 
speaker2: very nice, atley. very nice ...
speaker1: you can't get it any fresher than this, memphis ... from the sea to my skillet ... nothing in between...
speaker3: what's with the fish thing -- ?
speaker1: we can learn something from our asian friends. they smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
speaker3: fish.
speaker1: and they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. you know why? all they eat is seafood.
speaker3: also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "karaoke."
speaker1: i do a poaching number. six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. in 8 minutes, i could cater a wedding. plain but flavorful. and it's a good way to show off my hollandaise sauce ...
speaker3: you have a hollandaise sauce ?
speaker1: i do ... christ, what happened to us ?
speaker3: speak for yourself, boss i don't have a hollandaise sauce
speaker1: no, but you dress like an ...
speaker3: i think about that night a lot...
speaker1: me, too. every time i walk...
speaker3: how they were just there ... waiting on us ... the fix was definitely in ...
speaker1: yeah -- ?
speaker3: yeah tell him to lay off kip and them tell him it's on atley nods...
speaker1: any idea how you're gonna go at it?

speaker1: hello, otto ... 
speaker2: you remember junie?
speaker1: of course. hi, junie --
speaker3: hello, memphis -
speaker1: what happened here -- ?
speaker2: whatever do you mean?
speaker1: the chop-shop... where are the stripped cars? the rolled-back odometers? the part bins?
speaker2: what happened? old-age happened. i tired of killing them. i woke up one morning and thought i am no longer a destroyer. i am a means of resurrection. now. we restore. we revive. there are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. most must die. these don't have to...
speaker1: you, too, otto
speaker2: i heard rumors you were back. about kip ...
speaker1: he's gotten involved -- otto looks up frustrated... to junie
speaker2: i can't concentrate. play something, my sweetness; my reason to rise ...
speaker1: you think it can be done?
speaker2: are you considering a comeback tour?
speaker1: tell me...
speaker2: it can be done. take two days to shop; one to prep. i'll offer up my bible for a small fee. you also have to hope kip's jerk-circus didn't undo castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. and then get yourself a crew...
speaker1: the hard part ...
speaker2: "a people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - yes, and then to get around them..." nietzsche said that.
speaker1: is he still working here ?
speaker2: the old crew. go find them. i can't help you with that. since i've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... a pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
speaker1: i just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
speaker2: i remember i had a 1964 buick opal. worst car ever built. value job. everything broke and i-fixed it. a coma car - built to german specs. plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. on a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. but when that car was gone, i missed it. if it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
speaker1: and the moral of that story is -- ?
speaker2: go to them. they'll be happy to see you ... ahhh...

speaker1: pull over! pull her the over! 
speaker2: i'm sorry.
speaker1: you ain't sorry. you're a horrible driver... you can't strap into your seat belt, without almost getting creamed by a bus ... she starts to cry... donny softens ... donny astricky aw, c'mon. it's no big deal. you can't drive. you can't. time to acknowledge it and move on. i can't swim. i know i can't. so you know what i do? i stay the outta the pool ...

speaker1: memphis raines. long time ... 
speaker2: how you doing, man?
speaker1: all i get are the orientals. they can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em so? what are you doing here?
speaker2: you know where the others are?
speaker1: most of 'em are gone. the dyar boys are doing a nickel at chino; henry santoro and frankie fish are moving weight in florida; bill doolin was killed in denver... atley jackson's on the gimp and runnin' errands for calitri; the sphinx is still around, i guess ... then of course, there's ...
speaker2: forget that ...
speaker1: okay. figure it forgotten. what's this about anyways -- ?

speaker1: most of 'em are late-model... 
speaker2: that's right. only 10 exotics ...
speaker1: we'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
speaker3: some crew you got ...
speaker2: if we put out the word. that we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job...
speaker1: a bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. this ain't like the old days, memphis. the profession has lost its..
speaker3: dignity...
speaker1: yeah...
speaker2: well, the three of us don't'exactly inspire confidence...
speaker1: wow! they got eleanor here -- ?
speaker2: i know. weird, huh -- ?
speaker4: otto, there's someone here to --
speaker1: lookit kip. all grown up...
speaker5: hey, donny --
speaker2: what are you doing here?
speaker5: otto called - memphis looks to otto ... otto shrugs ...
speaker3: you need him...
speaker2: no we don't -
speaker3: i appreciate your dilemma, memphis. but how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
speaker2: his criminal career has officially come to a close ...
speaker3: the conundrum still applies, of course. the purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. however. this cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be. memphis considers ... he has little choice ...
speaker2: we do this. then. you're finished.
speaker5: i like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all clifford huxtable on my ...
speaker2: you hear me?
speaker5: i hear ya. get me outta this. i'll move to the country. open a fruit stand...
speaker1: you guys have any skills at all?
speaker5: hell, yeah. mirror man here is our electronics expert. he's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
speaker2: how old are you now, toby?
speaker6: sixteen. but my birthday's in seven months ...
speaker1: what about him?
speaker5: freb can order pizzas like nobody's business freb starts to protest ... shrugs ...
speaker7: people gotta eat ...
speaker2: okay, then... otto?
speaker3: in order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. put all your nuts in one basket.
speaker8: one night? are you nuts?
speaker2: you got maybe a better plan?
speaker5: you spread it out ... you move around... so's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... shadow games and

speaker1: "shadow games?" 
speaker2: shadow games ...
speaker1: you spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. know something's up. with a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail. kip and the others nod... makes sense ... memphis go on, otto -
speaker3: we're on a truncated time-table. take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... and we're still going to need to expand the crew...
speaker4: there's no one left ...
speaker3: we've got several italian cars on the list. always tricky, always timeconsuming. so we're gonna need a specialist ...
speaker5: you know of one -- ?
speaker1: yeah. he's knows of one all right.

speaker1: one more, girl - 
speaker2: i think you've had enough, billy...
speaker1: enough? i haven't even started, girl.
speaker2: if you leave now, billy, you can get a head-start on waking up in a pool of your own vomit...
speaker1: listen, you little cooze--

speaker1: come back when you've learned how to drink, billy -- 
speaker2: see you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
speaker1: what are you doing here?
speaker1: what's with the look?
speaker2: the hip, cool, thing was getting old...
speaker1: you look like you lost your sheep ...
speaker2: you still wrenching at bacchiochi's?
speaker1: hell, yeah. i'm not getting rich in here ...
speaker2: buy you a drink?
speaker1: nope. i got a coffee. and a boyfriend.
speaker2: "mitch?"
speaker1: mitch.
speaker2: so i was replaced by mitch?
speaker1: no. you were replaced by alex. who was replaced by kevin. who was replaced by vince. who was replaced by mitch...
speaker2: wow. and to think all i accomplished these past six years was the "lord of the rings" trilogy...
speaker1: yeah, well, you always were a sucker for flawed existences ... angle - mitch. watching them talk ... sway you should leave --
speaker2: on account of mitch?
speaker1: on account of me.
speaker2: i've taken the spear for a lot of people, sway. including you. can't we improvise a little here ... ?
speaker1: no can do. life goes on, pointfive ...
speaker2: i left town. i didn't leave you.
speaker1: a distinction worth noting ...
speaker2: and here i am...
speaker1: yes. but i got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
speaker2: kip's in trouble and now she looks concerned
speaker1: what kind of trouble -- ?
speaker2: kip took a job. fifty ladies in two weeks. only the two weeks have turned into four days. and not a single lady has been snared.
speaker1: and you got some italians -- ?
speaker2: six or seven...
speaker1: i'm not doing it anymore. haven't for a while. i've carved out something for myself. it's pathetic, but it's mine ...
speaker2: i understand -
speaker3: another round, sara -
speaker1: sure, mitch -
speaker3: how you doing, pal?
speaker2: i'd go so far as to say "lovely."
speaker3: you should her face when she's having -- and memphis turns to him...
speaker2: really?
speaker3: really...
speaker2: what's it look like?
speaker1: what the are you doing -- ?
speaker2: if you change your mind. we're at otto's. it's 50 ladies in 24 hours. for the carpenter. 200 k and kip's life on the felt. so long now ...
speaker3: who was that guy, sara?
speaker1: good question ...

speaker1: freb's here. open the gate. 
speaker2: we sent him out on a solo boost. see what he could do ...
speaker3: how do i look in this one?
speaker4: like a goofy white boy in a cadillac.
speaker2: how'd it go?
speaker3: keys were in it ...
speaker2: well, that defies the point, don't it?
speaker4: you should ask him how he got the name "freb."
speaker3: shaddup, man ...
speaker2: get the thing in there and get it cleaned up -
speaker5: this is loaded with - get a duffel.
speaker2: lemme see that - he pierces the skin.. tastes ... donny astricky heroin.
speaker5: no
speaker2: there's gotta be a million bucks worth here -
speaker1: we're rich. goddamn, we're rich!
speaker6: where'd you pick her up?
speaker3: in front of one of them poker parlors in chinatown ...
speaker6: well, take it back --
speaker5: take it back? what do you mean take it back? are you crazy, man?
speaker6: take it back, freb --
speaker4: hey, now, memphis... c'mon, man -
speaker7: who is it -- ?
speaker8: castlebeck.
speaker2: the whole thing's loaded.
speaker7: one minute -- !
speaker8: i know you.
speaker6: you know my back.
speaker8: what are you still doing here, randall?
speaker6: stopped by to see otto. say hello.
speaker8: what's this -- ?
speaker7: cadillac.
speaker8: what's wrong with it -- ?
speaker7: needs brightening ...
speaker8: run me down a tag - 329 hro. cadillac.
speaker7: no faith in our new-found goodness, detective ...?
speaker8: sure. but sometimes we got to create some numbers. the task force is run by statistics, you know ...
speaker9: 329 hro. there's no want on the license at this time...
speaker6: you're thinking: okay, there's no want ... but they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
speaker8: something like that -
speaker6: let her rip ... and castlebeck starts the car...
speaker8: okay, then. i'll catch you later, randall ...
speaker7: double-meaning intended, right?
speaker8: right ...
speaker8: it's funny. there's probably been five more cars stolen in the time i've been here ...
speaker6: i don't think so, detective ...

speaker1: hey - he kisses her head ... memphis kip - kip nods ... plays on ... memphis what do you got there? 
speaker2: the photo album. i get nostalgic around this time of year ...
speaker1: what time of year?
speaker2: tuesdays ...
speaker1: you ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
speaker2: every day. i wonder about that every day...
speaker1: kip and i'd probably be working at the dealership... imagine us selling cars?
speaker2: and just in case you lose your keys, good sir, i can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
speaker1: mother -- !
speaker2: i remember. supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
speaker1: you remember that, kip?
speaker3: i was six ...
speaker1: after he died ... i think that's what i missed most of all ... that there was no different cars every night ... when i started hanging around otto's ... and he started showing me the things ... it was a way to kill two birds ... put food on the table for you and kip ... and ... ride in different cars every night ... just like when dad was here.
speaker3: ancient history's two things. "ancient." and "history!"
speaker2: i know...
speaker1: we do it. he'll get clear once and for all and she nods ...

speaker1: car-jacking is the lazy man's boost. no skill. no finesse. can only take the car if the key is in it. that's not thieving. that's parking ... 
speaker2: they're just cars, man ...
speaker3: this eleanor's been living at the international towers for 3 years now.
speaker2: who's "eleanor?"
speaker3: the 167 mustang shelby mustang gt-500.
speaker2: why do you call it "eleanor?"
speaker3: all the vehicles get code names. female names. you say "eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
speaker1: eleanor is memphis' "unicorn."
speaker3: and there she is --
speaker2: it looks just like a regular mustang --
speaker4: don't go there, toby --
speaker3: she's not. carroll shelby tweaked the mustang's high-performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... but its actual output is closer to 600 ...
speaker2: so she flies -
speaker3: she soars -
speaker1: grade-a unicorn ...
speaker2: what's a "unicorn?"
speaker1: fabled creature. you know - the horse with the horn? impossible to capture? toby looks blank ... donny astricky we all got one. the single car that, no matter how many times you try to boost, something happens... cops show up, car doesn't start, owner comes back. it's voodoo...
speaker2: you guys and the car thing, man --
speaker3: see you in a few days, eleanor --

speaker1: and you just stick it in the lock. hit this little button ... and ... 
speaker2: we're dinosaurs, donny. pull-up a tar pit ... can i try -- ?
speaker1: knock yourself out --
speaker3: i logged outside the g.r.a.b. site, right? then i monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? then i got these isdn numbers, right? then i tracked them back, right? then i took the one i could jack-up the easiest, right? then i called back see, they think i'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like i'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? so now they're sharing it with me, right? they think i'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. so they let me in, right? give me all these numbers. but then i don't leave, right? i'm in. i've got the key. now i just go anywhere i want.
speaker4: so what's in there -- ?
speaker3: i can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. i can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. i can tell you how they used to spend that annoying
speaker5: good work, toby --
speaker6: it just ain't happening --
speaker7: you'll get the hang of it, kid. you just need to remember one thing -
speaker6: what's that?
speaker7: on boost night? always take along a good mix tape ... donny smiles ... freb frowns ... donny astricky you bring a woman back to your crib for some lovemaking, the song you put on, depends on the woman, the type of you intend to do, right?
speaker6: i guess ...
speaker7: you got a school teacher or nancy from accounting, you don't put on sly stone or james brown. you put on ravel. rachmaninoff. but if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on cat stevens or james taylor. you'd put on prince. or isaac hayes. or, if you really wanted to get after it: miles.
speaker6: okay ...
speaker7: it's the same way with cars. different cars. different tunes. you can't steal a maserati listening to sinatra. you gotta get urgent. you gotta get sonny rollins or led zeppelin iv, on that but never, never-ever take no allman brothers into a lincoln town car. could lead to disaster. got it... ?
speaker6: got it ...
speaker7: good.
speaker8: janis joplin. billie holliday. ella fitzgerald...
speaker7: gender bias ...
speaker2: i've missed you, sara wayland --
speaker8: good to see ya, otto --
speaker5: how ya doing, sway -- ?
speaker8: kip...
speaker7: what do you think about all this?
speaker8: stick it in the drawer marked "fool's errand", right -- ?
speaker7: that's my girl --
speaker4: that's mirror man ... and that's freb ... and tumbler ... and toby ... fellas, this is sara wayland... they call her "sway."
speaker8: hey -
speaker4: of course ...
speaker8: good. just so we understand...
speaker9: and the others really don't dig his scene ...
speaker7: well, well, well. the original crash test dummy...
speaker6: who's that -- ?
speaker2: that's the sphinx.
speaker6: the sphinx?
speaker2: he never says a word. and he's got a messed-up nose. hence. the sphinx. he's boo-koo koo-koo. but he steals like time ... hello, sphinxy, old rum -- !
speaker4: okay. we're all here. today's wednesday. d-day is friday night ... that gives us two days to prep ... we're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... let's get into the vans --
speaker1: where we going -- ?
speaker4: we're going shopping -- !

speaker1: how's it going -- ? 
speaker2: it's arright ... they drive on ... till -- donny astricky check it out: 173 firebird. know who drove one of those ... ?
speaker3: yes, i do, in fact. john wayne in mco...
speaker2: that's being obscurest ... who else?
speaker1: jim rockford. rockford files.
speaker4: for real?
speaker2: for real. okay. gimme columbo...
speaker5: peugot convertible ...
speaker2: what color?
speaker5: gray.
speaker6: how you know that?
speaker5: remember who my brother is?

speaker1: that cracker -- 
speaker2: i know that one. general lee, i believe, was a ... dodge charger ...
speaker3: you ever notice how it had a different interior every week? that bugged me.
speaker1: three words: get a life.

speaker1: i'd like the names and addresses of the owners of these 20 cars please... 
speaker2: it'll take me about 15 minutes.
speaker1: i can wait.

speaker1: okay, okay. what about magnum p.i.? 
speaker2: thanks for playing, freb. that's a gimme ...
speaker3: yes, but what was on the license plate?
speaker4: the license plate?
speaker5: i know. "robin 1."
speaker3: very good. but what was the significance of "robin 1"?
speaker1: was that his first name?
speaker3: his first name was thomas. thomas magnum...
speaker6: thomas sullivan magnum, to be exact.
speaker5: robin 1 ...
speaker4: i know! robin was the name of that faggy guy who hung with him...
speaker2: no. that was higgins ....
speaker6: jonathan quayle higgins ...
speaker4: you're like a serial killer, ainchoo?

speaker1: it's two dollars per car. that'll be 40 dollars please... 
speaker2: anyone? the significance of "robin 1" on magnum's license plate? memphis?
speaker3: robin was robin masters. he owned the estate they lived on ...
speaker2: ten points for our fearless leader ... sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the bill bixby trifecta -- ?
speaker4: i don't know that
speaker5: stumped -- !
speaker6: thank-god, sway, you ain't all freaky- deaky, too but sway grins
speaker4: how about: a corvette in magician; a ford pick-up truck in incredizle hulk, and...
speaker2: here's where it gets tricky ...
speaker4: ... he walked in the courtship of
speaker7: kip high-fives her... freb looks disappointed...
speaker8: walked like a bastard... skippin' stones and shit..
speaker2: that's a good one, donny...
speaker8: i think so too --
speaker9: ya'll really need to get the out of the house more...

speaker1: hello -- ? 
speaker2: hey.
speaker1: what's wrong with her -- ?
speaker2: the right side of the engine is running richer than the left. and the scope isn't showing i dunno... and she goes to the sink... sway you know annie's trouble
speaker1: annie -- ?
speaker2: you haven't been studying --
speaker1: right. great car. one of a kind. i was looking forward to that boost myself
speaker2: she was the only "annie" you could find?
speaker1: they only made a handful. we're lucky there's even one living in the area...
speaker2: yeah, well ... she lives with district court judge seymour croft ...
speaker2: ... and he keeps "annie' in his living room... like a work of art ...

speaker1: she's got 27 miles on her o-dom. which is exactly how far away the custom shop was in 1979 when he bought her... he drove her home, never drove her again ... 
speaker1: the man's a freak...
speaker1: she's trouble --
speaker2: i put the boys on it. they're clever that way...
speaker1: i go with you --
speaker2: that what you want?
speaker1: that's what i want ...
speaker2: okay.
speaker1: you mentioned that in your letters
speaker2: i always thought you'd follow me up.
speaker1: we were good when you bailed, weren't we?
speaker2: very good...
speaker1: cos there were those dark days, when i figured - my how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ...
speaker2: no way ...
speaker1: no ... ?
speaker2: no ...
speaker1: don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, randall. i'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. so save the sanctimonious for someone who believes. the only reason i ride with you, is cause i don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
speaker2: oh. okay. right.

speaker1: i'm on the move - 
speaker2: your girl works in there ...
speaker1: not my girl anymore
speaker2: yet your still here ... i gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
speaker1: what do you want from me?
speaker2: honestly? i want to - once every few months - get into my car. pack a lunch. and drive on up to chino. on visiting day. bring you some magazines. maybe some almond clusters. and see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. that's what i want ...

speaker1: this one ... 
speaker2: reads the infrared. then kills it. little
speaker1: how long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
speaker2: after a while, it became a little pathetic ... figured i'd put you out of your misery ...
speaker1: thank-you ...
speaker2: de nada ...
speaker1: ain't we good-timing here ... ?
speaker2: the family that steals together, deals together...
speaker1: dad'd be proud --
speaker2: maybe not. but dad was from another era...
speaker1: what era was that -- ?
speaker2: the era when crime didn't pay --
speaker1: as opposed to now, kid car crusher?
speaker2: price of doing business...
speaker1: what about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
speaker2: it's for assholes. the legal buck blows, memphis. you know that. doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"

speaker1: we've got to shake them tomorrow night. i'm making that your problem. that's called delegation of duties. you like it -- ? 
speaker2: sure, man -- and they follow him back into the garage ...

speaker4: there's no talkin' to him --
speaker5: "well, i'm not braggin,' babe so don't put me down but i got the fastest set of wheels in town, etc."

speaker6: hello, otto. my boys at the dock report no cars have yet to be delivered. and there's only one more night ...
speaker7: getting nervous, ray? what happens to you, i wonder, if delivery isn't made? calitri ignores him... looks at kip ...
speaker6: with all the free time i've had not counting cars as they're loaded onto my ship, i've managed to sand the cedar inside your box, kip. this will protect you from the anaerobic bacteria, that normally thrives in an airless; environment. thus prolonging decay ...
speaker1: get out of here, ray --
speaker6: one more night --
speaker1: get out --
speaker6: i hope you know what you're doing. help you if you don't ...

speaker1: i miss orville redenbacher already -- 
speaker2: okay, okay. the important thing to remember, is to think slow. take your time. it may not seem like it, but the night is long. long enough.

speaker1: okay. all our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. let's keep chilly. 
speaker2: you sure i can't go with ya?
speaker1: only use the phones when absolutely necessary... otto's default hq ...

speaker1: what the hell's that -- ?
speaker2: a little trick i picked up at the car thief retirement home ...

speaker1: diane 1. 
speaker2: very good. think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: that's an after-market alarm. can't just cut her wires ...

speaker2: deodorant.
speaker1: wow. bozo, the very clown --
speaker2: so, you seeing anybody?
speaker1: no. i had a girl. she was great. the problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. so i gotta wait another three years before i can even bother to look...
speaker2: she was so great, why'd you leave her?
speaker1: her parole officer strongly recommended it ...

speaker1: what's the matter? 
speaker2: it's all microchips and ...
speaker1: yeah?
speaker2: cool ...

speaker1: so we loaded all of the keyed cars up and dropped 'em ... it was cake ... 8 cars, ba-da-bing ... memphis looks at him in the rear-view ... 
speaker2: having fun, kip?
speaker1: hell, yeah... it's a beautiful business ... i mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it ...

speaker1: just give me another --

speaker2: nah.
speaker1: that's strange. i'm nervous. donny's nervous. everyone's nervous. but not you...
speaker2: i dunno. whatever will be will be...
speaker1: that's a good attitude, kip. for everything but stealing cars ...

speaker1: gina -- ! 
speaker1: say goodbye to your ride, snake...

speaker2: you remember my gramma? yeah. i was thinking. if she were alive. and she asked me. if she came down, right now. asked me. "what do you do, sara? what's your life?" innocently. nonjudgemental. i think it would break her heart if i said i was a thief. i steal cars, gramma. and even though, hey, i learned it all from her son. my uncle eddie. who taught me the basics. which you refined. . i don't think that's what she hoped for me... she looks at him ... sway but ... that said... car thieves are my weakness ... it's all so terribly loretta lynn or something, i know... but ... i don't wanna be a thief anymore ... i don't wanna love a thief anymore ... i want to wear a dress maybe once in a while... maybe have a kid... watch a lot of audrey hepburn movies.. and think about my gramma without also thinking "shame on me. shame on me. shame on me... "

speaker1: arright ... enough ... i can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, you can't help falling off the stool. 
speaker2: shhh... car thieves are your weakness. whispers ... memphis i approach you. it's quiet. i look this way. that. no one around ...
