speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: gayle syrstã¤d gave me a quackers for secret santa last year. i can probably trade with nan, though.
speaker2: cute. brandy would never sit still long enough for me to dress her up like that. tell you that right now.
speaker2: you didn't have to do this whole rigmarole, tim. i told you it's just a little diarrhea.
speaker1: i know. but for you to miss a day of school, millie... i can't remember you ever calling in sick when i had you.
speaker2: well i wasn't going through menopause when you were in middle school now was i?
speaker1: negative. not to my knowledge. not to my knowledge.
speaker1: so. does your tummy feel good enough to...?

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: i can try and... hold it, mil. can you...?
speaker3: bring it home. bring it home.
speaker2: i'm bringing it. bringing it! bringing it! d'aaaarrgho'awesome...

speaker1: ooh, you make me live! you're my best friend! 
speaker2: c'mon tim, i can't hear.
speaker1: sorry. but you are, babygirl.
speaker1: you're my best friend.
speaker2: tss. goofball.
speaker2: y'know galen and dar krause just did a cruise to the bahamas? pretty reasonable they said, price-wise.
speaker1: ya mon, bahama-mama.
speaker2: it's a little different i suppose-- a cruise. but...
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: look, i'm not gonna shilly-shally around here, tim. i found a river cruise through germany-- viking line, real grade-a. it's what i want. for the honeymoon.
speaker1: whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. wait... where's this coming from? we agreed on wisconsin dells for the honeymoon. it's what we agreed on.
speaker2: you've been to the dells two dozen times...
speaker1: so? roger and gwen lemke go to the dells every year...
speaker2: because they have children. water parks are for children...
speaker1: hello, tommy bartlett's ski, sky and stage show? it's not just a water park...
speaker2: timothy, settle. you've never even left the state of wisconsin. barely left brown valley...
speaker1: what's so great about...? you're not... you're missing the... we agreed on the dells.
speaker2: rest her. your mom was my best friend. but it's going on 20 years now. you gotta grow up. you gotta let go. you gotta live a life here.
speaker1: i'm living a perfectly fine life. i don't know why you'd want to...

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: rock the waters or whatever. ridiculous.
speaker2: we agreed on the dells.

speaker1: hello... oh, hey bill... 
speaker1: aw jeez. oh my gosh. no...

speaker1: guy had it all. everything you'd ever want. y'know he flew a cessna? 
speaker2: i always say people like that-- who live fast? they die hard. look at river phoenix.
speaker1: everything you'd ever want.
speaker2: i just don't know. to do those things to yourself. just perverted.
speaker2: who ever heard of such a thing?
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: i'm... gwen, i'm so sorry. roger is-- was-- is-- a personal hero to me. he just... he had it all. if there's... 
speaker1: i'm...

speaker1: you just don't get it, kurt... 
speaker2: aw christ, pammy...
speaker3: hang on guys, how's this sound-- you can both be right. i know you're probably thinking, "oh, an umbrella policy's only for rich people." you know what i say to that? bull roar.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker3: pam, kurt-- i've known you guys since you were little kids. so let's don't think of me as an "insurance salesman." think of me as your friend who just wants to help you protect your dreams...
speaker3: i'm... excuse me a sec...
speaker3: d'you-- can i get you a napkin or something, bill? for that?
speaker5: know how roger used to get down there to cedar rapids? to the asmi convention? any idea?
speaker3: um. i'm with kurt and pam gambsky...
speaker5: flew himself. in a cessna. pilot. it was all worked out. i was going to ease into retirement in july while roger transitioned into his ownership role.
speaker3: wait, roger was going to buy northlands?
speaker5: all worked out. dione already put the down payment on a time share. branson, black hills.
speaker3: holy cow.
speaker6: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker5: yeah, whole deal. now? now i got my back up against christ-knows-what. no lemke, no buyer, the wife's spending like we won the powerball. and what's worse, because of the way, y'know, the way roger passed...
speaker3: the... belt and the lederhosen...?
speaker5: quote-unquote perverted, they're saying. like northlands has some kind of stain. oh, i'm so tired...
speaker3: is there...? can i do anything to help, or...?
speaker3: "innovations in hog farm risk mitigation." roger's two diamond presentation for the asmi convention. i helped prepare it.
speaker5: we need those two diamonds more than ever, tim. if i'm going to sell this company, we need people to feel ok about the northlands brand.
speaker3: mm.
speaker5: i'd go myself but my daughter kayla, the heavy one? she unearthed some polack to marry her. i'm locked into that wedding over in gladstone. no flex. locked in.
speaker7: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker3: whoa-whoa-wait. what are you saying?
speaker5: i'm not asking you to fill roger lemke's shoes. not gonna happen. i'm asking you to deliver his presentation-- to bring me home those two diamonds.
speaker3: i can't go to asmi. to iowa. to cedar rapids, iowa... why can't lila do it?
speaker5: c'mon tim. lila's about as charismatic as a bag of hair.
speaker3: bill, i've never... i mean, i've dabbled in hog farm risk mitigation, but i'm no pro...
speaker5: you were what, 16, when i gave you that filing job? right after your mom passed? raising yourself pretty much, living all alone. and i'm thinking, now here's a kid. here's a kid who's gonna go places. and then, somehow, you kind of just didn't. now, i guess it makes some sense-- a child loses both parents at an early age, becomes what you might call stunted. but cripes almighty, do you want to just sit there in your folks old house, just rot away in brown valley dating that...
speaker5: ... woman the rest of your life?
speaker3: millie and i are getting married.
speaker5: tss, maybe three'll be a charm.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: point is, i'm not exactly dancing in the streets here tim, but it's a perception thing. you go down there to cedar rapids, wholesome and pie- eyed and all that. you show them that northlands is a good outfit-- an upstanding christian outfit...
speaker2: aw cripes, say you'll do it.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: oh, hiya tim.
speaker3: hey. wade. hey. is millie...?
speaker4: hi tim. wade's cable's down.
speaker3: it's six am...?
speaker2: mike and mike in the morning. espn 2.
speaker3: oh yeah. those guys. hilarious. ha.
speaker2: mm.
speaker3: well i just wanted to...
speaker3: oh shoot. you already have a strut the rooster...
speaker4: so this is it then?
speaker4: tim's jetting off to cedar rapids this morning, wade. big deal insurance convention. iowa.
speaker2: that right?
speaker3: it's only four days.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: won't go to germany for our honeymoon, but for work you can just gallivant around like tom petty or one of them?
speaker3: we agreed on the dells... should we maybe talk in the...?
speaker2: oh it don't bother me.
speaker3: if i don't try to do this, it's not just my job, mil. there are four other employees whose lives are on the line. plus carol, who does part time seasonal work. so.
speaker4: it's not for certain a new owner would even keep you guys on.
speaker3: no, bill said he'd make that part of any deal...
speaker4: believe you me, bill krogstad is looking out for one guy. and that's bill krogstad.
speaker2: krogstad.
speaker3: it's... oh, who am i kidding, i'm a little scared here. a lot scared. but not about us. what we've got-- we're like lightning in a bottle, babygirl. i love you so much, mil.
speaker4: i want you to be very careful.
speaker6: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker3: i know. i will. i mean, cedar rapids-- there were only four homicides last year. for a city of 122-thousand that's pretty darn good. the forcible numbers are admittedly a bit higher, but...
speaker4: i want you to check in with me.
speaker3: i will every day. twice a day.
speaker4: make it three times.
speaker3: ok, three times! sheesh. and i'll send a stinkin' telegram, too.

speaker1: airport don't open for two hours. 
speaker2: thanks! just wanna be sure i make my flight. going down to cedar rapids. the big asmi convention?

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: cold enough for you? i'm heading to cedar rapids. supposed to be up in the mid-30s down there. s-weet!
speaker3: any liquids, gels or aerosols must be placed in a quart-size zip-lock. laptop computers must be taken out of the case and placed in...
speaker2: whoa... what's all this now?
speaker3: any liquids, gels or aerosols...
speaker4: tim! praise christ you haven't left yet.
speaker2: hey bill, what's going on?
speaker4: can't believe i forgot to get this to you. hang on, lemme...
speaker4: it's basically an asmi convention bible. it's going to tell you who to talk to, who to avoid, how best to fellowship and network...
speaker2: dean ziegler, stevens point.
speaker4: ziegler is a cancer. called one of lemke's biggest clients-- joyce armbrã¼ster? smeared roger's name and the northlands' name. frickin' poacher. avoid ziegler like the plague. the fella i got you rooming with, ronald wilkes-- that's who you stick by.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: you got the presentation, right?
speaker2: affirmative.
speaker2: on me at all times. plus three back- up discs.
speaker4: hey-hey! that kind of prep is pure lemke! didn't know any better, i'd say roger's spirit had kind of climbed into you, just planted its seed inside you there. atta boy!
speaker2: bill... i have to ask. let's say one of these big dogs-- your allstates, your prudentials-- does decide to go and buy northlands...?
speaker4: said it before, i'll say it again: your job, the office in brown valley-- all safe. what you need to worry about is getting down there and representing us the best you can. that's all you need to worry about.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: just gotta make sure you're willing and able to assist crew members in the event of an emergency evacuation...
speaker3: you're talking what, water landing? terror type deal? terrorists...?
speaker2: it's really just a formality.
speaker3: believe it or not, i have actually never been on an airplane before.
speaker2: oh, well you'll do awesome.
speaker3: ok. if you need any help, i'm in.

speaker1: tim lippe. 
speaker2: ah. david marinakis.
speaker1: great to meet you, dave. wondering, what kind of name is marinakis?
speaker3: greek. it's greek.
speaker1: marinakis. ok. mine's german.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: as in, "don't you get lippy with me, mister." my grandma used to say that. before she passed. lot of people pronounce it lip. course the high german's probably more like lipp-uh.

speaker1: like i say, dave, it's not life insurance so much as it is dream insurance. 
speaker2: it's a good way of looking at it.
speaker1: i think so.
speaker1: let me know how things go with your alltel deal, dave. e-mail me.
speaker2: will do, tim. thanks.

speaker1: hello. score! 
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: holy crap. awesome.

speaker1: hey man, can i a heater? 
speaker2: what's that now?
speaker1: a cigarette?
speaker2: oh, i'm like, "this gal wants to borrow my heater?" tss. but no, sorry, can't help you there.
speaker1: you here for the convention?
speaker2: you bet. tim lippe. northlands insurance. how `bout yourself?
speaker1: ah, bree. i'm bree.
speaker2: well bree, it's nice to meet you.
speaker2: keep smoking and your premiums will go through the roof.
speaker1: thanks mr. surgeon general.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: if you want to party, tim, let me know. i'll be around.
speaker3: you bet. party hearty. nice chatting with you, bree. people are so friendly. tim enters the hotel.

speaker1: checking in with us, sir? 
speaker2: you tell me. never done the hotel deal before.
speaker1: well, welcome. i'll just need to see a credit card for the incidentals...
speaker2: trent, i was given the impression that you honored traveler's checks.
speaker1: yes, we just need an imprint of your card. for the incidentals.
speaker2: traveler's check is a fully insured method of, y'know. 100 percent.
speaker1: i'm aware of that, sir. we won't charge the card unless you rent a movie or take something from the mini-bar...
speaker2: i'm a non-drinker.
speaker1: it's standard, sir.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: have you seen the pool yet? 
speaker2: not yet, but i can smell it. the chlorine. it's a super top-notch place, mil. you'd be blown away. oop, 321. i'm at mi casa. just a... lemme see how this deal works.
speaker2: key's like a stinkin' credit card.
speaker1: what? what happened?
speaker2: oh jeez. i'm sorry. i'm... please. there's an afro-american gentleman in this room.
speaker1: well get the heck outta there!
speaker1: tim! run like hell, tim!
speaker3: are you tim? tim lippe?
speaker3: i'm ronald wilkes. bill krogstad said we were gonna be roommates?
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: tim! tim! tiiim!
speaker2: let me call you back, mil.
speaker5: you are tim...?
speaker2: um. yeah. yes. you bet. for a minute there i was like, whoa, i'm gonna be robbed here, or...
speaker2: it's super... just super great to meet you, ronald.
speaker5: ok. you want to check out the room then?

speaker1: check out these digs. huzzah! 
speaker2: yeah, you could do a lot worse. look tim, i gotta put the cards on the table here. the reason we got the junior suite upgrade is because the hotel overbooked-- wedding or some such. point being, they were asking folks to take on a third roommate to consolidate space. now to me, being an independent owner, the savings of adding a third guy sounded like a real positive.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: but if you've got any qualms, i hear you l and c, that's loud and clear.
speaker3: no. i'm down. down with that. heck yeah. any idea who we're gonna be chilling with, roommate-wise?
speaker2: no. just hope he doesn't snore.
speaker3: can you imagine? or someone who has terrible gas?! like, pull my finger. brrump! hello, no thanks!
speaker2: this isn't woodstock, tim. it's a regional insurance convention. whoever it is, i'm sure he'll be a straight shooter.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: so far it's just the one billboard north of st. cloud. course the traffic load would get me more eyeballs in the twin cities corridor, but at the end of the day, it's n-t- s. not too shabby.
speaker3: ha. n-t-s. that's hilarious. i'd love to own my own agency...
speaker4: baroo-baroo, let's get this party started you mother-rubbers!
speaker4: ronald wilkes! no way! the ronimal! gimme some love-uh, my soul broth-uh!
speaker2: turn down the volume, ziegler. you just got here, for pete's sake.
speaker4: what's the matter, friend, never seen a chocolate-vanilla love sandwich?! wait until later when we get to the buttfucking! nah, i'm having fun. dean ziegler. stevens point, wisconsin.
speaker4: don't worry, i won't bite. i'm medicated. not really. but i should be. right ronimal? so what's your handle pal?
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: we drew the short straw with this pitiful reprobate, tim. dean, this is tim lippe.
speaker4: call me deanzie. where you hail from, tim lippe? quiet-land?
speaker3: no. i do not. i'm down from brown valley, wisconsin.
speaker3: northlands insurance.
speaker4: bill krogstad's outfit. the krogger! aw i was sorry as to hear about lemke's passing up there. that guy was as a rep. course he thought i was a big, loud asshole-- s'pose he wasn't too far off there. no boy, a real tragedy.
speaker3: uh, thanks. thank you. it's...
speaker4: amen. he'll be in my prayers. his family, too. tragedy.
speaker4: well. i don't know about you wingnuts, but the deanzie could use a drinkzie. what say we blow off the welcome hoo-ha and hit horizons for happy hour. two-for-one cocktails, 10 cent wings, and an all-you-care-to-eat buffet!
speaker2: that line was unappealing last year, dean. it remains so now.
speaker3: i'm planning to watch president helgesson's opening remarks.
speaker6: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: oh, don't get me started on that smug orin helgesson is a-- pardon my french-- a just a steaming wet dog
speaker2: no one's buying the potty-mouth nonsense you're selling, dean. tim, you'll learn to ignore this degenerate before too long. let's go hear what orin has to say.
speaker4: fine. have fun ladies... not.
speaker4: party time. excellent.

speaker1: i'm orin helgesson, your asmi midwest region chapter president. but i'm not going to make you play hail to the chief. not yet anyhow. 
speaker1: seriously, we've got a great line- up for asmi `09, with our forward- looking theme, let's build a bridge to the 22nd century! just so many innovations-- our newsletter, the asmi-teer is now fully digital. so a lot of our breakout sessions will be dealing with this kind of "e- commerce" sort of thing.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: if you didn't pick up your welcome kits, be sure and see mike pyle, the gentleman in the-- what color's that sweater vest mike?
speaker3: beige.
speaker2: in the beige sweater vest. great.
speaker4: i'm worried about this deanzie guy. bill krogstad told me specifically to stay the heck away from him.
speaker5: oh, dean ran for president against orin last year-- only got four votes. he's running again this year. he's just full of bluster.
speaker2: ... the two diamonds are given every year to the agency that best exemplifies the asmi decree: "to provide high quality insurance services and related products while maintaining commitment to community, country and god." we have a record number of entries this year-- over 15 agencies competing. good luck to you all.
speaker4: did he say over 15 agencies?
speaker5: yeah, it's gonna be brutal this year. i brought my a-game though.
speaker4: you're competing?
speaker6: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker5: heck yeah. it's the first year i've ever had a real shot. but the guy you really have to worry about is mike pyle. he owns the sixth largest allstate agency in the upper midwest. the guy's a shark.
speaker2: ... moment of silence for the man many considered to be the michael jordan of mutual insurance agents. roger lemke.
speaker2: were you there when they crucified my lord? were you there when they crucified my lord?

speaker1: i need to talk to you, mil. i'm in over my head here. i feel like i can't even swim. it was fun at first, but now it's like, i dunno. i need you so bad, babygirl... 
speaker2: millie's in the john.
speaker1: who's...? wade?
speaker2: you bet.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: are...? you're at millie's still?
speaker2: badger hockey's on. my cable's out.
speaker2: you want her to give you a ring when she's off the john?
speaker1: um. yes, please. and just, would you tell her i love her very much.
speaker2: you got it, bud.

speaker1: you were checking me out. 
speaker1: i'm gonna have to tell the hotel there's a pervo in the fitness center hitting on innocent women.
speaker2: i... ma'am, no. i'm sorry if you...
speaker1: unbelievable. that poor woman should know what you're up to.
speaker2: no, no, no, please. i didn't...
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: i am so sorry. i'm totally messing with you. i'm a jerk.
speaker2: ha. ok. that was different. ha. yes. yes you are. a real...
speaker1: i'm so sorry. joan ostrowski-fox.
speaker2: tim lippe.
speaker4: don't get lippy with me, mister.
speaker4: so do you play professional basketball, tim? because that's a pretty updated uniform there.
speaker2: no i don't. i'm actually in town for the asmi convention.
speaker4: oh, is that where a bunch of guys sit around a table looking up the word "gullible" in a dictionary?
speaker2: no, it's an association of insur...
speaker4: indeed i am. i'm here for asmi, too. in from oh-my-god, nebraska. just kidding-- omaha. ugh, i am gross, so i'm going to bid you farewell, tim lippe. see you at horizons tonight?
speaker2: um.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: unless you were planning on spying on me in the shower.
speaker4: i am evil. i need help.

speaker1: how ya doin'? 
speaker2: oh. i... ok.
speaker2: i... i really enjoyed your speech, president helgesson.
speaker1: you were in there? marvelous. did you like the part about e-commerce?
speaker2: you bet. very much, sir.
speaker1: terrific. it's the future y'know.
speaker2: tim lippe. down from brown valley, wisconsin. northlands insurance?
speaker1: whew boy. tim, what can i say? i just-- we're all feeling it. i'm so sorry for the loss...
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: um, well, it's rough. real rough. like you said in your remarks, roger wasn't just a great rep, he was a good father and...
speaker1: and a pilot. flew a cessna.
speaker2: yeah. it's just rough.
speaker1: come here, son.
speaker2: thank you.
speaker1: tim, i know bill's looking to retire and from the sound of it he's on the hook for a pretty sweet time share.
speaker2: yeah, it sounds pretty top-notch.
speaker1: i want to help him find a buyer, and knows i'll try my darnedest. but-- and it pains me to say this-- there's a petition going around trying to rescind all of northlands' two diamond awards.
speaker2: what?!
speaker1: i know. but let's be honest, one of the core tenets of the two diamonds is commitment to and the way roger passed on... well, some folks are saying that type of activity isn't entirely "godly." tim shakes his head, disbelieving.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: you have to understand, this isn't some namby-pamby local event. this is a regional convention, tim. now, i want to help you, but you're going to have to help yourself too.
speaker1: let me give you a few extra drink coupons for horizons. get down there-- fellowship and network. buy a few drinks. let `em see the good side of northlands insurance-- the wholesome side, ok?
speaker2: thank you president helgesson.
speaker1: please. orin. and if you need anything, tim-- i mean anything-- i'm up in the tiffany suite. room 411. balcony overlooks the pool.

speaker1: timbo! over here roomie! 
speaker1: how's she hanging big tim? big time big tim...
speaker2: hello dean.
speaker1: it's deanzie, c'mon. ahoy cap'n, we got a thirsty sailor over here!

speaker2: ach, i'm busting your balls. you don't get out much, do you buddy? whoa, who'd you have to blow to get all those?
speaker4: i didn't... nobody. president helgesson gave them to me.
speaker2: smug trying to poison my roommate with his b-s propaganda.
speaker4: i really don't... orin, president helgesson, he wanted to help me meet people. just being friendly.
speaker2: wow-wow-wow, you are naã¯ve. a rail cocktail's, what, four bucks? times that by 10 drink coupons. we're talking 40 large, tim. doesn't sound so friendly anymore, does it? sounds more like one of these i-scratch- your-back-you-scratch-mine deals. i bet ol' orin invited you up to the tiffany suite, too, hmm? fourth floor? view of the pool? yup. buying your vote, pal.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: ronimal! taco bill! over here!
speaker2: bill hernandez. i call him taco bill. mexican.

speaker1: so big time tim, what're you looking for pussy-wise here in cedar crapids? 
speaker2: ah, that would be nothing...

speaker2: together 17 years. lucky if one of `em was decent. ass. hole.
speaker2: what i was talking about anyway, ronimal, is that from what i can deduce, young timbo lippe here has led a-- shall i say-- sheltered existence. and i think we oughta help him, y'know, aroo-aroo!
speaker3: asmi isn't a vacation for everybody, dean. end of the day, tim's here to work and to win. for his agency.

speaker4: oh, i don't, ah...
speaker7: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: ah... grenadine? please.

speaker1: careful you don't get too loaded, lippe, or i might have to take advantage of you. 
speaker2: it's been a super long day. i, ah, better... good night...
speaker2: hello bree.
speaker3: hey. hey.

speaker1: marlene's brother's back in the hospital, so bridge got canceled.

speaker1: wade. 
speaker2: he says hey.
speaker1: oh. tell him hey.
speaker2: tim says hey...
speaker2: i picked up that diet wet food for brandy today.
speaker1: i have to do some work before bed, so...

speaker1: no, it's-- i love you so bad, babygirl. it's so hard here. i just miss you. 
speaker2: i miss you, too, tim. but this was your decision. you have to act like a big boy now.
speaker1: tss. yeah, yeah. keep reminding me.
speaker2: you'll be fine. just be careful.
speaker1: ok. you, too. i love you.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 tim hangs up, world-weary.

speaker1: current risk mitigation mechanisms available to hog farm operations include futures and options to... 
speaker1: i'm in here!
speaker2: i know. this needs to be private.

speaker1: what the heck is going on here? 
speaker2: you sound like my wife, timbo. ex, i should say. ex.
speaker1: are you drunk?
speaker2: yeah! yeah. but we didn't get to finish our little confab back at the bar. i figured some out.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: like i told you, no shocker-- helgesson's buttering you up to get you in his camp, because he knows you and me are close...
speaker3: we're not close...
speaker2: close enough. you're voting for me for president, right?
speaker3: no i'm not.
speaker2: well anyway, there's a petition going around trying to take away your company's two diamond awards.
speaker3: i know. i heard.
speaker2: well hear this: after you left the bar, mike pyle comes up to me-- pyle of i call him-- and he asks do i want to sign this thing. and i go, "lemke might have been a class-a deviant, but the guy was as a rep..."
speaker3: pardon my french, dean, but that's a bunch of bull roar. my boss, bill krogstad? he told me how you called up joyce armbrã¼ster and smeared roger's name all over town...
speaker2: joyce who...? oh, no-no-no, whoa- whoa-whoa, that old called me. harping about lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere. so i says, "ok, i'll run some numbers." well, she calls back later that same day, says she got krogstad to lower her premium. which is all the greasy wanted in the first place.
speaker3: so wait, you didn't call her?
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: i may be a lot of things, but poacher ain't one of `em.
speaker3: so what's with this petition?
speaker2: personally? i think mike pyle of started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency. dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up northlands at a bargain basement price. and you know what else i think? i think orin's in on the deal somehow.
speaker3: what? that's impossible.
speaker2: i can't quite figure it myself, but i know what i know. and what i know is you're wading into some duvious, er dubious, just be careful.

speaker1: ... in your name we pray lord son of author of our salvation, our redeemer, our truth. amen. 
speaker2: orin knows how to lead a prayer breakfast, tell you what.
speaker3: hmm...? oh. yeah.
speaker2: little overwhelming? all this?
speaker3: hello, thank you. i feel like my head is gonna like... y'know?
speaker2: oh i hear ya l and c. loud and clear. i was the same way when i first came to asmi. the deciding which break-out sessions to attend, plus the politics, the pressure, the not knowing who to trust...
speaker3: excuse me, ronald. it's my boss.
speaker3: this is tim.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: tim. bill krogstad. got a call from orin helgesson. tells me he's worried about you. tells me you're palling around with dean ziegler. laughing at his jokes, buying him drinks... 
speaker2: i... no...
speaker1: what's the one thing i told you to do? the one thing, tim? steer clear of dean ziegler. goddamnit, you're lousing the whole thing up!
speaker3: bill...
speaker1: not now dione.
speaker2: bill, i... that dean ziegler-- he was trying to warn me about orin.
speaker1: warn you about orin? orin helgesson has been asmi midwest region president for 13 years! he is a legend! and what do you do?! you go and pal around with his sworn enemy-- who, p.s., is a drunken loser!
speaker2: bill, i'm sorry...
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: i sent you to asmi to restore our image, tim. one day into the deal you're lousing the whole thing up!
speaker1: see how far gladstone is from cedar rapids, dione. look in the atlas.
speaker3: you're not driving to iowa, bill.
speaker1: oh cripes, you know as well as i do that polack's gonna head for the hills the second he gets his papers. but no, you want to end up in the poor house, dione, we'll go. let's just keep on cashing checks we don't have...
speaker3: we are going to our daughter's wedding, bill.
speaker2: i didn't know i did anything wrong.
speaker1: well you better try doing something right, lippe. because if you keep lousing up, we all by starve! and don't you tell me to calm down dione!

speaker1: i'm a very bad girl. but i swear i only smoke in cedar rapids. care for a virginia slim, lippe? 
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: whoa, what's wrong?
speaker3: mm, i don't know. only everything.

speaker1: he didn't have to yell at me. i didn't do anything wrong. i'm trying my hardest. 
speaker2: d'you want me to kick his butt?
speaker1: could you?
speaker2: absolutely. i know krogstad. i could take him. `sides, i'm a ninja. a nin- jette, actually. hoo-waaaah!
speaker2: so lippe, how'd you end up in the insurance game? that sounded dorky-- insurance game. look here, see, how'd you end up in the insurance game, see...?
speaker1: you are freaky. no, it's kind of weird how i got interested in insurance, actually. when i was six, my dad got killed in a sawmill accident.
speaker2: oh my
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: yeah. not good. but after he died, our insurance agent fought like a tiger against the sawmill to make sure me and my mom were taken care of. and we were.
speaker1: the crazy thing-- our agent was actually bill krogstad.
speaker2: no way. really?
speaker1: he had just opened northlands. anyway, i remember thinking, this guy's a hero. a real hero. so even if he doesn't always treat me, like y'know... whatever now-- i'll never forget that.
speaker1: this river-- the cedar river? it flooded the whole city a couple years ago.
speaker2: i remember that. massive disaster.
speaker1: people talk about the firemen and policemen and that. but think about all the claims in a disaster like that-- how hard those agents worked to make sure people's lives weren't left in the lurch. we're talking billions of dollars in damages, literally. and claim by claim, dream by dream, those agents helped rebuild this city. i'm telling you, it's a noble calling. i really believe that.
speaker2: you realize you just made it sound cool to be an insurance salesman?
speaker1: tss. i wish.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: no, i can tell. you're the superman type. kind of dweeby on the surface but a real frickin' stud underneath. they'd call you insurance man-- put a big red "i" on your chest...
speaker1: well, even if you're being full of it, thanks for saying that anyway.
speaker2: well, you're welcome.
speaker2: so can you fly me back to the hotel, insurance man? i'm freezing my off.

speaker1: i'm saying a bridge to the 22nd century is a stupid theme, helgesson. not a one of us is even going to be alive in the 22nd century... 
speaker2: oh, and i suppose under a dean ziegler administration, we'd just abandon e-commerce and all that, huh? what's your take, ronald?
speaker3: end of the day, you know i'm a big supporter of yours, orin...
speaker1: stab me in the back why don't you, wilkes...
speaker3: why would i stab you in the back, dean, when i'm telling you to your face that i think you'd be a lousy president?
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: timbo! sorry about that gigantic i got while we were spooning.
speaker5: we didn't spoon, orin...
speaker2: to each his own, tim. i'm teasing, of course. well, i gotta run to an executive council meeting. you fellas really ought to check out mike pyle's prop/cas seminar...
speaker1: pyle of
speaker2: mike's a dynamite orator. i think you'd enjoy it. we'll see ya.
speaker1: smug so who's ready for a drink?
speaker3: it's 11 in the morning.
speaker1: it's 11 in the morning. can you believe this guy? c'mon timbo, let's get the flock outta here.
speaker5: you need to leave me alone.
speaker6: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: i'd like to share a humorous anecdote. a gentleman is drowning in a lake or pond, and he's 20 feet offshore. well, along comes an actuary. and this actuary sees the drowning gentleman and throws him an 11 foot rope. and the gentleman says, "but i'm 20 feet offshore!" and the actuary says, "well, i'm meeting you more than halfway." the room busts up laughing. tim takes notes. 
speaker1: so property/casualty insurance, or prop/cas, it's one of the most dynamic areas of our industry...
speaker1: ah, is there a tim lip in here? there's an emergency call.
speaker2: hello.
speaker3: herro mr. tim, my name chin chang.
speaker2: millie? something happened...?
speaker3: ah, you wise man mr. tim. she die in horrible car accident...
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 tim's stomach drops.
speaker3: ... but her dying wish for you, mr. tim, to get shit-face with deanzie.
speaker5: timbo! turn around!
speaker6: gentlemen! i will call security.
speaker2: what the h did i ever do to you, you a-hole.
speaker5: come on bud, i was having fun.
speaker2: i just wanted to hear your voice.
speaker7: brandy, no! bad girl! sorry, she's giving me grief over this new wet food. what did you need now, tim?
speaker2: nothing. nothing really...
speaker7: well i for one feel like i ought to be on the fire department, i'm putting out so many fires. lucy kofnetka asked me to do altar guild for her. again.
speaker8: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: oh.
speaker7: patti told me lucy's seeing some guy who doesn't even go to church, so she apparently feels no need to maintain her responsibil... brandy! no! she's going number two on the floor! no! you get outside! i'll call you later, tim... he hangs up. he exhales. he looks out the window: an

speaker1: i'd like to sign up for the scavenger hunt. 
speaker2: super. teaming with a co-worker or are you in need of a partner? this is a team event, like the amazing race. on tv? but instead of going around the world, you look for stuff in cedar rapids. and instead of a million dollars, the winning team gets a $75 gift card for westdale, which is...
speaker1: eastern iowa's largest two-story mall. i know. sweet. and yes, i do have a teammate.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: everything ok?
speaker5: yeah, what was that call?
speaker1: oh, nothing. say joan, you have something on your blouse.
speaker1: burn.
speaker5: you are very weird...
speaker1: thank you. thank you very much.
speaker1: so, ah, i signed you up for the scavenger hunt. to be my teammate.
speaker5: really? why?
speaker1: uh, well i... because ronald already had a teammate...
speaker4: bill hernandez?
speaker5: taco bill.
speaker1: ... and i thought you'd-- we'd-- be y'know, a decent team. so... i think you should do it.
speaker5: heck yeah! i get to be insurance man's sidekick. we're going to kick some ass!
speaker6: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: like last year there'll be a few physical challenges... 
speaker2: i am super pumped!
speaker3: whoo-hoo.
speaker1: course this should be considered a fun event, in the spirit of team building. you can find your first clue "under the sea." by which i mean in the pool area. so ready, set, race!
speaker2: you're going down, a-hole.
speaker4: let's roll, perry-- perry-plegic.
speaker5: yeah. good one, dean-tard. like retard, but dean-tard. get it?

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: check it out-- planet x!
speaker2: i compiled a ton of info on cedar rapids. i've got a sweet laminator in my basement.
speaker3: ooh, that's hot...
speaker2: ... maps, area attractions, crime stats, local customs...
speaker3: look at you...
speaker2: bingo! right here-- planet x family fun center. let's go. act natural.
speaker3: what a gyp. there are no stinkin' clues in here.

speaker1: ok, i think we're going to want to take blair's ferry road to avenue c, then probably east on 100. 
speaker2: why would you possibly know that?
speaker1: i memorized the major thoroughfares and landmarks in the metro area.

speaker1: know what that cow's thinking, pyle? she's thinking, "quit pulling on my and me already." 
speaker2: ugh. i'm gonna puke.
speaker3: no, you're doing great, joan. and you look super awesome with a wiener in your mouth.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: oh my did you just make a joke, lippe?
speaker3: no. maybe.

speaker1: ok guys, this is it. first team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin' match. asmi's past is behind us; but our future looks nice; let's build a bridge to the 22nd century... by scaling this silo of ice! 
speaker2: that doesn't even... there's no such thing as silo ice climbing.
speaker3: no, it's actually a big thing in iowa. abc news did a story about it. i saw it on youtube.
speaker2: of course you did. well, you can do it then...
speaker3: uh-uh, absolutely not. i'm scared crapless of heights.
speaker2: you need to get over it, lippe, cuz i'm not climbing jack.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: come on insurance man-- leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that...
speaker3: yeah. let's do this thing.
speaker3: hang on... how's it...?
speaker4: little help here...

speaker1: ugh. this is frickin' hard. 
speaker2: really hard.
speaker3: i think i just my pants.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: ok gang, that was rick martini with the national chapter. here's the deal. since no one could do the final task, and since joan and tim were the first team to get here, we're just gonna go ahead and award them the first place prize. unless anyone's got a problem with that?
speaker3: dangit. you could've done better, wilkes.
speaker4: wait, we won?
speaker2: yup. so here you guys go. your $75 gift card for the westdale mall.

speaker1: oh crap. i forgot... 
speaker1: hey, millie.
speaker2: i have been trying to reach you for the last eight hours, timothy. i was going to call the police. where have you been?
speaker1: i'm sorry, mil. i signed up for this scavenger hunt, and check it out-- we won! my teammate and i, that is. joan.
speaker3: hi millie!
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: that was joan saying hi. millie says hi.
speaker2: i did not say hi. i didn't say anything. if you had asked, i would have told you that i've been at the vet half the day because brandy swallowed a pencil eraser.
speaker2: lucky for us it came out naturally or we'd have been looking at surgery.
speaker3: i'll just meet you inside.
speaker1: ok. sounds good.
speaker1: sorry mil, go ahead.
speaker2: so who's this joan?
speaker1: just some gal from omaha they paired me up with. between you and me, she's a little different. real hyper-- one of these types who kind of overdoes it. but for a 75 dollar gift card, i'm not going to complain.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: you promised you'd check in with me. i'm very disappointed.
speaker1: ok, mom...

speaker1: well. you obviously have more important things to do than talk to me. my brother and i were just getting ready to go for fish at the eagles anyhow. 
speaker1: go warm up the car, wade.
speaker2: mil, i didn't...
speaker1: it's fine. you'll call me some time when it's convenient for you, tim. good night.

speaker1: hey. what say we just use the gift certificate to get a nice supper here? at the mall. 
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 joan smiles at him, and we:

speaker1: we have a gift card. but i didn't make a reservation. is that ok? 
speaker2: right this way, sir.

speaker1: coors lite for the madam. a cream sherry for monsieur. and here are some bottomless bread sticks. 
speaker2: nice. thanks.
speaker2: to victory. to new friends. to life.
speaker3: that's really nice. cheers.
speaker2: mm, it does taste a lot like communion wine. awesome.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: so lippe, i'm trying to figure you out. hopes, dreams, aspirations, blah-blah-blah? whaddaya got? 
speaker2: mine? let's see. um. i would love-- some day-- to put a little greenhouse in my backyard.
speaker1: dream the impossible dream...
speaker2: no, i've actually seen some fairly decent portable ones at fleet farm that won't break the bank...
speaker1: c'mon, man. i mean fantasy-land stuff. what do you really want?
speaker2: well. i always hoped i could take over northlands when bill retired. but that obviously isn't going to happen now.
speaker1: oh, screw him. he wants to sell, why don't you just buy northlands?
speaker2: yeah right.
speaker1: why not? you could get a loan.
speaker2: i don't... probably not.
speaker1: you know the business. you know the clients. you actually care about your job. you'd be perfect.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: grrrr. ha. time out. sheesh. let's.
speaker2: ok. what i'd really like is a family. to be a dad. so kids, i guess, that's what i really want.
speaker1: yeah well, you can have mine.
speaker2: you've got kids?
speaker1: tyler's ten. ashley'll be eight next month. my little squirrels.
speaker2: awesome. beautiful kids. and that's...?
speaker1: my hubby. rich fox. richie. we met when we were both rotary exchange students in high school. lived in norway for a semester.
speaker2: norway.
speaker1: i was such a spaz. band geek, total ugly duckling-- braces, acne, the whole nine. i didn't even get until college. anyway, we ended up getting married sophomore year. then kids. then blah-blah-blah, and here we are. richie's a supervisor in the parks department now. for the county.
speaker2: wow.
speaker1: i know it's effed up. and if i had it all to do over again, i don't know what i'd choose.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: but i don't have that option. so this is my fantasy-land, tim. cedar rapids. asmi. this. i come here, and for a few days i'm someone else. no kids. no husband. no responsibility. wild woman. sometimes a gal just needs a vacation from who she really is-- know what i mean, lippe?

speaker1: ok. i thought of another one. 
speaker2: one what?
speaker1: wish. or dream or whatever. it's still small potatoes compared to...
speaker2: no, let's hear it...
speaker1: ... to all you've done-- norway and all that, but...
speaker1: do you watch american idol ever?
speaker2: you wanna be on american idol?
speaker1: no-no-no. negative! sheesh. but i do enjoy watching it quite a bit. randy's always like, "that's awesome, dawg!" and simon's such a-- "oh, i'm so superior."
speaker1: anyhow i was thinking of maybe trying-- trying-- to get a solo in my choir. at church. i mean, it's all super political. but i'm a fair to middlin' baritone, so...
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: that's great, tim. you'll do it. i know you will. very cool.
speaker2: wanna get one for the road, stud?
speaker1: oh no, i have to practice my two diamond presentation. i can't...
speaker2: one nightcap. it'll loosen you up.
speaker1: ha. nightcap. kneecap, more like...
speaker2: what?
speaker1: yes.

speaker1: timbo and the o-fox! wondered when you crazy kids were gonna show up. 
speaker2: can i buy the big-shot winners a drink? coors lite for joan. and tim, you want a pop?
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: actually, do they have cream sherry?
speaker2: cream sherry. jeez, guess that victory really did go to your head.
speaker5: coors lite's good for me, thanks. i gotta run wash my hands quick.
speaker1: you tag that yet, timbo? bet she's moist as a damp sponge, huh?
speaker4: she is married. and you're just...
speaker1: what isn't wrong me? i drink too much, i weigh too much, i people off. speaking of, that crank call earlier-- way outta line.
speaker4: well. yeah. you kind of are. but i guess i've seen worse.
speaker1: i love it! "i guess i've seen worse." i love it! yeah s'pose we all wish our lives had gone a little different. you don't come into this deal going, "dear please let my wife toss me out on my ass. please give my children the courage to hate my guts. thank you praise praise jesus!" ach, i'm just having fun.
speaker6: no offense big man! right, timbo?
speaker7: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: ronald! hello. thanks mucho... so ronald, what's your situation? you married, or...?
speaker2: negative. i'm pretty well married to ronald wilkes insurance. i also do quite a bit of work with the st. cloud chamber. i'm senior warden at my church. so really, no time for a mrs. ronald wilkes.
speaker4: wow.
speaker2: don't get me wrong, i have my guilty pleasures-- antiquing, i'm active in community theater. and i have to admit i'm a big enthusiast of the hbo program, the wire. but shux, i haven't had a proper vacation in nine years.
speaker4: i never use my vacation time.
speaker1: maybe you two should take one of those gay cruises together.
speaker2: you know what you are ziegler? you're what i call a real richard.
speaker2: mr. richard head.
speaker4: head. yeah dean, you are a total richard!
speaker1: ha! i love it! richard head!
speaker8: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: to tim-- the young rookie comes in, takes the scavenger hunt. that right there is p-t. prime time.

speaker1: would you rather toss a bum's salad, y'know, eat out his or... give your dad a b-j? 
speaker2: come on ziegler, this is supposed to be a clean game...
speaker3: no, if you used some salad dressing a bum's a-hole might not taste that bad. thousand island!
speaker4: shots! kamikazes, good sir.
speaker5: ok. we're ready for tim lip to rock the mic. is there a tim lip?
speaker3: did he just...?
speaker4: why wait for the church choir when you can take care of one of your dreams right now, dude?
speaker3: no, no, no, no, no...
speaker4: i know you can do it, lippe. go be my hero-- insurance man.
speaker6: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker5: tim lip? you in the house?
speaker3: i, um, i've met some really, just super neat people here. but this song, i'd like to dedicate to the first african-american person i've ever met. i mean, i've seen guys at the oneida mall in rhinelander-- said hello and that. but... anyway, i just think you're one of the most awesome guys around. ronald wilkes!
speaker3: i was born and raised down in alabama. on a farm way back up in the woods. i was so ragged that folks used to call me patches. papa used to tease me about it. but deep down inside he was hurt, 'cause he'd done all he could.
speaker3: my papa was a great old man. i can see him with a shovel in his hands. see education he never had; he did wonders when the times got bad. the little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made.

speaker1: the presentation's in 36 hours. i can't afford to be off my game. frankly, neither can you, tim. 
speaker1: this is ridiculous, you guys. told you, it closed an hour ago.
speaker1: tim. come on. this isn't you.
speaker2: uh-oh. who is it then?
speaker1: you know what i mean. we've both worked our tails off. why it away on...

speaker1: check this out-- captain nemo! 
speaker2: i know. i just...
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: no frickin' way!

speaker1: whaddaya say, lippe? take a dippy? 
speaker2: ich can nicht schwimmen. that's "i can't swim." in german. and i can't. `sides, i didn't bring a bathing suit.
speaker1: so we stay in the shallow end. and neither did i.
speaker2: yow. chilly. ha.

speaker2: good morning.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: crisis on the home front. sorry if i woke you up.
speaker2: no problemo.
speaker2: is that...? were you looking at my two diamond presentation?
speaker1: your cell phone kept ringing in your little pack thing, so i shut it off. when i saw the discs, i figured i'd take a look. it's a solid presentation.
speaker2: um. thanks. it was roger lemke's...
speaker1: yeah, i see that.
speaker1: you know we were together right?
speaker2: what? whaddaya...? you and... you and roger, you mean?
speaker1: it's so stupid-- but everyone basically treated us like the brangelina of asmi for a while there. it ended two years ago. he was getting into some pretty weird stuff... as we all know now.
speaker1: come on, lippe. it doesn't matter.
speaker2: my foot i knew! no, i did not. and yes, it most certainly does matter.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: tell me you're not jealous. you can't be jealous. the guy's dead.
speaker2: every stinkin' place i go people remind me: you're no roger lemke. you're not as good as roger lemke.
speaker1: as good? tim, roger was a small- minded, egotistical jerk. you're an infinitely better man than he was.
speaker2: why were you with him then?
speaker1: why? i don't know. i don't know. i guess i probably maybe don't like myself very much. i don't know.
speaker2: hey, hey. come on. you're pretty and smart and just super awesome.
speaker2: i like you.
speaker2: grrr. i'm so frickin' confused. last thing i thought was that i'd come to cedar rapids and fall in love.
speaker1: what are you talking about?
speaker2: us. this.
speaker1: what this? what are you talking about? there's no this. there's no us. i have a family.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: what about...?
speaker1: what about it? i told you, what i do here... in cedar rapids... it stays here.
speaker2: where the heck are my clothes?
speaker1: come on, tim. we're adults here.
speaker2: yeah. well, you're acting like a fricking... prostitute.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: i'm really, really sorry ronald. if i said anything, or...
speaker3: hey, it's not ronald wilkes's job to judge you, tim. end of the day, the lord's got that covered. but am i disappointed? you bet i am. heck, i'm all for having fun. but i didn't think you were one of these guys who comes down here only to get loaded and act like a derelict.
speaker2: no, i'm not. i...
speaker4: timbo! ronimal!
speaker4: you should have stuck around last night, ronimal. watching timbo and the o-fox get it on in the pool-- i was harder than chinese arithmetic.
speaker3: what a couple of class acts. i'm running late for the prayer breakfast. oh and tim, bill krogstad's been trying to reach you all morning. fyi.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: i may as well just commit suicide...
speaker3: father of the bride. we're set.
speaker2: yah. be there in a...
speaker2: call me when you get this tim. because unless you pull off a miracle, we're done. you've let me down hard. cripes... shaping up to be the worst day of my life.
speaker2: you look real beautiful, kayla. like a flower.

speaker1: goddarnit! 
speaker2: that time of the month? c'mon man, it's gonna be ok.
speaker1: no it's not. nothing is ok. my job, my fiancã©... i'm a philanderer. i've let bill down. i've let everybody down.
speaker2: c'mere, kiddo. sit. sit down.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: my ex, patti? well-established fact that this broad is a serious cuntstain, right? but like i say, she's made it pretty much so the kids hate my guts-- i'm the bad guy. `cept when our 17-year-old daughter comes home pregnant-- oh yeah, happy day in the ziegler household, lemme tell ya-- who's the one so depressed that she can't get out from under the afghan on the couch? patti. and who's the one planning the baby showers and taking meg to the gyno, all that the deanzie. that's who. tim stares at dean for an incredulous moment.
speaker1: is this...? why is this all of a sudden about you, dean?
speaker2: i'm telling you this, buddy, because it shows to go ya-- even if you're a waste of space like myself, there's always opportunities to do the right thing. if this two diamond and that matters so much, you'll find a way to make it right. if not, it. life's way too short to lose sleep over that don't matter.

speaker1: without any more ado, our keynote speaker, iowa insurance commissioner, mrs. susan voss! 
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker3: president helgesson, please let me stay in the two diamond contest. please. this isn't for me-- it's for bill krogstad. i can't let him down. please just let me compete.

speaker1: tiffany suite. bit much. perks of the presidency, guess you'd say. please. have a seat on the davenport. 
speaker1: drink?
speaker2: ah, no. thanks.
speaker1: suit yourself.
speaker2: this is the petition?
speaker1: between you and me-- this was a ploy by mike pyle. trying to drive down the value of northlands so he could get it on the cheap.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: i just made that happen. poof. gone. rainmaker. northlands keeps its three previous two diamond awards.
speaker2: oh my gosh, really? thank you.
speaker1: one thing roger lemke knew, tim? he knew that when you get all dolled up, go to the prom-- the big dance-- that you gotta be prepared to put out. to show a little teat. you ever hear of paypal, tim?
speaker2: paypal? um, yeah. i've used it to pay for beanie babies on e-bay...
speaker2: for my fiancã©.
speaker1: good. thing you gotta ask yourself now is this: "am i ready to dance?
speaker2: i don't understand what you mean...
speaker1: calm down, orin. i'm sorry. please, let's talk e-commerce for a minute.
speaker1: four years ago, the brain trust at asmi national mandated we go "on- line" for everything. billing, newsletter, the whole shebang. now i'm almost 70-years-old-- i's about as likely to figure this deal out as i was to learn chinese. well, as you know roger lemke was a real whiz on the computer...
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: you bet.
speaker1: so roger's up here looking over this new system, and he gets one of these lightbulb-going-off kinda looks, the way he did. and he says, "orin, with that newsletter going digital you're saving almost four grand a year in printing costs alone. four grand. pure profit." you see where this is going, tim?
speaker2: i can't say that i do...
speaker1: paypal. that's where. what has asmi ever given orin helgesson? huh? not dime one. sure as shoot not an opportunity to serve on the national board. have i not been a good president? do i not deserve a little something?
speaker2: you're an awesome president...
speaker1: you're right i am!
speaker1: but i don't know the first blessed thing about this paypal deal. roger had the on-line know-how, not me.
speaker2: i'm still not reading you here...
speaker1: there aren't printing costs anymore, see? the asmi-teer's digital. e- commerce! don't you get it, tim? all that money-- almost 39-hundred dollars a year-- that goes into a paypal account now. my paypal account. but i've got no idea how to use it.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: do you literally mean you just need help, like, getting on-line, or...?
speaker1: your performance in that scavenger hunt was first-rate. then i see you in the pool making love to that floozy, i realize maybe you've got a bit of lemke's, shall we say, moral ambiguity. i need that.
speaker2: you're talking about stealing.
speaker1: pontoon boats don't pay for themselves, tim. roger lemke came to the prom. he showed me a little teat. i rewarded him with the two diamonds three years running. i'm prepared to do the same for you. what do you say? you take home those those two diamonds, northlands' value skyrockets, bill krogstad retires to his time share. everybody wins...
speaker2: i'd be doing it for northlands-- to keep it in brown valley and help my co-workers. to help bill...
speaker2: what would you need me to do exactly...?
speaker1: ok, marvelous!

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: vote for deanzie. vote for change.
speaker3: i'm good thanks.
speaker2: well you very much, carla.
speaker2: i can count on your vote tomorrow, right ronimal?
speaker4: not a snowball's chance in hades.
speaker2: you're all a bunch of dicks.
speaker4: hey there, hangover harry. 18 hours and counting. got your guns loaded for the two diamonds, partner?
speaker5: um. i... i don't know about that.
speaker4: don't be nervous. you'll do fine. there's a prayer circle tonight before the entertainment program-- might help ease your mind.
speaker5: i'm sorry about... ronald. just... about everything...

speaker1: happy saturday! what'cha drinkin'? 
speaker2: a large cream sherry, please.
speaker1: looks like you could use some cheering up. what do you call it when it rains chickens and ducks?
speaker1: fowl weather.
speaker2: that's pretty hilarious.
speaker2: another please. i have to use the little boy's room.

speaker1: bree? it's tim lippe. from the asmi convention. we met out in front of the holidome across the street? 
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: that's what you get from smoking all those-- what'd you call `em, heaters? smoker's cough. ha. just kidding. butterscotch?
speaker1: small world, huh?
speaker3: totally. you wanna party?
speaker1: ooh, that's really awesome of you to ask. but i have a super important presentation in the morning unfortunately, so...
speaker4: i gotta work in the morning, too. can't be productive or whatever without occasionally taking a little ride on the good times express. it's like, that yo.
speaker1: yeah. i hear that. l and c. loud and... clear.
speaker3: seriously. we're going to this thing at my uncle ken's later-- after his shift's done.
speaker3: you look like you're in serious need of some relaxation, dude.
speaker1: i have had a pretty messed up day actually. might not hurt to forget about it for a little while.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: my advice, mike? pull the trigger. i've pretty well convinced him that his company's in the crapper. 85- thousand is as low as i could possibly get him. 
speaker2: he's said nothing to indicate i'd have to hang onto his employees or the office up there, right?
speaker1: bill was real clear about that. you're buying his clients-- not his brand. you've done this before, mike. the northlands policies will simply roll over into your allstate office in milwaukee. unless you want to keep a satellite branch up there in north palookaville.
speaker2: ok. let's pull the trigger.
speaker1: oh, and mike-- we're square on my consultant's fee?
speaker2: ten percent, as agreed.
speaker1: marvelous. now just give me a second here...

speaker1: we're all systems go over here, bill. 
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker3: praise christ! this is super, orin!
speaker1: i was able to get pyle up to 81- thousand for you, bill, which is pretty amazing given all the... the tribulations and that. of course that number doesn't include my 15 percent consultant's fee.

speaker1: y'know what orin, it's only a seven hour drive to cedar rapids. if i leave right now, i can be there first thing in the a-m and we can lock this sonofagun down. 
speaker2: i wouldn't want to put you out, bill, but it would be nice to put pen to paper on a contract sooner than later.
speaker1: yes. you bet. it's no problem. i'll be there in time to see the two diamond presentations-- not that that matters to me anymore! thanks a million, orin!
speaker1: dione, the deal's going through! 81- grand! we're getting this albatross off our backs after all. i'm going to cedar rapids.
speaker3: no, bill...
speaker1: goddamnit, dione, not now. this is happening. no flex on this one!
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: ... you can't handle the truth! 
speaker2: we used to get bands, ronald. real bands. kansas. reo speedwagon... remember reo let me get on stage and play tambourine?
speaker3: i'll go ahead and admit, this is an odd choice for an asmi headliner.
speaker1: danny isn't here mrs. torrance!
speaker4: are you ready for this? mike pyle of just bought northlands. word is the liquidating timbo and the whole brown valley operation.
speaker3: what? holy smokes. does tim know?
speaker2: don't look at me. i don't think tim likes me very much anymore.
speaker4: cry me a river, honey. this isn't about you for once.
speaker2: off, dean. jackass.
speaker3: hey. come on you guys. cut it out.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: i said, i'm not gonna hurt ya. i'm just going to bash your brains in.
speaker4: you two are a couple of serious downers, man. timbo left here in a huff a few hours ago-- you saw him ronimal. maybe he already knew. the kid's one of my best friends...
speaker3: you met him two days ago, ziegler.
speaker4: know what, blow me ronald. it's not my fault you're too afraid to open up and tell another man you love him. do what you want, but the deanzie's gonna make sure his friend is doing ok.

speaker1: that must be pretty all right, ken, getting half off at applebee's all the time. i'd only weigh like 10- thousand pounds... 
speaker2: pass me that cube, skeet.
speaker1: ah...? this would be marijuana, i'm guessing?
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: the glass dick, dude.
speaker1: oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez.
speaker4: a butterscotch might help.

speaker1: hello. 
speaker2: trying to reach tim lippe. who am i talking to?
speaker1: this is kay over at the applebee's.
speaker2: that right? is he there now?
speaker3: no he's not. be honest, i was kinda worried about the little guy...

speaker1: like i say, he was pretty ripped from all that sherry. he left with ken and them for some party. 
speaker2: who's ken?
speaker1: ken's our cook. we all think he deals dope, though. i get along good with everyone. but ken? he's just real different.
speaker3: oh jeez. d'you know where they were going? any idea?
speaker1: you could try ken's place. it's way out in the boonies...

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: my mom became real protective of me after my dad passed. she didn't really let me play sports or any of that. fact, if i think about it, i never really did much of anything.
speaker3: well you're livin' now. here.
speaker3: i bought some pills, too. here. these'll make you feel better.
speaker2: thanks. it's funny, though, because my job is all about protecting other people's dreams. but what about my dreams?
speaker3: it could be like-- maybe... whoa, shit's tight... like maybe it has to do with your parents both dying? like, maybe by protecting other people-- it's like you're trying to save your parents. like somehow you feel like it's your fault? like in your sub-conscience?
speaker3: and so you're not really like, living your own life fully? but dude, let me tell you this: the only real insurance in this life-- is love.
speaker3: oh baby, c'mere. c'mere.
speaker3: you can my if you want.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: faggot. watch out. 
speaker2: i'll be standing by `case things get squirrelly in there. getaway vehicle type scenario.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: so you're sending me into that shithole? how chivalrous, dean.
speaker5: you and me can go in, joan. it'll be fine, i'm sure...

speaker1: nice 
speaker2: thanks. thank you. that's nice.
speaker3: we don't want any trouble, guys. we're just looking for our friend.

speaker1: mm-mow-mow... two tickets to paradise. hmm-hmm, pack your bags we'll leave tonight... 
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: oh 
speaker2: but he paid for it, uncle ken...
speaker3: you can't let some dude pay for crystal meth and an with a traveler's check, bree. that can be traced.
speaker4: it's fully insured. 100 percent.
speaker3: shut the up.
speaker5: hey! hey!
speaker5: i may look like some suit wearin' businessman to y'all. truth is, i'm straight up gangsta. and i always keeps one in the chamber... ... in case you ponderin'. so i suggest for the time being that you let my be. muthafucka.
speaker5: indeed.
speaker6: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: oh 
speaker2: run!

speaker1: what the happened? 
speaker2: oh my tim. are you ok?
speaker3: i don't know. i don't know. all i know is i was getting kicked and then ronald was there talking like a ghetto person...
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker5: in order to extricate tim from what was clearly a volatile situation, i did, in fact, rely on my community theater training. i don't like to brag, but i do a pretty convincing omar from the hbo program, the wire. least them crackers back yonder seemed to buy it.
speaker1: the ronimal!

speaker1: i can't believe bill would do this to me. he was like a father... 
speaker2: wasn't just krogstad, timbo. orin's the real devil in this deal.
speaker3: you'll find another job, lippe.
speaker4: shoot, you could come work for me if you wanted.
speaker1: i love you, joan.
speaker3: get some sleep you guys. i'll stay up with him-- make sure he doesn't chew his arm off.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: sleep good, little friend.
speaker1: i didn't make love to bree, joan.
speaker3: it doesn't matter. here, lie down, lippe.
speaker3: oh dear, what can the matter be johnny's so long at the fair. he promised to bring me a pocket of posies... tim shuts his eyes. joan must be a good mom.

speaker1: i always wanna call you "friend!" sweet love showin' us a heavenly... tim opens up the trunk. that's when we see: 
speaker1: careful. it's super slippery.
speaker1: whoop. careful now.
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker3: nmmmmmmmmm!
speaker1: i did a ton of research on hog farm risk mitigation. don't worry-- they might bite you a little if they think you're a food source. but there's never been a recorded hog- bite death. so...
speaker1: the two diamonds may be meaningless to you and bill. but there are people who care about this stuff. ronald wilkes. even dean. honest, good people. i'll come back for you after the two diamonds have been handed out to a legitimate winner. i'm really sorry about this, orin, but the insurance industry deserves better than you.

speaker1: who the heck's calling at this hour on a sunday morning? 
speaker2: hello.
speaker3: kurt gambsky, tim lippe-- your insurance agent. how's pam and the girls?
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker2: tim lippe.
speaker2: um, fine, tim. we're fine.
speaker3: well, i think everything's ok. hope it is anyway. listen kurt, here's why i'm calling...

speaker1: people sometimes say that promises are cheap. you know what ronald wilkes says to that? n-s-f. not so fast. at the end of the day, a man's word is a sacred creed. and the word i give you at ronald wilkes insurance is-- i will work for you. thank you. 
speaker2: once again folks, president helgesson left a note under my door this morning saying he had to leave asmi early due to a family emergency. i haven't been able to reach him on his mobile, but obviously our thoughts and prayers go out to orin and his family.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: now... we're set to hear our final two diamond presenter. tim lip from northlands insurance. tim?
speaker3: hey travis, i don't think tim...
speaker4: thank you. i'm tim lippe. hog farm risk mitigation... what is...?
speaker4: smooth move, ex-lax. so, hog... no. i, ah... this girl i met, sorry woman, i guess. she's 23. she takes drugs, and i think might be some kind of prostitute. but she's super insightful. y'know what she said to me last night? said the only real insurance is love. that's fricking intense, isn't it...?
speaker4: i'm... ah... our only true safety net. love. crazy. i believe in insurance. i believe in love...
speaker4: bill! bill krogstad. my former boss, everybody.
speaker5: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker6: what're you doing, lippe?
speaker4: why'd you do this, bill? i don't understand.
speaker4: why'd you do it, bill? why'd you do it? why'd you lie, bill?
speaker6: sorry, folks. guess it's against the law now for a business owner to sell his own business. must've missed that constitutional amendment.
speaker4: insurance isn't just a business, bill. insurance is personal. i've got some savings. i could've gotten a loan. we could've worked something out.
speaker6: yeah, there's a guy you want running an agency, isn't it?
speaker6: come on, tim, you're tired. you're looking foolish here. you couldn't run an agency if your life depended on it.
speaker4: screw you, bill. screw you... hard.
speaker4: that's a bunch of dog crap. you and lemke, that... pervert... you stole my ideas and called them your own for years. and i didn't say squat-- because i figured we were like a family. i may not have quite as many clients as roger had.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: i care about them. and guess what, they care about me. fact, i've called more than half of them already this morning...
speaker3: watch yourself, lippe...
speaker2: i knew which ones would be on their way to church, which ones i'd be waking up, which ones probably got a little blotto last night and might be hung over... and every single person i talked to-- every one-- is staying with me.
speaker3: you don't know what you're doing.
speaker2: i do actually. i do know, bill. and before the day is out, i'll have called all my clients. all of them. so hey, congratulations pyle of shit-- you just bought a company that's losing half its business.
speaker4: yeah timbo!
speaker5: right there, officer. that's him.

speaker1: what's the charge? 
speaker2: here.
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker1: what's this?
speaker2: you'll figure it out.

speaker1: i know what you're thinking-- thinking "this wiseacre's full of baloney." am i right? 
speaker1: but i'm telling you reginald, you're actually a perfect candidate for term life...
speaker2: tim lip?
speaker3: he pronounce it like lippy.
speaker2: well, you're outta here, lippe.
speaker1: i'm serious. call any time-- on the mobile or home phone, though. the office number's no good anymore.
speaker3: thanks tim. you're all right.
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: don't even say it, deanzie-- no one rammed me or whatever in there. 
speaker2: "butt ram!" i love it!
speaker2: want your get out of jail free card back?
speaker1: not particularly.
speaker2: when i saw it, at first i was like, am i supposed to take money out of the account, or what?
speaker1: did you?
speaker2: nah, it was more fun watching the smug sweat. i told him i'd rat his pathetic out if he didn't drop the charges against you.
speaker1: sweet.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: it's not as cool as i thought it'd be. i don't think this is even real wood.
speaker3: i'll show you some real wood.

speaker1: well. 
speaker2: deep subject. d'aar. get it? i told you you were a hero, lippe.
speaker1: tss. ruined it more like.
speaker2: true sign of a good day.
speaker3: well, pal, it's been real.
speaker1: i'm gonna miss you guys.
speaker4: yeah. you bet.
speaker3: listen, my cousin bob-- guy made a truckload selling these little scented pine trees all the ragheads hang in their cabs? believe that? anyhow, he's got a sweet cottage up on lake of the woods. canada? i can use it whenever i want.

speaker1: cedar rapids, 6-12-09 
speaker2: i say we book it for june, before the mosquitoes go apeshit up there.
speaker3: more time in a tightly enclosed space with ziegler. gee, sign me up.
speaker4: i think it sounds awesome.
speaker3: actually, me too. the ronimal could use a vacation.
speaker2: done.
speaker5: so. keep in touch. e-mail, all that good stuff.
speaker4: you bet. you bet. you too.
speaker5: if you're ever-- not that you would be-- ever in oh-my-god, nebraska...
speaker4: yeah. mutual of omaha's wild kingdom. i used to watch that.
speaker5: yeah. look me up.
speaker4: so.

speaker1: how's the walleye? 
speaker2: decent. not bad.
speaker1: meatloaf's on the dry side.
speaker2: mm.
speaker1: what's...?
speaker3: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker4: where were they hidin' the meatloaf...?

speaker1: you're just gonna attract red squirrels with that junk, tim. 
speaker2: how ya doin' there, leslie?
speaker3: ach, i'm too old to give a
speaker3: bill krogstad told me he's switching our policy to some fella down in milwaukee. allstate. says i won't notice a bit of difference in coverage or nothin'.
speaker2: no, you probably won't.
speaker3: mm. anyhow, i told the to go himself. says i'm going with tim lippe. a man i can trust.
speaker3: it's a good thing you're doin'-- keepin' work in brown valley.
speaker2: i'm trying...
speaker4: cedar rapids, 6-12-09
speaker3: let me know when them red squirrels show up at your feeder. i'll borrow you my 22.
speaker2: the chances we take in life are called risks.

speaker1: we pay insurance companies premiums as a way of hedging our bets, in case those risks we take cause us or our property harm. 
speaker1: that's the point of insurance-- so we can live and love life to the fullest.
speaker1: at tim lippe insurance, we can't guarantee that you'll live your life without devastating losses. but we can give you peace of mind-- knowing that if something awful or unfortunate does happen-- we'll have you covered. tim lippe insurance. insuring your home and your hopes.
speaker2: cedar rapids, 6-12-09

speaker1: can i be honest here, tim? 
speaker2: you bet.
speaker3: what was with the unicorn?
speaker2: what? it represented hope...
speaker1: all's i'm saying is you might've wanted to hire an actor with some professional training...
speaker3: jesus-- a retarded kid just sitting there yelling would've been better than you.
speaker2: aw, you're both a couple of a- holes...
