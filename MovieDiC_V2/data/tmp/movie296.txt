speaker2: when i was three!
speaker1: i don't want to talk about it!
speaker2: you brought it up!

speaker1: we don't accept drunks! 
speaker2: we c-couldn't stop him.

speaker3: martin!... martin!...
speaker3: he went with that cow! i'll scratch her eyes out!

speaker5: `playing'? we don't `play'! what we do is deadly serious!

speaker1: gone. will we miss him? i don't think so. 
speaker1: don't worry if you don't understand it immediately.
speaker2: he's doing his bit to save the human race. he thinks it's got a future. quaint, eh? i keep telling him to get a proper job. check it out.. another night with nothing in the kitty.

speaker1: test your imagination! envisage the sublime. let doctor parnassus be your guide. discover the heights of wisdom...
speaker1: ... or, if you will, visit the doldrums with all that's vile and stinks.
speaker2: take a ticket and wait your turn. twenty quid a go, reduced to five for one night only!
speaker1: the world is full of wonders, beauty, enchantment, for those with eyes to see...

speaker2: it's not fair.
speaker3: it's the fair, but it's not fair!

speaker1: leave her alone! 
speaker2: please! this is the imaginarium! it requires respect, concentration... kindly go elsewhere and take your detritus with you?
speaker3: is he insulting us?

speaker1: oy! 
speaker2: diego!? where's diego?

speaker1: pssst! 
speaker1: ladies and gentlemen, let dr.

speaker3: help me!

speaker1: i c-can't. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: i'm n-not supposed to be here.
speaker2: what am i going to do?
speaker1: that's the p-point. it's up to you.
speaker2: but... don't leave me! don't let me die! but anton has gone.
speaker3: attaboy, sonny. join the men. nothing to it. hup two, hup two...
speaker3: no, wait! that's the wrong choice! that bridge leads to failure and despair. you'll be dead before you're thirty. this is the one. this is the bridge to manhood!

speaker1: he's been kidnapped! they've taken him! it's that weirdo up there! do something, dad, do something! 
speaker2: i want my brother! i want my little brother!
speaker3: you cannot perform here without appropriate authorization.
speaker4: ha,ha! success! one little devil out of the fire... makes it all worthwhile!
speaker3: where did you say you're from?

speaker1: i didn't. 
speaker1: hooplah!
speaker2: diego! where have you been? i've been worried sick!
speaker3: and so... a glimmer of hope... perhaps eternity has not been in vain!...
speaker4: and you can wipe that silly expression off your face, you little poof.
speaker5: you're in big trouble! you're in big trouble!
speaker6: you've upset your mum.
speaker7: he's spoilt our evening.
speaker4: and where's your gamer? he's lost his gamer! another fifty quid down the drain. you're not getting another one! kids! why do we bother?

speaker1: what's the trouble? 
speaker2: ah, the fuzz.
speaker1: what did you say?
speaker2: fuzzy wuzzy was a bear, fuzzy wuzzy had no hair, fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy? the police and the inspector exchange dark looks. clearly they're dealing with a dangerous trouble-maker.
speaker3: next time i find you doing business without a permit i'll impound your wagon.
speaker1: i'll be doing worse than that...now, off!
speaker2: with pleasure.

speaker1: oh! 
speaker1: who's that? who's there?

speaker1: hello parnassus... it's been a while hasn't it? 
speaker2: he's come to collect.
speaker3: i thought so.

speaker1: what can i do?... 
speaker2: nothing.
speaker3: there must be something!
speaker2: you're going to have to tell her.
speaker4: look at that moon. i've n-never seen it so b-big. and the stars...it's so c-clear.
speaker2: rain.
speaker4: valentina?
speaker5: val... val.
speaker4: i c-c-can't call you val, p- parnassus d-doesn't like it.

speaker1: he's not here is he? he's inside getting pissed. 
speaker2: are you happy?
speaker1: ecstatic.
speaker1: hey! that's mine!
speaker1: give it me!
speaker2: would you really be happy in one of those p-places?... n-not me. well... m-maybe....with you. let's run away. make a new life together. i'll retrain. computers. stocks and bonds. we could be happy. just the two of us.
speaker1: anton?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: shut up.
speaker2: why d-do you always have to p- pretend to be so b-brutal?

speaker1: i'm not pretending. anyway... i'm under age. 
speaker2: valentina.
speaker1: i shall be twelve on wednesday.
speaker2: don't be ridiculous.
speaker1: percy? how old will i be on wednesday?
speaker3: twelve.
speaker1: see? parnassus says so too. are you saying he's ridiculous?
speaker2: no...
speaker1: yes you are. i'll tell him.
speaker2: he knows i worship him....
speaker1: he takes advantage.
speaker2: i don't mind. he's extraordinary...
speaker1: puhlease.
speaker2: you are.

speaker1: parnassus is a pain. okay he's extraordinary but i'm not. i don't want to be like him. i want to be like other people. like them. you know... normal. ordinary. you're so lucky. 
speaker1: you know what i mean.
speaker1: actually, i'm going to be sixteen. shall i tell parnassus i know? i think he knows i know. silly man. sweet sixteen.
speaker1: the age of consent.

speaker1: you haven't eaten anything. 
speaker2: valentina...
speaker3: i go to all this trouble and you leave it.
speaker4: i'm not hungry.
speaker3: are you ill?
speaker4: valentina... my miraculous child..
speaker3: now what?
speaker4: i should never have brought you into this rotten world!
speaker3: oh for sake!
speaker4: what was i thinking of!
speaker3: percy liked the soup.
speaker4: why does everybody want to live forever?

speaker1: that's normal isn't it? 
speaker2: immortality's a curse! any fool can tell you that!
speaker1: you know it doesn't agree with you.
speaker2: valentina...
speaker1: and i'll be sixteen on thursday, so let's not have any more tosh about that.
speaker2: listen to me!
speaker1: you think you're so clever and that everybody else is an you can't stop me growing up just by lying about my birthday! it's ridiculous!
speaker2: shut up! shut up and listen to me! listen to me! i need to tell you something, before it's too late!
speaker2: one dark winter's night... many years ago...?
speaker1: is this going to take long?

speaker1: a rider who would challenge the very foundations of the world... 
speaker1: ... the steward woke and remembered his dream. what manner of man had he dreamt of, and what did it signify?

speaker1: ... and as the waters rose... the people's need for stories grew. stories that would feed a great hunger. a hunger for more than just understanding... 
speaker2: what exactly do you do here?
speaker3: we tell the eternal story.
speaker2: oh.... what's that?
speaker3: the story that sustains the universe. the story without which there is nothing.

speaker1: nothing? really. are you telling me that if you stop telling a story... this story... something you made up, a fiction... that the universe ceases to exist? 
speaker2: you make it sound so simple.
speaker1: and you believe it?
speaker1: incredible. it's just incredible to me that you can believe something that can be so easily disproved.
speaker2: i don't think so.
speaker2: no!
speaker3: ..having been brought to the limit of his endurance...
speaker4: ...yet the forces of evil could not prevail, and...
speaker2: stop!

speaker1: there you are. you see. the story's stopped. no more story... and yet, we're still here, the fire's still burning... 
speaker1: it's still snowing. the wind's still blowing. nothing's changed.
speaker1: cheer up... i've freed you from this ridiculous nonsense. mr nick undoes the spell.
speaker1: now you can use your powers to do something else. have fun, travel, learn a foreign language...
speaker2: a sign! a message! that bird was a messenger... from distant places we know not of! other places! the point is, you're wrong! and i'm wrong! it doesn't have to be us here! somewhere in the world, at any given time... someone is telling a story! sustaining the universe!

speaker1: that's why we're still here. you can't stop stories being told somewhere! you can't be everywhere! 
speaker2: a weak hypothesis!
speaker1: yes?
speaker2: i tell you what... you're probably not a betting man but...
speaker1: and so i made a wager with the devil.

speaker1: whichever of us won ten converts first, would win the bet... my argument was the importance of the story, the power of the imagination... his, the power of material things, the supremacy of stuff... naturally... i won. 
speaker1: my prize... ... was ever-lasting life.

speaker1: it seemed as though the devil, after all... had triumphed... and then... one day.... 
speaker1: from the very first moment i saw her, i was head-over-heels in love. she was beautiful, enchanting, delightful, young... but i... i was several thousand years old! how could i woo her? what could i do?

speaker1: don't be a fool! you can't die! you're immortal! you'll just end up broken, in the eternity ward, and i'll be stuck looking after you! forever! 
speaker2: at times like these... the devil is never far away.

speaker1: ...at what price.... 
speaker2: father!...
speaker3: we've stopped.
speaker2: what do you mean `at what price'?

speaker1: it'll wait, it'll wait. another time. something's happened. you'd better go and see. 
speaker2: typical! you insist i listen to a story and then you don't finish it!
speaker1: go and see!

speaker1: incredible! i saw somebody d- dancing in the air.. under the b- bridge.. 
speaker1: it's true! there was a sh-shadow on the water, when the lightning flashed...

speaker1: you see! the d-dancer! 
speaker2: there's someone hanging there!
speaker1: i t-told you!
speaker2: a rope! get a rope!

speaker1: i c-can't reach him. 
speaker2: try again!
speaker3: swing in!
speaker2: hurry up.

speaker1: arghhh!!!! 
speaker2: you've done it! brilliant!
speaker1: argggg!!!
speaker3: come on, don't hang about! we're getting soaked up here!

speaker1: no! that won't work. and anyway, you d-don't know where he's b-been. let me... 
speaker1: he's alive!
speaker2: thank
speaker3: well, he was.
speaker1: what on earth is this?

speaker1: put him in the big trunk. 
speaker2: b-but...
speaker1: don't argue.
speaker3: the boss said leave him.

speaker1: he thought he was dead. 
speaker2: i d-don't like it. it's none of our b-business.
speaker1: so, what do you suggest, we leave him on the side of the road?
speaker3: definitely.

speaker1: hey, you! 
speaker1: i suppose somebody saves your life everyday of the week.

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: too much like routine to bother with a thank you.
speaker1: who are you?
speaker2: percival st. antoine della touraine et sansepolcro da piemonte the third. if that proves too difficult, you may call me percy.
speaker1: where are we?
speaker2: geographically, in the northern hemisphere. socially, on the margins. narratively, with some way to go. and your name is...
speaker1: i... i can't remember.
speaker2: that's handy.
speaker2: any credit cards?
speaker1: what?..oh..ok... you can have whatever you want.. just don't..
speaker2: ...with your name on them.
speaker1: ah...right.. good idea.

speaker1: my wallet... it's gone. nothing. 
speaker2: don't look at us.
speaker3: what's your name?
speaker2: he can't remember.
speaker4: might be for you.
speaker2: they'll know who you are.
speaker2: pity.. i speak russian.
speaker5: i told you to leave him. he was dead.
speaker2: well, we didn't and he isn't.
speaker4: he was hanging under the b-bridge.
speaker6: hanging?

speaker1: by his neck. until dead. if we'd had any sense. 
speaker2: we found these in his p-pockets.
speaker3: the hanged man!
speaker4: is he okay?
speaker4: are you alright?
speaker5: yes... thank you.
speaker4: he tried to kill himself.
speaker2: with his hands t-tied behind his b- back?
speaker1: actually, i saw that trick performed many years ago at....
speaker2: s-somebody was trying to k-kill him.

speaker1: my that's exciting. 
speaker2: we c-can't let him stay with us.
speaker1: why not?
speaker2: we d-don't know what this is about, who he is, what he m-might have done...
speaker3: i haven't done anything. i'm sure. i hope. please... give me the benefit of the doubt.
speaker1: father?
speaker4: these marks... i recognize them.
speaker3: marks?
speaker4: you've been sent by mr nick.
speaker3: mr nick?
speaker4: don't toy with me. tell me you're an emissary from mr nick.

speaker1: tell me you've come with a proposition. tell me what i want to hear! 
speaker2: yes.
speaker3: thank thank thank for that!
speaker1: he's from mr nick.
speaker4: no he's not.
speaker1: he's come with a proposal.
speaker4: no he hasn't.
speaker1: all is not lost.
speaker4: what proposal?
speaker5: father?
speaker1: you're welcome.
speaker2: thank you. percy groans and tears his hair. valentina is pleased. anton is not.

speaker1: we can talk here. sit down, sit down. 
speaker2: thank you.
speaker1: so...

speaker1: i like your study. 
speaker2: the message.
speaker1: the message?
speaker2: the message! what's the message?
speaker1: ah... well... that's the problem...
speaker2: problem? what problem?
speaker1: unfortunately... i've lost my memory.
speaker2: what!?
speaker1: it'll come back. i'm sure.

speaker1: you've lost your memory? 
speaker2: i just... it needs time... to recover.
speaker1: you've come here with a message.... a vitally important message from mister nick... a matter of life or death... and you can't remember what it is!?
speaker2: not at the moment. i'm sorry. it's never happened before.

speaker1: exactly. a laughing stock. 
speaker2: just like the rest of us.
speaker1: i think i'll hide behind this.
speaker2: no face. no name. the mystery thickens. i'm going to have to give you a name...
speaker2: ... until you remember who you are, i dub thee saint george. you can save me from the dragon. george.
speaker3: hold on!.. what dragon?
speaker2: you've met parnassus.
speaker3: now you are making fun of me.
speaker3: i'm sorry but, nobody laughs at me without paying the price....ah,ha.
speaker4: we c-can't do it. we...
speaker2: hi, anton.... what?

speaker1: the show. we c-can't do it. it's your father... 
speaker2: what is it? what's happened?

speaker1: oh no! 
speaker2: can he remember! can you remember?
speaker3: not yet.
speaker2: useless! mr nick sends an emissary and he can't remember! it's a disaster!
speaker1: you can't go on. you're drunk.
speaker2: i am not drunk! i'm under considerable stress.
speaker2: no! no understudy! the audience won't tolerate an understudy! there's only one doctor parnassus, and i am he!

speaker1: somebody make some strong coffee. 
speaker2: strong coffee? brilliant! this is why fate has brought us together. don't worry about remembering... it's all the same to a man on a galloping horse!

speaker1: for one night only... raise your sights... encounter the majesty, the beauty, the miracle that's in each and every one of you. take this opportunity to expand your horizons. it's not too late. experience the imaginarium of the great doctor parnassus. 
speaker2: where's george?
speaker1: p-probably remembered he had a wife or t-two back in russia.

speaker1: thank g-god... n-not a single customer! 
speaker2: let's close up quick while the going's good.
speaker3: he's never not done a show before... maybe he's past it. maybe it's time to retire.
speaker1: oh n-no!

speaker1: oh look! how fascinating. 
speaker1: when does the next show start?
speaker2: there isn't a next show.
speaker2: we've done all the shows we're doing here this evening.
speaker3: but we've got tickets.
speaker4: this man's drunk. dead drunk.
speaker1: disgraceful.
speaker5: he's not drunk. he's got a bad cold....
speaker6: but being a true professional he tried to keep going, at considerable risk to his health.

speaker1: we want our money back. 
speaker2: no problem...dear ladies. no problem at all. i'm so terribly sorry. i can't apologize enough. you can have your money back or, if you like... an extra free ticket. better yet, two extra free tickets if you buy another ticket at half price. this offer is only available today. the women look on the verge of taking up the offer.

speaker1: wow! you took all that? 
speaker2: i got carried away.
speaker3: lying through your t-teeth can do that to you.
speaker1: anton!
speaker2: most of them were coming tomorrow.
speaker3: what tomorrow? we're gone.

speaker1: okay, if it makes you feel better, i'll give it back. 
speaker2: n-no, keep it. thanks to you we can afford to buy valentina a b- birthday cake.
speaker3: that's enough!
speaker1: don't be angry with him. he's a little bit jealous. he's young. insecure. i'll make it my job to boost his confidence.
speaker1: when's your birthday?

speaker1: what do you want? i'll do anything. 
speaker2: i know.
speaker1: you're man's lost his memory! he's hopeless!
speaker2: he's not my man.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: tony shepherd. little toe-rag. he used to run a big charity. i wouldn't trust him. but then... you don't trust me do you?
speaker1: for sake! tell me what you want!
speaker2: i just thought...seeing you so upset last night...that you needed a glimmer of hope...maybe a little bet?
speaker1: on valentina?
speaker2: no?
speaker1: you bastard!
speaker2: first to five?... you might win. and save her. what do you have to lose?
speaker3: i'll kill you!

speaker1: now that would be something. by her birthday then. 
speaker2: what! impossible!..you've seen the business we're doing.
speaker1: things are going to pick up. as sure as eggs is eggs.
speaker2: wait!

speaker1: five souls.. two days, eh!? 
speaker2: shh! i'm trying to think.
speaker1: i told you didn't i?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: that he was a wrong-un.

speaker1: trust in providence, percy. remember the hanging man. the cards don't lie. 
speaker2: no... but they sure as like being economical with the truth.
speaker3: don't talk to me.
speaker4: p-please...i'm sorry about last night. i behaved like an
speaker3: yes.
speaker4: you must admit... even idiots have their qualities.
speaker5: george... we'd like to know who you really are.
speaker6: what?... yes. me too.
speaker5: i may be able to help.
speaker6: really? what?... how...?

speaker1: hold this piece of wire. 
speaker2: you won't feel a thing.
speaker1: i'm going to put the tips of my fingers on the top of your head.
speaker1: i want you to relax and try as far as possible to think of nothing.
speaker3: that's not difficult... in my condition.
speaker1: hold your breath.
speaker1: very good, very good. yes... yes, i see... i see... very interesting.
speaker2: you may breathe normally.
speaker3: what... ?
speaker1: alas, this technique has its limitations.
speaker3: but... did you discover anything?

speaker1: your name. 
speaker2: my name?... what is it?

speaker1: anthony shepherd. 
speaker2: my that's it! you're right! anthony shepherd! they call me tony. tony shepherd! that's who i am!
speaker1: and... you used to do good works. something to do with charity i think.
speaker2: yes...that's right! that's right!
speaker1: it's an ancient technique of mental divination, but i'm very rusty and it doesn't always work satisfactorily.
speaker2: but that's amazing! brilliant! was there anything else?
speaker2: that's absolutely fantastic! thank you. perhaps i'll remember other things.

speaker1: charity work? i knew you were a good person. 
speaker2: so what was he doing dangling under a bridge from his neck?
speaker1: percy!
speaker2: oh dear, was that a rude question?
speaker3: that's so strange. and horrible.. it's a complete blank. but i do remember i was involved in some sort of charity.. trying to do good, to make the world a better place, you know...inspire people, give them hope.... what an arrogant
speaker3: what's that?
speaker4: mozart's flute concerto in g.
speaker3: i mean, the pipe. where did you get it?
speaker4: i found it.
speaker3: it's mine.

speaker1: oh. you're a musician n-now. 
speaker2: it's not a musical instrument. may i have it?... please.
speaker1: are you s-sure it's yours?
speaker2: positive.
speaker1: alright.
speaker1: it's g-gone.
speaker2: don't fool around.
speaker1: ah, there it is.
speaker2: give it to me!
speaker1: oooooh!
speaker3: anton, that's enough.

speaker1: what's eating anton? 
speaker2: he's in love with valentina?
speaker1: in love....?
speaker2: it happens.
speaker1: the little snake! i'll skin him alive!
speaker2: while you're at it, don't forget the other one.
speaker2: the viper, the scorpion, the amnesiac boa constrictor. tony.
speaker1: quite another kettle of fish.
speaker2: really?
speaker3: he's ambitious, energetic... a man of destiny.

speaker1: and he's going to help us win five souls. 
speaker2: i think he might. valentina sees good in him.
speaker1: she'd be better off with anton.
speaker2: perhaps i should offer her hand to whoever helps most in winning the next five souls.
speaker1: that's even worse than the other ideas you've had today.
speaker2: you're not wrong... ah, percy, what would i do without you?
speaker1: get a midget. cut to anton as he moves, thoughtfully, away.

speaker1: what are you doing? please concentrate. we've got a tremendous amount of work to do tonight. a great deal depends on it. 
speaker2: as old as the universe itself, the great doctor, versed in every mystic practice known to man, and many more besides, will guide you to your destiny.
speaker3: what?... hey, what you doing?
speaker2: t-taking you to the heart of your imagination!
speaker3: oh my no way!
speaker2: you won't regret it!

speaker1: go for it sal! 
speaker2: only if she comes with me.
speaker1: now you're talking!
speaker3: n-not at the same time!
speaker2: i'm not going on my own.
speaker3: your imagination is a very special place. doctor parnassus will make it flower.
speaker2: i bet he will.
speaker1: we'll do it together.
speaker3: no. t-two c-competing imaginations in the imaginarium at the same time... it's n-not advisable.
speaker1: eh?
speaker3: the stronger imagination will overcome the weaker and then there's n-no knowing what might happen.

speaker1: that's really stupid. 
speaker2: let go!
speaker3: d-don't be afraid, d-dear lady. you'll be safe with me.
speaker2: put me down!
speaker3: have no fear.
speaker1: she doesn't want to do it on her own!
speaker3: only b-because she d-doesn't realize...
speaker1: let go of her you silly pillock!
speaker4: anton...
speaker3: it's alright! it's alright!

speaker1: sally! they've got her in there! that's her screaming! sal! they doing something to her! sally! help, somebody! help! save her! 
speaker2: father! father!

speaker1: please. everything's alright. it's okay. really. i promise you. a middle aged woman hits him with her handbag. 
speaker1: ladies and gentlemen. ladies and gentlemen....please...

speaker1: better luck next time. 
speaker2: this is my punishment. all is lost. first to five. one down. impossible, valentina. first to five. one down. no people. no time, valentina. we are doomed.
speaker3: ssshhhh... thanks, tony. leave us.

speaker1: do me a favour. take a long walk off a short pier. 
speaker2: can i help?
speaker1: off!
speaker3: l-leave me alone.
speaker2: what were you doing to that girl behind the mirror?

speaker1: what are you suggesting? 
speaker2: oh, c'mon...we all heard her screaming.
speaker1: i was screaming as well. it was t- terrifying...
speaker2: terrifying? why? i don't understand.
speaker1: no, well...you wouldn't. you've n- never been inside the d-doctor's mind have you?
speaker2: your not trying to tell me that mind control stuff is real?
speaker1: you think it's some k-kind of scam, d-don't you?
speaker2: isn't it?
speaker1: no... but i d-don't expect you to g- get it... n-not in a million years.
speaker2: hang on.. if he can really control people's minds, why isn't he ruling the world? why bother with this crappy side show?
speaker1: he d-doesn't want to rule the world d-does he?... he wants the world to rule itself!
speaker2: what a waste... tell me about the mirror. what's the point of that, if not to razzle-dazzle the public?

speaker1: you're way off the mark. it's a b-bloody great mystery... wrapped in a b-brown p-paper b-bag enema...or do i mean, enigma... 
speaker2: er... one more thing....does `first to five' mean anything to you?
speaker1: i thought you were the c-clever one. he walks away into the darkness.

speaker1: if you hadn't been there... 
speaker1: valentina, your father seems in a terrible state. is it the police?
speaker2: i don't know what's wrong with him, but if it's about the show...i don't care. i'm tired of it...let the police arrest us. i'm sick of living like this....
speaker1: don't say that. what you're doing is important. really important. it's just... maybe... it should be done in a different way.
speaker3: what sort of "different" way do you suggest?
speaker1: oh, hello, good morning sir. how are you feeling? that was a nasty bump on the head you got..
speaker3: "different?"
speaker1: well, sir, i've been thinking... it's clear the show's not attracting many people. forgive me but... i see two ways of tackling this problem.

speaker1: either the style of the show is at fault... or the type of audience. i would suggest changing both. 
speaker2: change the show!? who the fizzing do you think you are?......
speaker3: shhh!
speaker1: i'm sorry but.. you're not modern. people want modern. look.
speaker1: this is modern. it works. trust me, i understand this world. this kind of mind control. let's try to meet the public halfway.. the right public.. and in a better part of town.
speaker2: what about the filth?
speaker1: what?
speaker2: the filth. the police.
speaker1: there'll be a better class of police too.
speaker2: that'll be the day.

speaker1: the trick is not to hide. change your colours. be bold. go where they would least expect to find you. i think we have been brought together for a reason. i don't believe in coincidence. you saved my life. now let me do something in return. 
speaker2: our time's nearly up... this could be what we need.
speaker1: this can be my birthday gift to valentina.
speaker3: well then... for sake let's do it!!!
speaker4: yeah, okay, but what exactly do we do?
speaker1: well... first of all, i want you to give me your money. all of it.
speaker3: anton! where are you going? no answer from anton.

speaker1: what are you doing? didn't you do enough damage last night? anton... i'm the one who wants to run away! are you trying to wreck my birthday, or what? 
speaker1: please. we need you.
speaker1: how much money have you got?

speaker1: excuse me, madam. i'm afraid we can't accept this. 
speaker1: we are here to give...not take. we are here to help those in need. if it's money you need, then here it is. if it's the flowering of the soul you need, then here we are but, unfortunately we are booked solid at the moment. but thank you.. i can see you have a generous spirit.
speaker2: excuse me but, how does this work?

speaker1: cost? money is no good in the imaginarium. this is a refuge for hearts in need of truth. a place for souls to be purified. 
speaker2: how long does that take? i'm running late.
speaker1: madam, why should you care about time? what are your dreams worth in minutes?
speaker1: there are hard choices to be made in life. what about the dreams of the less fortunate in the world. do you have time for their dreams? or are you like i once was...do you just despair? despair at all that is wrong in the world.. ...despair at your inability to do anything to change it.. to make it better...i despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that i took the easy way out...the coward's way...i committed suicide! yes, that's right, i killed myself. can you understand my despair? but i was saved...saved by a miracle...the imaginarium...and doctor parnassus. he brought me back from the dead. he gave me a new life. a reason to live. he has given me power to dream again... to dream of a better world.

speaker1: stop pushing!/excuse me, can one make a booking?/are you taking bookings?/stop pushing at the back!/form a queue! 
speaker2: please, i'm sorry but, we're booked solid at the moment.
speaker3: is that child up for adoption?
speaker3: i want to adopt that unfortunate black child. it shouldn't be working like this. it should be in school.
speaker3: who's in charge here?
speaker2: madam, congratulations, you have been chosen.
speaker3: what?
speaker2: come forward and enter the imaginarium.
speaker3: but, i haven't paid.

speaker1: we don't want your money. we want your hopes and dreams. you may make a donation later, if you wish. 
speaker2: but...
speaker1: this is a rare moment. very few are chosen. don't miss this once-in-a- life-time opportunity. this way. please.
speaker1: believe me madam, you're the luckiest woman in the world.
speaker3: alright, i think it's time to move on, folks.

speaker1: ohhh... what bliss... and i don't even know your name... 
speaker2: tony...
speaker1: tony. how dashing.
speaker1: oh, goodness me!
speaker2: if i'm not wrong, i fear you must go alone.
speaker1: why would i want to go without you darling?
speaker2: it's one of the rules... one imagination at a time, free from the influence of another.
speaker1: boring.

speaker1: oh..look... another possibility.. 
speaker1: you must make a choice...and... actually, to be honest, i'd strongly recommend this one.
speaker2: but... rudolph valentino, james dean, princess di?... all these people... they're dead.
speaker1: exactly. to be reborn, first you must die. all of them have achieved a kind of immortality. and we love them all the more for it. they won't get old or fat. they won't get sick or feeble. they are beyond fear. they are forever young. they are gods. and you can join them.
speaker1: there's not a moment to lose.

speaker1: but your sacrifice must be pure. you have to let go of all these worldly goods. 
speaker1: remember nothing is permanent... not even death.

speaker1: ..how do you do this? 
speaker2: hooplah!

speaker1: c'mon..what are you watching that for. 
speaker2: it's him!
speaker3: who are you talking about? impossible.
speaker2: i'm sure.

speaker1: where did he go? 
speaker2: you tell me... it can't be him.
speaker3: so why did he run?

speaker1: there he is!! 
speaker2: hi! hello! today's special! reach for the clouds! discover your true potential! gift certificates are available at...
speaker1: relax...smell the flowers.

speaker1: you thieving scumbag! we break every bone in your body! 
speaker2: no! wait! i can explain! give me a chance!
speaker3: we want our money or you die again! this time for good!
speaker4: stop it! l-leave him alone!

speaker1: stand b-back! i'm warning you! 
speaker2: bending down and picking a flower, he offers it to
speaker3: relax. smell the flowers.

speaker1: mama! mama! help! save us! 
speaker2: did you see me!! i almost reached the clouds! i could have...it was incredible...i was almost there...
speaker3: shut up!
speaker2: i made my choice and i climbed... i felt so much potential. i could have done anything. i have to have another chance...another go...i need this...

speaker1: maybe you were holding them upside down. 
speaker2: what?

speaker1: that cards! the tarot cards! 
speaker2: enough, percy! enough!
speaker3: i made a mistake. a big mistake. i know that and i'm sorry.

speaker1: you're a l-liar. you've been lying to us all along. who are you? who were those thugs? 
speaker2: i am not a liar!
speaker1: no?
speaker2: no! i just... didn't divulge everything i knew.
speaker3: comes to the same thing.
speaker2: absolutely not. not in law.
speaker1: you stole their money.
speaker2: no. i didn't.
speaker1: that's what they said.

speaker1: are you going to believe them before you believe me? 
speaker2: why not?
speaker1: because they're irredeemably bad people, and i'm essentially good. i know that sounds terribly prim and arrogant and self righteous, but i'm trying to be honest. look, the truth is... in order to get my charity off the ground i needed capital.
speaker1: yes, i know, and you're right, but that's the way the grown-up..the real world works. you can't make omelettes without soiling your hands. or should that be the other way round? anyway, i - with hindsight very foolishly - accepted a loan from people who seemed to me, at the time, to be very decent and sincere. there was absolutely no way i could have known that they were part of a ruthless organised crime syndicate and that they wanted to use my charity to launder money. i made a mistake. and i have to live with that. i'm sorry. what more can i say?
speaker3: oh tony.
speaker1: but, can we not talk about me for a moment.. i want to thank the doctor for letting me experience the most sublime, inspiring ....

speaker1: so why were they trying to k-kill you? "again!" is what they said. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: the first time they hung you from the b-bridge... right?... b-because you stole their money.
speaker2: stop saying that! i didn't steal it! i didn't have it. i'd had to invest in infrastructure. i needed more time. when you run a charity you have to give lots of money away. you wouldn't believe the red tape. the charity commission are a bunch of fascists. it's incredible. i mean... c'mon give me a break...i almost died today.. and i said i'm sorry... and anyway..... this was supposed to be a special day...it's valentina's birthday.
speaker2: happy birthday. for a beautiful woman.
speaker1: the marks on your face...
speaker2: marks?
speaker1: they scrawled something on your forehead. symbols... signs...

speaker1: you had some of those when we rescued you. 
speaker2: yes, what's that about?
speaker3: no! leave it! percy sits down.
speaker4: sotto voce to the dr.
speaker5: who is it?
speaker3: it's too late... for visitors.
speaker6: the knock comes again.
speaker1: please can we answer the door? i can't stand not answering the door, or the telephone, or whatever. it's not in my nature. i won't sleep for weeks if we don't answer the door! sorry!

speaker1: i know... it's over....you've won... 
speaker2: four rotten russkies?
speaker1: and the girl..from the pub.
speaker2: sally doesn't count. do you, gal?
speaker1: you're joking... toying with me. like a cat with a mouse... as is your privilege.
speaker2: sal didn't get to make a real choice. you were gaga. out for the count. wouldn't be fair...and you've got four, thanks to your friend tony. so... we're even... it's not quite over.
speaker2: not quite. oh,oh, look at the time...it's 11.

speaker1: father? 
speaker2: valentina... my darling girl. we must do another show! now! quickly!
speaker1: who was that?
speaker2: somebody asking the way. where's tony?
speaker1: i overheard you... he wasn't asking the way.
speaker2: please! get everybody together.
speaker1: i want to know what's going on.
speaker2: not now.
speaker1: yes, now! i want to know the truth!
speaker2: the truth?
speaker1: what are you hiding?
speaker2: there are more important things, at this moment!

speaker1: it's something to do with that rambling story you were telling me the night we found tony isn't it? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: so tell me.
speaker2: what i told you was... the truth. i really am thousands of years old. i have been immortal. i have been mortal. and i have had many dealings with the devil. too many.
speaker1: what are you saying?...
speaker2: remember the woman i was telling you about?.. the one i was so desperately in love with.. so in love that i made a deal with the devil? that was your mother... ...she was so beautiful, so enchanting...so...
speaker2: ... so young. she was everything i had ever dreamed of. i made a choice. i bargained away my immortality. i regained my youth... and i won her. i did! i won her...!
speaker2: ...but at a price...

speaker1: what price? 
speaker2: it's too terrible...
speaker1: tell me...
speaker2: i... the price of my obsession... i can't say it.
speaker1: say it.
speaker2: you.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i was mortal again... on condition that... any children i fathered... would, on their sixteenth birthday... belong to him.
speaker1: him?...
speaker1: but... didn't...
speaker2: your mother never knew. she died before i had to tell her.
speaker1: i don't believe this! it can't be true. it's just another of your wretched stories... a cruel story!
speaker2: if only...

speaker1: why do you say these things? 
speaker2: it's true. every word. but all is not lost.
speaker2: a new wager... the first of five. if i win... you're free... you're mine again.. and we can win!
speaker1: by playing games with the devil!?
speaker2: with one more show. the day isn't over.
speaker1: no!
speaker2: valentina.
speaker1: all my life you've made me play `beauty', `truth', `justice'... filled my head with dreams and high ideals. all that crap! while... all the time...! the devil was right! you're arrogant! vain and arrogant! i'm just another one of your stupid wagers!... you're beneath contempt.
speaker2: valentina! that's not true! it's not like that! wait! come back! valentina!

speaker1: what's happened? 
speaker2: valentina... she's... she's gone... anton rushes out. percy stops by dr. parnassus before he exits.
speaker3: telling the truth... always a bad idea.

speaker1: you fool! you monstrous fool! you should be dead. 
speaker1: what are you doing?

speaker1: saving valentina. 
speaker2: what?... how?
speaker1: i overheard you. you only need one more to win. me! i'll be that one. i'll take the risk to save valentina and, hopefully, you sir. we've still got a few minutes.
speaker2: yes! yes! of course! of course!
speaker1: how about thanking me?
speaker3: what?
speaker1: i expect nothing in return.
speaker3: no. you're a saint... a saint.
speaker1: only valentina's hand in marriage, if she'll have me...
speaker3: oh, my head...
speaker1: and, as your son-in-law... perhaps... initiation into the secrets of the trance.
speaker3: no! i can't do it!

speaker1: but... why not?! what's wrong? 
speaker2: my mind... i can't concentrate...
speaker1: you must do it! you have to do it! it's the only way to save your daughter!
speaker2: i know...
speaker1: concentrate. you must concentrate. i'll make the right choice. i'm sure of it. i can feel how right it is already.
speaker1: oh god!... doctor... we can save her.. you and me. i need this. we both need this. please. the trance. parnassus quiets down. starts mumbling.
speaker1: bugger!
speaker2: it's no good!

speaker1: pull yourself together!... sir. concentrate...or you'll have lost her forever. 
speaker2: tony...oh, tony..
speaker3: it's useless... hopeless... i thought i was strong, but i don't even know how to run away... tony hesitates.. no time! he looks back to parnassus who seems to still be in his trance. hesitates. then rushes to

speaker1: it's alright... it's alright... don't cry. it's going to be alright, believe me. 
speaker2: this stupid theatre...!... that's all i've ever known...! i've always believed it was something precious, but it's not... it's a lie...i hate it!
speaker1: everything's going to be alright... i'll take you away. i'll show you the world. my world. the great big beautiful world i've always dreamed of... you'll love it.

speaker1: yes? 
speaker2: maybe.
speaker1: c'mon then.
speaker3: ah, there you are, tony. here's something m-might interest you. 'missing: d-disgraced head of children's charity'.
speaker1: no!
speaker3: n-not a bad p-picture, tony. listen to this valentina... it's about tony's b-beautiful world..
speaker4: valentina! where are you?
speaker3: ...anthony shepherd, who was arrested last week on charges of...
speaker1: valentina, don't listen to that. i'm innocent. this is the work of people who are trying to destroy me! evil people! believe me! look, i'll show you the truth!

speaker1: hurry! 
speaker2: valentina! forgive me.

speaker1: this isn't right. this is all wrong. which way? 
speaker2: your car is here, mr.tony.
speaker1: ah, lester, just in time.
speaker3: no! tony, don't get in! get away!

speaker1: help! over here! 
speaker2: give me your hand
speaker1: stop! what are you doing! we'll drown!
speaker3: no we won't. this is the way.

speaker1: don't d-do it. don't g-go on. not with him! he's all lies. 
speaker2: just like my father. leave me alone. i don't care anymore. i want a new life.
speaker3: valentina...

speaker1: tony, help me, she's heavy. 
speaker2: what is it now?! can't we just go inside and get dry.
speaker1: you did it! you made the right choice! the light fills the screen and we find...

speaker1: sustainability's great, if you can achieve it. the problem is, in many cases you simply can't, for a whole variety of reasons. 
speaker2: aren't you running the risk of entrenching the need for charity by increasingly institutionalising it?
speaker1: look, charity, like poor little olga... ...is always with us, to coin a phrase...
speaker2: and what's your message to the prime minister?
speaker1: i wouldn't presume to have a 'message' for the prime minister... fortunately for the foundation, i think we pretty much see eye to eye on most things.

speaker1: you look gorgeous, my love. i knew you wouldn't let me down. 
speaker1: this is a vitally important moment for the future of the foundation. the children of the world are depending on us.

speaker1: valentina! 
speaker2: anton!?
speaker1: all of this is false! it's nothing to do with you! it's all him. it's his imagination!
speaker3: call security, somebody.
speaker1: it's all rotten! a naked lie! you've got to understand!
speaker1: look at this...
speaker1: ...`tony liar'..
speaker3: what? how?...
speaker1: 'the disgraced director of the children's charity "suffer the little children, who was arrested last..
speaker3: stop him. silence the little bastard!

speaker1: ...who was arrested last week on charges of involvement in the sale of organs from third world children to wealthy westerners'...unghh! 
speaker2: and now he doesn't stutter! you see!? it was all an act to get cheap sympathy!
speaker3: take your hands off him!! stop it!
speaker2: get off me! what are you doing? you've betrayed me! haven't you? you let him in...into my world, you bitch!?.. after all i've lavished on you...ow!!

speaker1: "we are the world..we are the children..." 
speaker2: my somebody stop him! he's a monster! get him!

speaker1: anton!!! 
speaker2: valentina!..help me. please.
speaker1: forgive me, anton. i was wrong.
speaker2: i know... i'm not a child.
speaker2: i love you, valentina.
speaker1: noooo!
speaker3: who's behind this!? eh!? you didn't come up with this all on your own did you!!!??? no! someone's got at you. someone's paid you!!!... who!!!??? tell me!!!
speaker4: valentina! my darling daughter!

speaker1: you old bastard! this is all your doing! 
speaker2: all my doing?... i'm merely the facilititatater, dear boy.
speaker3: there he is! stop him! leave her alone. get him!
speaker2: i create the opportunities. is it my fault if your not up to it?
speaker4: father! no!
speaker4: no..no no... please.. father..it's all my fault. what have i done?...
speaker5: p-p-p-lease m-mis-s, there's-s n-n-othing y-y-y-you c-can d-d-o, he-he-he's d-d-dead...

speaker1: ...d-dead drunk. 
speaker2: now, there's absolutely no need for that. that's just plain contrariness.

speaker1: you think you deserve punishment but you're a kid - you have no idea...trust me. 
speaker2: ...a selfish everyone i love dies...i'm...
speaker1: ...only fit for hell? if only.
speaker1: no... your pop would never speak to me again. and that'd be a shame. let's dance.
speaker3: valentina!!!!!!
speaker1: damn!... i've won.

speaker1: funny how things work out, isn't it? 
speaker1: it's not what i had in mind y'know... this.. valentina, being the fifth... it doesn't seem right... she's supposed to be the prize, the star prize... not part of the score... and you lumbered with eternal life all over again... what a bummer, eh?
speaker1: i hope they get that bastard. tear him limb from limb... but they won't... he leads a charmed life, that one... i've been trying to nail him for years... i thought i had him this time. but, there's always some prat comes to his rescue... talk about the luck of the devil. those weird markings you found on him... on his forehead... those satanic-symbol, so-called, things... what's all that about?... maybe they protect him in some way... i've never been into that black-magic stuff myself... can't seem to get the hang of it... i know, pathetic isn't it?...

speaker1: i hate to see you like this. look, i tell you what... if you can get the lowdown on those satanic markings, or.. wait.. better still, if you can wipe that self- righteous little creep off the face of the universe... i'll give you valentina back. 
speaker1: how about it?

speaker1: give me that! 
speaker2: give us a moment, please.
speaker2: here's your tube... here's mine. but mine's just a cheap counterfeit... look, it breaks... but here's another...
speaker1: stop!
speaker2: you're not amused?
speaker1: you've been talking to the devil, haven't you? let me guess what he said... if you manage to kill me, he'll release valentina. yes? am i right?... i am aren't i? it's all lies. he can't release her. and why not? because he doesn't have her. he can't have her because she's the prize. he doesn't have five wins. but if you kill me he will, won't he? you'll have lost valentina forever!
speaker2: choose.

speaker1: this is ridiculous! 
speaker2: choose!
speaker1: you've got to believe me! for all our sakes!
speaker3: are you sure you made the right choice?
speaker1: look...
speaker3: let's find out.
speaker1: gotcha!

speaker1: there are three cardinal rules. one, there's no black-magic, only cheap tricks. and... er... i forget the others. now, where's my daughter? 
speaker2: how should i know? you're her father. her loving father.
speaker2: she's free... isn't she?

speaker1: where's my beautiful daughter? where's my darling? how long must i suffer? 
speaker1: no, no, no... no more choices, please... no more choices...!!!
speaker2: hey!
speaker1: percy!
speaker3: about time!
speaker1: where have you been?
speaker3: here!
speaker1: how long have you been here?
speaker3: how long's a piece of string? don't ask daft questions.

speaker1: thank i found you. i need your advice. i've got a problematical choice to make. 
speaker2: problematical my arse! come on... i know it's against the grain...
speaker1: no! suburban bungalows and all that they evoke are anathema to me. dammit percy! stop! i've got my pride!
speaker2: yeah, it goes just before the fall.
speaker2: come on... i know it's against the grain...

speaker1: valentina...? 
speaker2: father...? where have you been?... all these years... i thought you were dead.
speaker1: so did i. but you... i...
speaker2: come in.
speaker3: so far, so good.

speaker1: mummy? can i have some ice-cream? 
speaker2: mummy?
speaker3: billy, this is your grandad. say hello to your grandad. i think he looks a little like you.
speaker3: he's only five. and he's very shy.

speaker1: okay, you look after imogen. 
speaker1: she's eight months, and, so far, fortunately, doesn't look in the least like you.
speaker1: this is all i ever wanted... i know it's not what you wanted for me, but...well... there you go... i'm happy.
speaker2: hello doctor.
speaker1: we're both happy.

speaker1: it's your choice. you can stay here and look after mum and dad, or come with me and help fight the giant. 
speaker2: i'll have to think about it.

speaker1: beautifully made. it'll last for years if properly looked after. 
speaker2: does it come with a happy ending?
speaker1: i'm afraid we can't guarantee that. the camera angles across the table...
