LINDA: sebastian, do you know what time it is? 
SEBASTIAN: you know da vinci never slept. said it was waste of time.
LINDA: what is it this time?

SEBASTIAN: who s that? 
LINDA: not your business. not anymore.
SEBASTIAN: touche.
LINDA: so you calling about anything in particular, or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude?
SEBASTIAN: i cracked the reversion.
LINDA: you cracked it?
SEBASTIAN: look at this.
SEBASTIAN: watch this.
LINDA: you sure?
SEBASTIAN: 91% sure.
LINDA: eleven months with no progress and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue? how?
SEBASTIAN: the usual. coffee and twinkies.
LINDA: i hate you.
SEBASTIAN: i know. you think you could hunt down matt and get to the lab early. i want isabelle prepped for a live test.
LINDA: yeah, i think i can find him. what are you going to do?
SEBASTIAN: well y know. it s daylight in switzerland. i gotta call the nobel committee and tell them to get our prizes ready. see you in a few.
LINDA: hey... come on.
MATT: what?
LINDA: sebastian just called. we gotta get to the lab.
MATT: you didn t tell him i was here, did you?
LINDA: give me some credit, will ya.
MATT: so what s the rush?
LINDA: he cracked reversion.
MATT: wanna ride down?
LINDA: we better take our own cars.
MATT: you re gonna have to tell him about us eventually.
LINDA: i know. it s just you re his best friend. he ll feel betrayed.

MARINE GUARD: morning, sir. 
SEBASTIAN: morning, ed.
MARINE GUARD: your team s in early. something special going on?
SEBASTIAN: sorry, ed. you know the rules.
MARINE GUARD: have a good day, sir.

ELEVATOR: authorization please. 
SEBASTIAN: caine zero zero two seven.
ELEVATOR: authorization verified. good morning, dr. caine.

MATT: isabelle ... 
LINDA: you okay?
MATT: she bit me.
LINDA: yeah. she s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days. linda takes the goggles from matt. linda go take care of that bite. i ll get her.
MATT: and give you a chance to pull ahead? never.

MATT: shh. be vewy, vewy quiet. i m hunting simians. heheheheh. 
LINDA: knock it off. isabelle!
MATT: good shootin , tex.
LINDA: what s that make it?
MATT: i m still ahead. 6 to 5.
LINDA: but i m catching up.

SARAH: can i have a word? 
SEBASTIAN: most normal people say good morning.
SARAH: don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject isabelle?
SEBASTIAN: how many tissue samples have we successfully regressed? hundreds, right? how many have gone on to work on the full system? none.
SARAH: that s beside the point.
SEBASTIAN: no, that is the point. i m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure. this thing works. i know it. i feel it.
SARAH: fine. you can mop up afterward.
SEBASTIAN: you think i m going to kill isabelle?
SARAH: kill? more like liquefy.
SEBASTIAN: sarah, thank you for your opinion, but i m the project leader. understand? she says ...
SARAH: yes, sir.
SEBASTIAN: how did you ever convince me to hire her?
LINDA: you said you wanted the beat vet in the country.
SEBASTIAN: yeah, well she cares more about the animals than the research.
LINDA: maybe that s why she s so good.

A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.: sebastian peers at the vial. 
SEBASTIAN: who da man? you da man.
MATT: as we pull out we see we are.
MATT: protocol is hot.
SEBASTIAN: vitals?
SARAH: normal.

SEBASTIAN: how many times do i have to tell you, frank you aren t i am. 
FRANK: sorry, boss. forgot.
SEBASTIAN: you guys ready to roll?

FRANK: we are live and in color. on your mark. 
SEBASTIAN: okay. roll em.
JANICE: okay. we are rolling record on videos one through twelve.
FRANK: subject isabelle two. currently in phase shift... one hundred twenty six days, eighteen hours.
LINDA: testing de-phase protocol. injecting serial protein caine one two five.
MATT: maybe if you stopped naming them after yourself, you d have better luck.
SEBASTIAN: why thank you, dr. kensington, for that keen scientific observation. i ll be sure to include it in my memoirs.
MATT: a whole mention? and i thought i was just gonna be a footnote.

MATT: okay. 
SEBASTIAN: ready.
LINDA: propped.
MATT: let s make some history.
SEBASTIAN: nice try, sparky.
LINDA: come on, isabelle. you can do this.
SARAH: elevated heartbeat.
JANICE: we re still in the green.
FRANK: confirmed. vitals still in the normal range.

MATT: it s reacting. 
SEBASTIAN: do you see this?
LINDA: it s working. it s actually working.
SARAH: heart rate s up. she s scared. sarah soothes her. sarah it's okay, baby. it's okay.
SEBASTIAN: subject began manifesting almost immediately. protocol is reacting quickly.
LINDA: subject may be in pain or extreme discomfort.
SARAH: goddamnit. blood pressure elevating. brain activity going through the roof.
SEBASTIAN: what? what problem!
SARAH: it s her heart. we can see the heart beating in the ape s
FRANK: i got an erratic heart beat.
SARAH: she s going into cardiac arrest.
LINDA: got the crash cart.
SARAH: we re losing her.
SEBASTIAN: no! it s got to work.
LINDA: clear!
SARAH: we ve got something!
LINDA: come on isabelle. come on. you can do it. you can do it.
SARAH: come on, monkey.
MATT: do it. do it. come on.
SARAH: stabilizing.
FRANK: brain activity returning to normal.
LINDA: welcome back, isabelle.
SEBASTIAN: how is she?
SARAH: i think she s gonna be okay

CARTER: amazing. she's normal, absolutely healthy. if you didn't know any better, you'd think nothing had happened to her. 
MATT: yeah. i can't wait to slice up her brain and trace her neural pathways.
SARAH: screw you, matt.
MATT: well maybe not right away.
LINDA: we should celebrate.
SEBASTIAN: to the finest research team i've ever known.

SEBASTIAN: hey... 
LINDA: i thought you'd gone.
SEBASTIAN: where would i go?
LINDA: a little "i am become death... the shatterer of worlds"?
SEBASTIAN: something like that.
LINDA: since the day i met, all you wanted to do was change the world. she puts her hand on his shoulder. linda listen, i know we've... i mean... well ... i just want you to know how proud i am of you. i know it probably doesn't mean a lot...
SEBASTIAN: actually it does. i guess since you were there from the beginning, you know me better than anyone else on this godforsaken planet.
LINDA: you're positively maudlin. you should be happy. do you have any idea what you've accomplished?
SEBASTIAN: yeah... but i was working so hard, i didn't realize i'd have no one to share it with.
MATT: what was that about?
LINDA: nothing. it's just... he is who he is. sometimes i just have to be reminded.

SEBASTIAN: to successful phase-shift a human being out of quantum sync with the visible universe and then return him safely, with no after affects. 
KRAMER: but now?
SEBASTIAN: but now... but now, we feel we are closer than ever to resolving this issue. we've been experimenting with a new regression formula that looks rather promising.
GENERAL: how long?
SEBASTIAN: sir?
GENERAL: son, as you can imagine, we are very anxious to field test this tactical asset. how long till you resolve this issue?
SEBASTIAN: shouldn't be more than another year, sir. frustrated sighs all around the room. sebastian maybe sooner.
MATT: yo. reality check! what the was that about?
SEBASTIAN: keep your voice down.
MATT: the protocol works. why'd you tell them it didn't?
SEBASTIAN: i wasn't ready for them to know.
MATT: but they're the oversight committee. they're supposed to know.
LINDA: i'm sure he had a reason. you did have a reason, didn't you, sebastian?
SEBASTIAN: i had more than a reason. i had a epiphany. they reach his porsche. sebastian what do you think they'd do if they know we could send a subject into phase shift and pull it back out again? how many seconds would it take for them to take over the whole project, bringing in their soldiers to test the formula on. we'd have lost control of it by the end of the week.
LINDA: it's their money, sebastian. it's going to happen eventually.
SEBASTIAN: i know. but not yet. there's too much for us to learn. i don't want my hands tied by their political agenda when we go to phase three.
MATT: well, then... mind telling us how you're gonna get a human test-subject for phase three without the committee finding out?
SEBASTIAN: that's easy. i've decided to test the procedure ...

SEBASTIAN: ... on myself. 
FRANK: are you nuts?
SEBASTIAN: was jonas salk nuts?
FRANK: yeah. pretty sure he was.
CARTER: and remember, for every jonas salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died.
SEBASTIAN: if we're that unsure, how can we morally justify testing it on someone else?
JANICE: isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway?
SARAH: she's right. we haven't even finished collating the phase two research.
SEBASTIAN: we'll have plenty of time to collate and cross-reference later. monkey data doesn't matter anyway. the only real data is human data.
SARAH: you don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans.
SEBASTIAN: how are we gonna find out? besides, we've succeeded with a gorilla and their dna is 98% the same as humans. and the 2% is not that significant.
LINDA: sebastian ... humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens. gorilla's live in trees. that's a helluva 2% if you ask me.
SEBASTIAN: we're all concerned. i know that. but if we're gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do.
LINDA: why you? why not one of us?
SEBASTIAN: the risks. i couldn't ask...
MATT: what if we volunteer?
LINDA: what if you're too valuable to lose?
SEBASTIAN: i'm project leader. it's my formula and my call. the best way to express your concern is to make sure you do your best work. i'll want about four weeks to...
FRANK: to put your affairs in order?
SEBASTIAN: to run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we'll attempt the phase shift. i'll stay shifted for three days of testing and then we'll perform a quantum regression.
SEBASTIAN: come in.
LINDA: in the past six years, i've never once challenged your decisions, but this ... sebastian. i don't think you should do this.
SEBASTIAN: you don't understand.
LINDA: oh please. how long were we together? you must've said it a million times ... nobody knows who built the lunar lander. all they remember in the first man on the moon. sebastian shrugs and nods. linda but what if something happens to you... what about the project?
SEBASTIAN: lin, trust me... nothing's going to happen.

LINDA: he refuses to listen to reason. 
MATT: can we talk about this later? i'm trying to make love to you.
LINDA: sorry. i just can't let it go.
MATT: i know how you're feeling. hell, he and i've been friends since freshman year.
LINDA: so how can we let him do this?
MATT: what if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on ,mars, would you go?
LINDA: in a heartbeat.
MATT: what if they didn't know whether or not they could get you home? linda thinks about it. it's still tempting. matt this is his chance to be chuck yeager or christopher columbus. well, if i were him i'd do the same thing.
LINDA: let me ask another question.
MATT: is about who gets to be on top?
LINDA: is the human race really ready for what we're doing?
MATT: why do you always get philosophical before we're about to get physical?
LINDA: no really. is it ready? we're barrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that i don't think we can answer.
MATT: they said the same thing about the bomb. they said we'd never survive the nuclear age... but here we are.
LINDA: this night is still young. i mean, when you think about it, it's creepy. do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye?
MATT: we made our deal with the devil years ago. might as well stick around to cash in.

SEBASTIAN: yes? 
MATT: we're ready.
SEBASTIAN: okay.
MATT: it's not too late to back out. i'm happy to take your place.
SEBASTIAN: no. i'm ready.
MATT: nervous?
SEBASTIAN: a little.
MATT: ever tell you the one about superman and wonder woman?
SEBASTIAN: i don't think so.
MATT: so superman's flying around the city, and he's as hell. lo and behold he looks down and sees wonder woman, completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the justice league. i mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle. so superman starts thinking, "man... this is too easy. i could go down there, do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me." after all he is faster than a speeding bullet, right? anyway, he swoops down, takes care of business so quick, you can't even see him. well ... i tell ya. wonder woman looks up, surprised as and says "what the was that." and the invisible man replies "i dunno know, but it sure hurt like hell."
SEBASTIAN: you know, that could be the last joke i ever hear.
MATT: c'mon, man. that's funny
LINDA: o.k. how're you feeling?
LINDA: sebastian takes a deep breath.
SEBASTIAN: fine.
SARAH: pulse 88, bp 140 over 95. a bit elevated.
SEBASTIAN: to be expected.
SARAH: no reason for concern. he's ready.
SEBASTIAN: hey... it's gonna be okay.
LINDA: start recording.
JANICE: we're hot. all systems nominal, houston.
FRANK: okay, kids. let's make some history.
LINDA: subject: male, age 29, weight 166 lbs.
MATT: ready. linda takes the hypo from matt. matt if the tests are any indication it should work quickly.
SEBASTIAN: i'll inject myself. if anything goes wrong, they can't blame you.
LINDA: we can still shut down, sebastian.
MATT: any last words?
SEBASTIAN: yeah. if i'm killed, pretend i said something deep and clever.
LINDA: injection was administered at

SEBASTIAN: nothing so far. 
SARAH: vitals are stable.
LINDA: nothing's happening.
MATT: human dna structure is slightly more complex... it's possible that it may take more time...
LINDA: maybe we overlooked something.
SEBASTIAN: recheck the protocol. it can't be non- reactive.
CARTER: kinda like a firecracker with a bad fuse... sebastian shoots carter a questioning look. carter don't know if it'll go off.
LINDA: frank?
FRANK: no change in bio-electric.
SEBASTIAN: goddammit. another long pause. sebastian concentrates. sebastian okay wait, my arm... it's getting a bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's starting to tingle... excitement overtakes the room. sebastian okay... it's spreading to my back... like, like a fever...
LINDA: here we go.
SEBASTIAN: it's starting to burn... oh it hurts. i didn't think it would hurt.
SARAH: heartbeat's elevated. pulse at 100.

SEBASTIAN: pain! 
SARAH: pulse is 165 ... 170 blood pressure 180 over 100. ...
CARTER: he's going to blow out his heart.
LINDA: prop the crash cart.
MATT: we've got to stop it!
LINDA: we can't!
JANICE: something's happening.
FRANK: listen up! electric activity increasing in all limbs. brainwaves are through the roof.
JANICE: i didn't think the human brain could spike that high.
FRANK: maybe it can't.

SEBASTIAN: no. oh no! stop it! stop it! 
SARAH: pulse is 180 .... holding stable.
CARTER: holy
SARAH: pulse is dropping. 170..
150 .... 160..: there is nothing left of sebastian caine.
LINDA: bio-quantum phase shift occurred at

MATT: is he dead? 
LINDA: no. he passed out from the trauma.
SARAH: vitals returning to normal. pulse 110 ... dropping. blood pressure 130 over

FRANK: electrical activity is stabilizing. 
SARAH: pulse steady at 70.
MATT: un-fucking-believable.
LINDA: you did it, sebastian. you're the first.
CARTER: let's get him into recovery.

MATT: s'okay. you nodded off. 
LINDA: his breathing's hypnotic. how long's it been?
MATT: seventeen hours.
LINDA: where are the others?
MATT: in the lab crunching numbers. we've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research.
LINDA: i keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there.
MATT: he may be coming out of it.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: the lights! turn off the lights! ah christ!
LINDA: your eyelids are transparent.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: so i ... i'm...
LINDA: yes.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: my arms. i can.. where? ... i can feel them...
LINDA: your arms ... your whole body... it worked, sebastian. it worked.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: mirror. i ... i want to see.
MATT: over here in the corner.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i ... it's hard to think.
MATT: it was painful?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: at first... but then everything went black. i couldn't see or hear or feel anything. it was all just black... like i wasn't connected.
LINDA: your system received quite a shock.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: at least my senses are starting to return... you're wearing your shalimar, aren't you?
LINDA: sebastian.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: this is weird. i'm looking through myself at the floor. i'm looking right through myself. i can't tell ... he bumps into a chair. sebastian's voice ... where my body is.
LINDA: sebastian?
MATT: sebastian?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: you really can't see me. can you?
LINDA: gimme symptoms. dizziness, nausea, headache, body-ache, disorientation.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: no, just tired. it's funny. i can see everything... more than before... but i can't see myself.

CARTER: hey. how's he doing? 
LINDA: why don't you ask him?
SARAH: sebastian, how do you feel.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: not to bad, considering.
LINDA: he can't close his eyes so they're sensitive to light.
JANICE: so, what was it like?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: over here.
LINDA: c'mon sebastian. knock it off.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: sorry. couldn't resist.
FRANK: i feel like we're playing marco polo.
MATT: well, i see the procedure hasn't changed your personality.
FRANK: no worries. i'm on it.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: boy, you people have no sense of humor.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: stop there. frank halts the tape. sebastian's voice index that. that was when it started burn. epidermal reaction. 
JANICE: index mark. 112125.
LINDA: it's late. time you got some rest.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: just a little longer.
LINDA: hate to pull rank, but you're my patient now and you need rest. we've got a busy day tomorrow.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: fine.

LINDA: we've set up a thermal camera for observation and i've arranged one of us to be here 24/7 in case you need anything. the team's gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration. if anything goes wrong, we can all be here within... 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: thirty minutes. yes,,_i know. i wrote the procedure.
LINDA: i was trying to be reassuring.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: you like this don't you?
LINDA: what's that?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: being in charge.
LINDA: please. i'm just doing my job.

LINDA: you gonna be okay? 
SARAH: fine. it's not like i have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life.
LINDA: carter'll be in at six to spell you and i'll be in by nine. call me if anything happens, okay?
SARAH: i'm fine. go on ahead.

CARTER: man, i'm tired. that was a long day. 
LINDA: days only get longer from here.

SARAH: dr. caine, report in please! 
SARAH: 

SARAH: i found him later in the lab, running samples. 
LINDA: why didn't you call me?
SARAH: because i wasn't sure. i'm still not. i mean, i could've easily been dreaming.
MATT: it doesn't sound like something sebastian would do.
SARAH: i feel so stupid.
LINDA: i can talk to him.
SARAH: no. i mean... it was probably nothing. i shouldn't've mentioned it.
MATT: you sure?
SARAH: yeah, i'm sure. i mean, y'know, why would he do that, right? just, this place at night can be kinda creepy, y'know.

MATT: so, how was your first night? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: restless. hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes.
MATT: yeah? what'd you do?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: got up a couple of times. knocked about.
MATT: yeah, sarah mentioned you weren't in your cubicle. she said she called you over the intercom and you didn't respond.
SEBASTIAN: i guess i didn't hear. i had the radio on.
MATT: it'd be helpful to us if you'd tell whoever's on duty where you're going to. i mean, if something were to happen, we'd want to know where to find you.
SEBASTIAN: i didn't think it was a problem.
MATT: it isn't. i just don't want it to become one.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: next i want to run a vv and uvf analysis of the platelets.
MATT: we'll have to draw some more blood.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: you okay? 
SARAH: yeah. why?
SEBASTIAN: you just seem a little nervous.
SARAH: no. i...i'm fine. hold still. this might hurt a bit.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: no. i was looking at the clock. why?
SARAH: just felt like someone was staring at me.

LINDA: sebastian? goddamnit. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: you've no idea how much fun i've had. i'm going to hate going back.
LINDA: that's what worries me.?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: how so?
LINDA: what happens when we turn the project over to the army. ever wonder how much fun they're gonna have?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: maybe we won't give it to them. his voice comes from behind her now.
LINDA: stop it, sebastian. it's not funny.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: well, don't do it for me. do it for science.
LINDA: grow up.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: oh well. missed your big chance.
LINDA: got some sleep. big day tomorrow.

LINDA: recording? 
FRANK: recording. subject doctor sebastian caine. currently in phase shift... three days, seven hours.
LINDA: de-phase protocol. injecting serial protein caine one two seven.
SEBASTIAN: not really. i was just starting to enjoy myself.
LINDA: tough.
MATT: okay, man. here we go.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: wait... something... something doesn't feel right.
SARAH: heartbeat elevated.
FRANK: vitals still nominal..

SEBASTIAN: i can't br... br... 
LINDA: what's wrong?
SARAH: he's not breathing.
MATT: subject manifesting.
SARAH: pulse erratic.
LINDA: carter!
MATT: get a tranq. stat.
LINDA: he's reverting. got him on the table.
SARAH: i got no pulse. no pulse.
MATT: start cpr.
CARTER: getting a pulse.
MATT: holy what happened?
LINDA: sebastian... can you hear me? can you hear me? how are his pupils?
MATT: i can't see his pupils!
SARAH: i think he's going into shock.

MATT: just got the tissue sample results. cellular cohesion is stable. 
LINDA: guess so. i was just thinking about the apollo missions. y'know? grissom, white and chaffee... what it was like for them on that launch pad that day, thinking they were gonna reach the stars only to burn to death.
MATT: sometimes the test pilots make history. sometimes the planes crash and people die.
LINDA: but he didn't die, did he? what if we can't bring him back? what then?
MATT: it's just a little hitch is all. he'll be the first to tell that he'll crack it and i'm sure he will. it'll just take time. listen, let's got out of here. we could drive up to the old observatory. we'll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile.
LINDA: no. i want to be here for him.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: hey... 
LINDA: hey...

SEBASTIAN: so i guess it didn't work. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: you look worried. it must've been bad.
LINDA: you almost died.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: well, remember your nietchze. whatever doesn't kill me, makes me stronger.
LINDA: i should be making you feel better. not vice versa.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i guess if i'm going to be stuck this way for awhile, i'd better make some adjustments.
MATT: not too bad.
SEBASTIAN: the latex'll limit the amount of light delivered to my optic nerves.
LINDA: you could almost pass for human.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: well, it gives you a face to talk to at least, and we can all work in normal light again.

SEBASTIAN: the testing's making me sick. 
LINDA: could be the barium or the radiation.
MATT: you're physiology has changed and, well, all bets are off.
SEBASTIAN: i can't believe i have to spend another night here. suppose you're gonna go home now, meet up with that boyfriend of yours now.
LINDA: do you want me to stay?
SEBASTIAN: no. that's okay. it's just, being a guinea pig is more work than i thought. i'll be fine.

CARTER: dr. caine. what's up? 
SEBASTIAN: just stopped by to let you know, i'm going out for a bit.
CARTER: going out? hey wait a sec!
CARTER: what do you mean going out for a bit?
SEBASTIAN: if i don't get out of here, i'm gonna go crazy.
CARTER: but you're not supposed to leave the compound.
SEBASTIAN: why not?
CARTER: that's the rule.
SEBASTIAN: yes, but i made that rule. it's my rule and i'm changing it.
CARTER: you can't just change it.
SEBASTIAN: carter, i was suppose to be like this for three days. three days and i'll be if i'm going to spend the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump. now i'm going out. i'll be back in a couple of hours. okay?
CARTER: 
INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT: carter picks up the phone and dials.
CARTER: yeah, it's carter. we got a problem.

MARINE GUARD: hey, doc. haven't seen you for awhile? 
SEBASTIAN: yeah, well. you know how it in sometimes.
MARINE GUARD: you got that right, sir. i was beginning to worry 'cause your car hadn't moved.
SEBASTIAN: thanks, but everything's cool.

MATT: he could be anywhere. he could be right behind us. 
LINDA: i'll meet you at the lab. i'm gonna swing by his place, just in case.
MATT: see you there.
LINDA: i don't want him to see.
MATT: what a mess.

JANICE: what are the tranqs for? 
LINDA: use your imagination.
JANICE: are you saying he's dangerous?
MATT: we're just saying we need to be cautious.
LINDA: the metro stops running after midnight and he's on foot, so he can't have gotten too far.
CARTER: look, this isn't a monkey we're talking about. it's dr. caine. don't you think you're over reacting?
LINDA: this program is classified. if he's out there it means someone might find out about him. he could destroy the whole program.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: relax, linda. no one's gonna find out.
MATT: where the have you been?
SEBASTIAN: i got a little stir crazy, so i went to my apartment to pick up some stuff.
LINDA: i went to your apartment and i happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up.
SEBASTIAN: what are you talking about?
LINDA: you, of all people how could you?
SEBASTIAN: just what did you see in my apartment?
LINDA: i saw your face and your clothes.
MATT: it was bad enough you left without an escort, but to take off the... out in public?
SEBASTIAN: don't make a mountain out of molehill. i didn't let anyone see me.
LINDA: that's not good enough. when you're outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control. it's just not safe for you to be out there.
SEBASTIAN: come on, linda. you don't expect me to be some kind of prisoner.
LINDA: you volunteered for this, sebastian. you knew going in there could be consequences. for the security of this project, i'm gonna have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound.
SEBASTIAN: i'm still project leader, linda. it's my decision to make.
LINDA: you're right. it's your decision. but if you leave the compound again, i'll notify the oversight committee. then they can make the decision. you understand?
SEBASTIAN: matt?
MATT: sorry, man. you'd do the same if it were the other way around.
LINDA: pack 'em up... everyone go home.

LINDA: hold still. 
LINDA: not enough to worry about.
SEBASTIAN: every day... feels like you're sucking me dry.
LINDA: what are you talking about?
SEBASTIAN: the shoe being on the other foot. you getting to run things.
LINDA: i didn't ask for this, caine. but when a classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night, someone's gotta run the show. look, i know how hard this has been for you.
SEBASTIAN: don't patronize me. and for the record, you've got no idea what it's like. i get up every morning and you people stick needles in me. you bombard me with radiation until i vomit. and then at six it's over for you. you get to go home. but sebastian is still here. sebastian can't leave, or else. that's the worst part, you know. here i have this ... this gift and i can't even use it.
LINDA: now it's a gift?
SEBASTIAN: you're right it's a gift. and if you weren't so short sighted, i'd be out there right now trying to master it.
LINDA: where're you going?
SEBASTIAN: looks like i'm going nowhere.
MATT: come on, man. we've got a ton of tests scheduled today.
SEBASTIAN: do them yourself.

LINDA: want to talk about it? 
SEBASTIAN: no.
LINDA: "we are the hollow men, the stuffed men, headpieces filled with straw."
SEBASTIAN: funny, huh? i've become a literal metaphor.
LINDA: i don't want to fight you. i just want what's best for the program.
SEBASTIAN: i know. and you being right doesn't make it any easier for me.
LINDA: you can be scared. that's okay.
SEBASTIAN: i'm not scared of being stuck this way. with a little more make-up and practice, i could... ... pass. y'know, get by in the world. but the testing...
LINDA: you're talking like you've given up. it's only been a few months.
SEBASTIAN: what if it's years? i don't know how much more testing i can take.

LINDA: that's all we need. 
SEBASTIAN: come on, baby. come on.
MATT: full quantum cascade at 95%. i'm sorry.
SEBASTIAN: you're sorry? you're sorry?
JANICE: i don't blame him.
LINDA: i'll go talk to him.
MATT: leave him alone. he just needs to blow off some steam.

FRANK: yeah? 
SEBASTIAN: i'm going to the lab.
FRANK: don't you sleep?
SEBASTIAN: waste of time. da vinci never slept.
FRANK: okay. i'm here if you need me.

MATT: how'd it go? 
FRANK: quiet. he worked in the lab till about 10:30 and then went to sleep.

SEBASTIAN: ah, my two favorite people. good morning. 
LINDA: good morning.
MATT: why so cheery this morning?
SEBASTIAN: you know some days you just wake up feeling the world is full of potential. like your eyes have been opened.
MATT: i'm happy if i make it to my coffee machine.
LINDA: i restructured the third genome on your radiated protein strand. thought you might want to take look.
SEBASTIAN: cook up a batch and let's see where we go.
LINDA: i thought you'd want to take a look at it.
SEBASTIAN: i trust you. now if you'll excuse me, i need to have my head examined.

LINDA: i'm telling you, i know him. something's going on. 
MATT: think he knows about us.
LINDA: if he knew about us, he'd be angry and that wasn't angry.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: when you were a kid, you ever dream about being invisible? 
CARTER: sure... all the time.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: what did you imagine you'd do?
CARTER: the usual.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: what's the usual?
CARTER: hanging out in the girl's locker room. kicking jimmy margiani's ass.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: jimmy margiani?
CARTER: school drove a red trans am. back then, i was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: ever think up anything along the grand scale?
CARTER: sure. world domination. manipulating stock markets, consolidating a political power base. but those are more recent fantasies.
SEBASTIAN: and what if it weren't fantasy? what if you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences whatsoever. how far would go? i mean... if it were real?
CARTER: i don't know, man. out in the real world... i mean, there's a responsibility...
SEBASTIAN: let's say you saw a woman with amazing would you brush against them?
CARTER: hell, i try and do that now.
SEBASTIAN: human nature. so if you could get away with more, would you do more?
CARTER: i read that in a survey at a major university they asked college students "would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% said yes.
SEBASTIAN: eighty two percent? makes you wonder if the world's ready for what we're doing.
CARTER: so, doc what did you do?
SEBASTIAN: what do you mean?
CARTER: when you were out.
SEBASTIAN: i just walked around. y'know.
CARTER: aw, you just walked around? come on. there's more, right?
SEBASTIAN: like what?
CARTER: man, i'd be walking up to people saying like "this is go,get a haircut." or hanging out in the changing room at victoria's secret.
SEBASTIAN: kind of sophomoric, don't you think. besides, it was late and i wasn't out that long.
CARTER: well, did you see anybody?
SEBASTIAN: there was this one girl.
CARTER: yeah? and did you mess with her?
SEBASTIAN: naw... sebastian gives carter a sly grin. sebastian well maybe a little. i tell you though, a man could get used to it.

SEBASTIAN'S POV: then ... 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: goodnight. linda-jumps. sebastian's voice sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.
LINDA: it's fine. i just didn't know you were there. goodnight.

LINDA: what was it? 
MATT: i don't know. i don't see anything.
CARTER: hello?
LINDA: thanks. no, just checking. 'kay, bye. phew.
MATT: relax... it's nothing. where were we?

SARAH: you awake? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i am now.
SARAH: notice anything unusual last night.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: no. why?
SARAH: franklin three. he's dead.
SEBASTIAN: what of?
SARAH: his neck was broken and his windpipe collapsed.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: how'd that happen?
SARAH: i thought maybe you could tell me.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: sarah... you saying i had something to do with it?
SARAH: he was alive last night when i left and he was dead this morning. and you were the only one down here.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i was in my room all night.

CARTER: that's all twelve hours. 
LINDA: he never left the room.
SARAH: a windpipe doesn't just suddenly collapse. someone or something killed it.
MATT: you saw the tape. the man was in his chamber.
SARAH: then we have a problem, because i the cage was locked from the outside. that means it was opened, the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again. only a human could do that.
CARTER: well, it wasn't me.
MATT: and it wasn't him.
LINDA: are we sure?

SEBASTIAN: any big plans for tonight? 
LINDA: quiet night at home. maybe a book.
SEBASTIAN: really? whatever happened to that guy your were seeing?
LINDA: he's still in the picture. why?
SEBASTIAN: being locked down here, i'm forced to live vicariously. someday you'll have to tell me what he's like.
LINDA: maybe someday i will. see you in the morning.
SEBASTIAN: au domain.

FRANK: pretty clever really. all it does is recycle the signal. he flips this switch, it takes a snapshot and that's all we see. 
LINDA: 
JANICE: and you think he's violent?
SARAH: he killed a dog with his bare hands.
FRANK: dogs aren't people. are we in any danger?
LINDA: either way, we aren't equipped to handle this. we have to inform the committee.
JANICE: what if he doesn't come back?
LINDA: they'll go after him. who has tonight's shift?
JANICE: i do.
LINDA: pretend nothing's wrong. everyone just do what you're doing so he doesn't become suspicious. okay? matt and i'll go tell doctor kramer and we'll lot the committee deal with it.

KRAMER: i'll call general caster right now and convene the oversight committee tomorrow. 
LINDA: thank you, sir.
MATT: what do we do in the meantime?
KRAMER: just sit tight and wait for my call.

MRS. KRAMER: what was that about? 
KRAMER: just a little trouble at work.
MRS. KRAMER: you coming up?
KRAMER: in a minute. i have to make a few calls.

KRAMER: help! help! martha! help! 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: what? no good morning for me? don't you like me anymore?
LINDA: oh, sorry. i...i'm in a hurry.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: that's okay. it's going to be busy day.

LINDA: when did he say held call? 
MATT: he's probably meeting with the committee trying to figure out what to do.
LINDA: i'm gonna call him. linda picks up the phone and dials. linda yes, dr. kramer please. excuse me? when? i'm so sorry.
MATT: what?
LINDA: he's dead. drowned in his pool last night. linda picks up the phone again and dials. linda yes, general thompson please. thank you. as she waits the phone line clicks dead. linda hello? hello?
MATT: let me see that. he tries it too. same result. matt intercom's working, but there doesn't seem to be an outside line.

LINDA: i'll be right back with help. 
ELEVATOR: authorization please.
LINDA: foster one delta eight three five.
ELEVATOR: authorization invalid. request denied.
LINDA: that's a first.
ELEVATOR: authorization please.
LINDA: foster one delta eight three five.
ELEVATOR: authorization invalid. request denied.
MATT: let me try mine.
ELEVATOR: authorization please.
MATT: kensington two romeo one five nine.
ELEVATOR: authorization invalid. request denied.
LINDA: tell me this isn't happening.

LINDA: we've got a problem. 
MATT: how long before anybody starts looking for us?
LINDA: there's no set check in procedure. it could be weeks.
FRANK: already in. it was only a second level encryption.
JANICE: some security system.
FRANK: oh the system is fine. it's just i'm just extraordinary.
MATT: what is it?
FRANK: there's nothing wrong with the system. our codes have been removed.
MATT: removed? by who?
FRANK: here's a clue. only one code remains.
LINDA: whose?
FRANK: dr. sebastian caine.

CARTER: he's not in there. 
LINDA: okay, sebastian. fun's over. tell us where you are.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i'm sorry. but i can't lot you turn me in.
LINDA: sebastian... where are you?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: you have no idea what it's like. the power of it. the freedom. i can't let that go.
LINDA: c'mon sebastian. you're scaring me. tell me where you are and we can talk about it.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: there's nothing to talk about. see ... i've done things that can't be undone.
LINDA: sebastian! sebastian! i want search parties. thermal goggles and tranquilizers.

JANICE: dr. caine? are you in here? dr. caine? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i'm here.

FRANK: doctor caine? 
LINDA: sebastian?
MATT: this is bad.
LINDA: there's something over there.

MATT: what happened? 
LINDA: she was strangled. multiple blows to her head.
MATT: intercom... the phone lines. they're dead.
LINDA: gimme that.
MATT: what the is going on here?
MATT: what?
LINDA: shhh.
FRANK: did you find him?
LINDA: janice is dead.
LINDA: it's clear.
SARAH: the man has checked out of reality.
FRANK: what happened? i don't understand.
CARTER: isn't it obvious? right now, we're the only ones who knows he exists. if he gets rid of us, no one knows and he becomes the most powerful man on earth.
FRANK: but he's not a killer.
LINDA: he wasn't. he is now.
MATT: can you fix the elevator? restore our codes?
FRANK: it'd take hours to crack the encryptions.
MATT: right now that sounds like good news.
CARTER: so what do we do until then. sit around waiting for him to kill us off?
LINDA: no. we find him, before he finds us.

CARTER: you sure this'll work. 
LINDA: we designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping in year one. they were too small for thermal scans.
MATT: systems hot. activating motion detectors.
LINDA: i've got movement in corridor six.
MATT: that's him.

MATT: got 'em. 
LINDA: check. check. her voice echoes from the other unit. linda be careful.
MATT: just watch our backs. hey carter, ready?
CARTER: let's do it.

MATT: if we split up, can we trap him on corridor eight? 
LINDA: if he keeps heading in that direction.
MATT: going thermal.

LINDA: i lost him. matt, i lost him. 
MATT: he probably just stopped moving.
CARTER: it's me.
MATT: do you have anything?
CARTER: nothing.
MATT: how did he get by us?
CARTER: he couldn't.
MATT: sebastian! we're here to help. sebastian.
CARTER: there. behind those pipes. he's not moving.
MATT: c'mon... c'mon...
CARTER: covered.
MATT: what the... he crosses to the heat signature. matt just a vent. just a vent
LINDA: he was there.
MATT: looks like... looks like we're pumping out heat...
LINDA: i got movement again! he's right on top of you!
MATT: no
CARTER: h...help... mmmmphg
MATT: where is he? where the is he?!?
LINDA: right on top of you.

LINDA: what's going on? are you okay? 
MATT: carter's down. hurt bad. bleeding from a head wound.

LINDA: matt, he's coming toward you. 
MATT: 
LINDA: got outta there.

MATT: goddamnit. the doors are closing. he's shutting me in. 
LINDA: he's coming right at you!
MATT: where?
LINDA: twenty, maybe thirty feet.
MATT: goddamnit, i got thermals all over the place. eight, maybe ten of them. must be ghosts.

LINDA: those signatures ... they're coming from the heating vents. 
MATT: i'm starting to lose resolution on my thermals.
LINDA: get out of there!

FRANK: if the room temperature is the same as his body temperature, thermal visors'll be no good. 
LINDA: i'm going!
FRANK: linda...it's not safe.
LINDA: that's why i'm going. corridor eight is clear. get carter to the lab. we'll meet you there.
FRANK: but...
LINDA: do it.

SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: marco...polo... marco... polo... his voice keeps shifting. matt fires. sebastian's voice not even close. 
SEBASTIAN: so... just out of curiosity, how long has my best friend been my ex- girlfriend.
MATT: sebastian. get a hold of yourself. you aren't thinking rationally.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: she's a pretty sweet isn't she?
MATT: calm down, sebastian... we can talk this through. it's not too late.
MATT: c'mon sebastian. don't do this. i'm your friend.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i'm sorry, but i just feel that our friendship is holding me back. i'm sure you understand.

SARAH: this way. 
FRANK: he'll be okay.
SARAH: it's pretty severe. we have to get him to the lab.
FRANK: he's got to be okay.
SARAH: for godsakes, help me.

MATT: he was going to kill me. 
LINDA: i know. he's gone.
MATT: we've got to got out of here.
LINDA: habitats.
MATT: oh that's right between us and the lab.

SARAH: his pulse is faint. 
FRANK: where are you going?
SARAH: this'll hold him but he needs blood.
FRANK: but...
SARAH: supply is right down the hall. i'll be two seconds.
FRANK: sarah, wait for the others
SARAH: if i wait, he'll die. keep pressure on the wound.

MATT: ahh! 
LINDA: he's let the animals out. it wasn't him we were tracking.
MATT: it won't kill me unless it gets infected. you?
LINDA: me .... don't ask about me. if he freed all the animals, we could have dozens running around the lab.
MATT: so he could be anywhere right now.
LINDA: get to the lab, lock the doors and pray to frank can reprogram the elevator.

SARAH: frank? 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: you missed.
SARAH: please no. let me go. oh let me go.

SEBASTIAN: you. 
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i've always liked your feistiness.

FRANK: sarah! sarah! 
LINDA: where is she?
FRANK: she went to the supply room. carter needed blood.
LINDA: i said no one goes anywhere alone.
FRANK: she didn't listen.
LINDA: he's dead.

LINDA: oh sarah! 
FRANK: her too?
LINDA: this didn't happen. this hasn't happened.
MATT: it happened alright. now we have to deal with it.
FRANK: yeah? and just what are we supposed to do now?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: now? now you die.
LINDA: he's here!
MATT: where?
LINDA: sebastian!
LINDA: i don't know if you can understand this, but what you're experiencing is a psychological breakdown. this isn't who you are.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i would say that what i am experiencing is psychological awareness. i like you being in complete and absolute control.
LINDA: you bastard! you bastard. you're gonna pay for this. i'm going to bring you back to visibility and then i'm going throw your in jail.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: you're never gonna bring me back linda. i never want to come back.
LINDA: you!
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: or maybe i'll you. one last time for old times sake.
MATT: don't listen to him. it's not worth it.
FRANK: come on, matt. let's go get the elevator back on-line so we can got out of this hole.
MATT: he does anything, anything at all, come get us. i'll be back to check on you in five.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: imagine you two, carrying on right under my nose. out of curiosity, what did he give you that i couldn't?
LINDA: shut up, sebastian. he's more of a man than you'll ever be.

LINDA:  
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: figured it out? you were always so clever.
LINDA: no!
MATT: get out of here!
LINDA: you won't get away with this. they'll find out about you. they'll hunt you down.
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: the villagers with their torches? lock up your daughters! sorry, lin. it's not gonna happen that way.
LINDA: how can you be so brutal?
SEBASTIAN'S VOICE: i guess because i don't have to look at myself in the mirror anymore remember that first night i was out? i did something bad, just to see if i could get away with it. and when i did, i realized i could have it all. i can kill in broad daylight. and nobody's gonna tell the police they were by a ghost. anything i desire i can make happen, but not if people know.
MATT: i'm dizzy. i can't feel my legs.
LINDA: just keep going. i'll fix you later.

LINDA: matt... matthew. stay with me now. 
MATT: he surprised us. we weren't expecting...
LINDA: shhh. don't talk.

MATT: lin... 
LINDA: you feel that?
MATT: a little...
LINDA: your losing blood, but he didn't hit the vitals. she looks around. linda sutures and thread.

LINDA: goddamnit. 
MATT: what're you doing?
LINDA: this is temporary.
MATT: barely.
LINDA: just keeps getting worse.

MATT: there's no way out. 
LINDA: there's got to be.
MATT: they say freezing to death isn't so bad. you just kinda pass out.
LINDA: matt! matt!

ELEVATOR: authorization please? 
SEBASTIAN: caine. one one one one one.
ELEVATOR: authorization valid. thank you.
LINDA: sebastian!
SEBASTIAN: you said it yourself, lin. i shouldn't hold on to the past.
LINDA: aaaaaaahhhh!
SEBASTIAN: oh
LINDA: you wanna see god? i'll show you
SEBASTIAN: i'm gonna find everyone in your family and kill them-. your sister... she never liked me. i think i'll go after her and her little boy first.

LINDA: nitro... 
MATT: he said it himself... all they'll find is a pile of charred corpses.
LINDA: he's rigged the centrifuge.
MATT: in an enclosed space, he'll wipe out the whole lab.

LINDA: grab on. 
MATT: forget about me. you go.
LINDA: you. give me your hands.

LINDA: climb! 
MATT: but...
LINDA: climb!

MATT: i can't. i'm going to pass out. 
LINDA: keep moving.

LINDA: oh 
MATT: don't look.
LINDA: move!

MATT: it's coming down! 
LINDA: c'mon. before it slips.
MATT: sebastian, you
LINDA: get off me.
MATT: no!
LINDA: let go of me.
SEBASTIAN: remember the day we met? you were wearing a red dress and you were so pretty. now... now look at you.
MATT: get off of her!
SEBASTIAN: you it all up.
LINDA: go to hell.

MARINE GUARD: what happened? 
LINDA: we lived.
