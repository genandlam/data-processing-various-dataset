REX: were you scared? tell me honestly.
WOODY: i was close to being scared that time.
REX: i'm going for fearsome here, but i just don't feel it. i think i'm just coming off as annoying.
WOODY: aach! -- oh, hi, bo.
BO PEEP: i wanted to thank you, woody, for saving my flock.
WOODY: oh, hey - it was nothing.
BO PEEP: whadda ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?

HAMM: moving buddy?! you can't be serious!
REX: well i didn't know we were supposed to have one already.
MR. POTATO HEAD: do we have to hold hands?
WOODY: oh, yeah, you guys think this is a big joke. we've only got one week left before the move. i don't want any toys left behind. a moving buddy -- if you don't have one, get one! alright, next...uh...oh, yes. tuesday night's "plastic corrosion awareness" meeting was, i think, a big success and we want to thank mr. spell for putting that on for us. thank you, mr. spell.

HAMM: what's going on down there? is mom losing her marbles?!
WOODY: well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move. i'm not worried. you shouldn't be worried.
MR. POTATO HEAD: of course woody ain't worried! he's been andy's favorite since kindergarten!
SLINKY: hey, hey! come on, potato head! if woody says it's all right, then, well, darnit, it's good enough for me. woody has never steered us wrong before.
WOODY: c'mon, guys! every christmas and birthday we go through this.
REX: but what if andy gets another dinosaur? a mean one? i just don't think i can take that kind of rejection.
WOODY: hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. this is andy we're talking about.
WOODY: it doesn't matter how much we're played with. what matters is that we're here for andy when he needs us. that's what we're made for. right?
HAMM: pardon me. i hate to break up the staff meeting, but they're here!
WOODY: stay calm, everyone!!
WOODY: uh, meeting adjourned.
HAMM: oh, boy. will ya take a look at all those presents?!
MR. POTATO HEAD: i can't see a thing!

HAMM: yessir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure. 
REX: any dinosaur-shaped ones?
HAMM: ah, for crying out loud, they're all in boxes, you
REX: they're getting bigger.
SLINKY: wait! there's a nice little one over there!
MR. SPELL: spell the word "trashcan."
REX: we're doomed!
WOODY: alright! alright!
WOODY: if i send out the troops, will you all calm down?

HAMM: yeah, alright!!
MR. POTATO HEAD: hey, watch it!
HAMM: sorry there, old spudhead.

WOODY: so did i tell ya? huh? nothing to worry about. 
SLINKY: i knew you were right all along, woody. never doubted you for a second.

SARGENT: wait -- turn that thing back on! 
SARGENT: mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet. andy's opening it...

SARGENT: he's really excited about this one. it's a huge package. oh -- get out -- one of the kids is in the way, i can't see... 
REX: it's a what?! what is it?!!!
REX: oh, no!

HAMM: way to go, rex.
WOODY: no, no! turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
HAMM: eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
WOODY: plus is positive, minus is negative! oh, let me!

WOODY: there. 
SARGENT: juvenile intrusion! repeat!
WOODY: andy's coming, everybody! back to your places. hurry!
MR. POTATO HEAD: where's my ear? who's seen my ear?
REX: outta my way! here i come, here i come --
FRIEND #1: hey, look! his lasers light up.
ANDY: take that, zurg!
FRIEND #2: quick! make a space! this is where the spaceship lands.
ANDY: -- and you press his back and he does a karate-chop action!
MRS. DAVIS: come on down, guys. it's time for games! we've got prizes!
ANDY: oh, yeah!

MR. POTATO HEAD: what is it? 
BO PEEP: can you see it?
SLINKY: what the heck is up there?
REX: woody? who's up there with you?
SLINKY: woody, what are you doing under the bed?
WOODY: uh-h-h-h...nothing! uh, nothing. i'm sure andy was just a little excited, that's all. too much cake and ice cream, i suppose. it's just a mistake.
MR. POTATO HEAD: well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, woody.
REX: have you been replaced?
WOODY: hey! what did i tell you earlier? no one is getting replaced.
WOODY: now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big "andy's room" welcome.

BUZZ: buzz lightyear to star command. come in, star command. 
BUZZ: star command - come in. do you read me? why don't they answer?!!
BUZZ: my ship!!
BUZZ: blast! this'll take weeks to repair!
BUZZ: buzz lightyear mission log. stardate 4072: my ship has run off course en route to sector 12. i've crash landed on a strange planet. the impact must have awoken me from hyper-sleep.
BUZZ: terrain seems a bit unstable...
BUZZ: no read-out yet if the air is breathable... and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere --
ANGLE: BUZZ'S POV THROUGH HIS HELMET: woody's face suddenly pops into view.
WOODY: hello-o-o...

WOODY: aaaaaaah! whoa, hey, whoa, did i frighten you? didn't mean to. sorry. howdy! my name is woody and this is andy's room. that's all i wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. this is my spot, see, the bed here -- 
BUZZ: local law enforcement! it's about time you got here. i'm buzz lightyear, space ranger, universe protection unit. my ship has crash landed here by mistake.
WOODY: yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
BUZZ: i need to repair my turbo boosters. do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
WOODY: well, let's see, we've got double a's --
BUZZ: watch yourself!!
BUZZ: halt! who goes there?!
REX: don't shoot! it's okay! friends!
BUZZ: do you know these life forms?
WOODY: yes. they're andy's toys.
BUZZ: alright, everyone. you're clear to come up.
BUZZ: i am buzz lightyear. i come in peace.
REX: oh, i'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!
BUZZ: why, thank you... now thank you all for your kind welcome.
REX: say! what's that button do?
BUZZ: i'll show you.
BUZZ: buzz lightyear to the rescue!
SLINKY: hey, woody's got something like that. his is a pullstring, only it --
MR. POTATO HEAD: only it sounds like a car ran over it.
HAMM: oh yeah, but not like this one. this is a quality sound system. probably all copper wiring, huh? so, uh, where are you from?
BUZZ: well...no, actually i'm stationed up in the gamma quadrant of sector 4. as a member of the elite universe protection unit of the space ranger corps, i protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil emperor zurg, sworn enemy of the galactic alliance.

MR. POTATO HEAD: oh, really? i'm from playskool. 
REX: and i'm from mattel. well, i'm not actually from mattel, i'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. well, i don't really understand the financials, but...
WOODY: you'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
BO PEEP: well sure, look at him. he's got more gadgets on him then a swiss army knife.
BUZZ: ah, ah, ah, please be careful! you don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
MR. POTATO HEAD: hey, a laser! how come you don't have a laser, woody?
WOODY: it's not a laser! it's a little lightbulb that blinks!
HAMM: what's with him?
MR. POTATO HEAD: laser-envy.
WOODY: all right, that's enough. look, we're all very impressed with andy's new toy --
BUZZ: toy?
WOODY: t-o-y. toy.
BUZZ: excuse me, i think the word you're searching for is space ranger.
WOODY: the word i'm searching for i can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
MR. POTATO HEAD: gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
REX: oh, uh, mr. lightyear? now i'm curious. what does a space ranger actually do?
WOODY: he's not a space ranger! he doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
BUZZ: excuse me. buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out.
HAMM: oh, impressive wingspan. very good!
WOODY: oh, what?!...what?! these are plastic. he can't fly!
BUZZ: they are a terillium-carbonic alloy and i can fly.
WOODY: no, you can't.
BUZZ: yes, i can.
WOODY: you can't!
BUZZ: can!
WOODY: can't! can't! can't!
BUZZ: i tell you, i could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
WOODY: okay then, mr. lightbeer! prove it.
BUZZ: all right, then, i will. stand back everyone!
BUZZ: to infinity and beyond!! ...and leaps off the bed.
BUZZ: can.

REX: whoa! oh, wow! you flew magnificently! 
BO PEEP: i found my moving buddy!
BUZZ: why, thank you. thank you all.
WOODY: that wasn't flying! that was falling with style!
MR. POTATO HEAD: man, the dolls must really go for you! can you teach me that?
SLINKY: heh, heh, heh! golly bob howdy --
WOODY: oh, shut up! in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. they'll see... they'll see.
MONTAGE: song: strange things plays over montage.

WOODY: finally! 
WOODY: hey! who's got my hat?
SHARK: look, i'm woody. howdy, howdy, howdy!
WOODY: ah-hah! ah-hah-hah! give me that!
BUZZ: say there, lizard and stretchy dog. let me show you something. it looks as though i've been accepted into your culture.
SLINKY and REX: wow!
REX: with permanent ink, too!
BUZZ: well, i must get back to repairing my ship. buzz walks away.
BO PEEP: don't let it get to you, woody.
WOODY: uh, let what? i don't -- uh, what do you mean? who?
BO PEEP: i know andy's excited about buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
MR. POTATO HEAD: yeah. like the attic. heh, heh...
WOODY: alright! that's it!
BUZZ: unidirectional bonding strip.
ROBOT: mr. lightyear wants more tape!
WOODY: listen, lightsnack, you stay away from andy. he's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
BUZZ: what are you talking about? where's that bonding strip?!
WOODY: and another thing. stop with this spaceman thing. it's getting on my nerves.
BUZZ: are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command?
WOODY: oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
BUZZ: don't even think about it, cowboy!
WOODY: oh, yeah, tough guy?!
BUZZ: the air isn't toxic.
BUZZ: how dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! my eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
WOODY: you actually think you're the "buzz lightyear?" oh, all this time i thought it was an act! hey, guys! look! it's the real buzz lightyear!
BUZZ: you're mocking me, aren't you?
WOODY: oh, no, no, no... buzz, look! an alien!
BUZZ: where? buzz falls for the trick and turns around.

SID: yessss! ah, ha, ha, ha... 
WOODY: uh-oh.
SLINKY: it's sid!
REX: i thought he was at summer camp!
HAMM: they must have kicked him out early this year.
REX: oh, no! not sid!
SID: ...incoming!
MR. POTATO HEAD: who is it this time?
WOODY: i can't tell. hey, where's lenny?
LENNY: right here, woody.
REX: oh, no. i can't bear to watch one of these again!

WOODY: oh, no...it's a combat carl. 
SID: just stay where you are, corporal! don't move, carl. you'll blow up. i know you're tired! i know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. do you hear me?
BUZZ: what's going on?
WOODY: nothing that concerns you spacemen.
BUZZ: i'd better take a look anyway.
BUZZ: why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
WOODY: that's why. sid.

BUZZ: sure is a hairy fellah. 
WOODY: no! no, that's scud, you

WOODY: that is sid! 
BUZZ: you mean that happy child?
MR. POTATO HEAD: that ain't no happy child.
REX: he tortures toys -- just for fun.
BUZZ: well, then we've got to do something!
BO PEEP: what are you doing?!! get down from there!
BUZZ: i'm going to go teach that boy a lesson.
WOODY: yeah, sure. you go ahead. melt him with your scary laser.
BUZZ: be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous.
LENNY: he's lighting it! he's lighting it!

BUZZ: i could have stopped him. 
WOODY: buzz, i would love to see you try. 'course i'd love to see you as a crater.
BO PEEP: the sooner we move the better.

ANDY: to infinity and beyond! 
MRS. DAVIS: oh, all this packing makes me hungry. what would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, pizza planet?
ANDY: pizza planet?! oh, cool!
MRS. DAVIS: go wash your hands and i'll get molly ready.
ANDY: can i bring some toys?
MRS. DAVIS: you can bring one toy...
ANDY: just one?
WOODY: one toy?
WOODY: will andy pick me?
WOODY: don't count on it?!! doh-h-h-h!

WOODY: buzz!! oh, buzz, buzz lightyear!! buzz lightyear, thank goodness! 
BUZZ: trouble?! where?!
WOODY: down there. just down there. a helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, buzz!
BUZZ: then we've no time to lose!!
BUZZ: i don't see anything!
WOODY: oh, he's there. just, just keep looking.
BUZZ: what kind of a toy -- ?

WOODY: buzz!!! 
SLINKY: i don't see him in the driveway! i think he bounced into sid's yard.
REX: buzz!
RC CAR: whirrr!! whirrrr-whirrrr!!!
REX: hey everyone! rc's trying to say something!
REX: what is it, boy?
RC CAR: whirrr!!! whirrr! whirrrrrr!!
MR. POTATO HEAD: he's sayin' that this was no accident.
TOYS: huh?
BO PEEP: what do you mean?
MR. POTATO HEAD: i mean humpty dumpty was pushed... ...by woody.

WOODY: wait a minute. you -- you don't think i meant to knock buzz out the window, do you potato head? 
MR. POTATO HEAD: that's mr. potato head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
WOODY: now, it was an accident! guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
SLINKY: we believe you, woody. right, rex?
REX: oh, i don't like confrontations.
SARGENT: where is your honor, dirtbag?! you are an absolute disgrace! you don't deserve to -- woody seals the lid back on the bucket.
MR. POTATO HEAD: couldn't handle buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could ya woody? didn't want to face the fact that buzz just might be andy's new favorite toy, so you got rid of him. well, what if andy starts playin' with me more, woody, huh? you gonna knock me outta the window, too?
HAMM: i don't think we should give him the chance.
SARGENT: there he is, men! frag him!
MR. POTATO HEAD: let's string him up by his pull- string!
HAMM: i got dibs on his hat!
BO PEEP: would you boys stop it?!
HAMM: tackle him!
WOODY: no, no, no, no! wait! wait i can explain everything --
MRS. DAVIS: andy, c'mon!
ANDY: okay, mom, be right down. i've got to get buzz.
SARGENT: retreat!
ANDY: mom! do you know where buzz is?
MRS. DAVIS: no, i haven't seen him.
MR. POTATO HEAD: psssst!
MRS. DAVIS: andy! i'm heading out the door.
ANDY: but mom, i can't find him!
MRS. DAVIS: well, honey, just grab some other toy! now c'mon!
ANDY: okay...

ANDY: i couldn't find my buzz. i know i left him right there. 
MRS. DAVIS: honey, i'm sure he's around.

SLINKY: it's too short! we need more monkeys! 
REX: there aren't any more! that's the whole barrel.
REX: buzz! the monkeys aren't working! we're formulating another plan! stay calm! oh, where could he be?

ANDY: can i help pump the gas? 
MRS. DAVIS: sure! i'll even let you drive.
ANDY: yeah?!
MRS. DAVIS: yeah -- when you're sixteen.
WOODY: oh, great. how am i gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
WOODY: buzz!
WOODY: buzz! you're alive! this is great! oh, i'm saved! i'm saved! andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake. huh?
WOODY: right? buddy?
BUZZ: i just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
WOODY: oh. oh, that's good.
BUZZ: but we're not on my planet, are we?
WOODY: no.

WOODY: ok! come on! you want a piece of me?! 
WOODY: owwwww!!!
SFX: CAR DOOR SLAM: the toys stop fighting. before they can react...
MRS. DAVIS: next stop...
ANDY: pizza planet! yeah!!!
WOODY: andy?!
WOODY: doesn't he realize that i'm not there? i'm lost! oh, i'm a lost toy!
BUZZ: buzz lightyear mission log. the local sheriff and i seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort --
WOODY: you!

A GIGANTIC TIRE: stops just millimeters from woody's nose. 
BUZZ: according to my nava-computer, the --
WOODY: shut up! just shut up, you idiot!!
BUZZ: sheriff, this is no time to panic.
WOODY: this is the perfect time to panic! i'm lost, andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
BUZZ: my fault?! if you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
WOODY: oh, yeah? well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
BUZZ: don't talk to me about importance. because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
BUZZ: right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, emperor zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet. i alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. and you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with star command.
WOODY: you are a toy!!! you aren't the real buzz lightyear, you're an action figure!! you are a child's plaything!!!
BUZZ: you are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. farewell.
WOODY: oh, yeah? well, good riddance, ya looney!
WOODY: rendez-vous with star command.

PIZZA DELIVERER: hey, gas dude!

WOODY: buzz! buzz, come back!
BUZZ: go away.

WOODY: no, buzz, you've gotta come back. i found a spaceship! 
WOODY: it's a spaceship, buzz!

PIZZA DELIVERER: c'mon, man, hurry up. um, like the pizza's are getting cold here. 
BUZZ: now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
WOODY: uh-huh. and when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
BUZZ: well, then let's climb abroad.
WOODY: no, no, no, wait, buzz, buzz, let's get in the back. no one will see us there.
BUZZ: negative. there are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. we'll be much safer in the cockpit.
WOODY: yeah, but, buzz! buzz!
PIZZA DELIVERER: ok, so that's two lefts, and then a right, huh?
ATTENDANT: yeah.
PIZZA DELIVERER: okay, thanks for the directions.
WOODY: buzz!

A LARGE TOOL BOX: barreling towards him.

ROBOT GUARDS: you are clear to enter. welcome to pizza planet. 
MALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER: next shuttle lift-off scheduled for t-minus 30 minutes and counting...
FEMALE VOICE OVER SPEAKER: the white zone is for eating pizza only. the white zone is for...
BUZZ: sheriff!
BUZZ: sheriff?
BUZZ: there you are. now the entrance is heavily guarded. we need a way to get inside.
BUZZ: great idea, woody! i like your thinking!

WOODY: ow! watch where you're going! 
BUZZ: sorry.

BUZZ: what a space port. good work, woody. 
ANDY: mom, can i play black hole? please, please, please?!
ANDY: standing with mom and molly in her stroller.
WOODY: andy!
MRS. DAVIS: what's black hole?
ANDY: oh, it's so cool...
BUZZ: now we need to find a ship that's headed for sector 12 --
WOODY: wait a minute! no buzz! this way! there's a special ship. i just saw it!
BUZZ: you mean it has hyperdrive?
WOODY: hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
WOODY: c'mon, c'mon, that's it...
BUZZ: where is it? i don't see the -- buzz stops short at the sight of...

BUZZ: spaceship. 
WOODY: alright buzz, get ready...
WOODY: okay, buzz, when i say "go," we're gonna jump in the basket --
WOODY: buzz!
WOODY: dooh! no! this cannot be happening to me!!

ALIEN #1: a stranger!

BUZZ: who's in charge here?
ALIENS: the cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!
ANGLE: CRANE GAME CLAW: it dangles directly above the toys.
ALIEN #1: the claw is our master.
ALIEN #2: the claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
WOODY: this is ludicrous.

SID'S MOM: sid!! your pop-tarts are ready!

BUZZ: are you alright? i'm proud of you, sheriff. a lesser man would have talked under such torture.
WOODY: i sure hope this isn't permanent.

SFX: THUNDERCLAP: a flash of lightning interrupts the moment.
SID: oh, no...
SID: aw, man...!
SID: sid phillips reporting. launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site. tomorrow's forecast... sid smacks buzz down on the desk, winds his alarm clock, and places it next to buzz.
SID: sunny. ha-ha-ha. sweet dreams.

MRS. DAVIS: i looked everywhere, honey, but all i could find was your hat.

BUZZ: i can't help. i can't help anyone.
WOODY: why, sure you can, buzz. you can get me out of here and then i'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for andy's house.
BUZZ: andy's house. sid's house. what's the difference.
WOODY: oh, buzz, you've had a big fall.
BUZZ: no, woody, for the first time i am thinking clearly. you were right all along. i'm not a space ranger. i'm just a toy. a stupid little insignificant toy.
WOODY: whoa, hey -- wait a minute. being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger.
BUZZ: yeah, right.
WOODY: no, it is. look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a space ranger, pal, it's because you're a toy! you are his toy.
BUZZ: but why would andy want me?
WOODY: why would andy want you?! look at you! you're a buzz lightyear. any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. you've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a cool toy.
WOODY: as a matter of fact you're too cool. i mean -- i mean what chance does a toy like me have against a buzz lightyear action figure? all i can do is...
WOODY: there's a snake in my boots!
WOODY: why would andy ever want to play with me, when he's got you? i'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.

WOODY: buzz!! what are you doing? i thought you were -- 
BUZZ: come on, sheriff. there's a kid over in that house who needs us.
WOODY: yes sir!
WOODY: come on, buzz! we can do it!

A MOVING TRUCK: can be seen pulling up in front of andy's house.

WOODY: who are you callin' busted, buster?!
WOODY: that's right. i'm talking to you, sid phillips. we don't like being blown up, sid, or smashed, or ripped apart... while woody's voice box talks, sid checks the pullstring.
