speaker1: good evening, sir. 
speaker2: yes. this way.
speaker3: welcome, gentlemen. youã­re early. here for the examination, right?
speaker2: the handiwork of an extremely sick individual.
speaker2: youã­ve read the reports. not much to go on. we know nothing about him, except that he likes to cut them... always the same type of blade. forensics match in each case... anyway, it's all in the reports, read them for yourself.
speaker2: why are you wearing that thing on your face?
speaker1: germs, sir. these places are full of them.
speaker2: i see. one thingã­s for sure, heã­s ambitious.
speaker3: you can say that again.
speaker1: what about thompson, sir? wasnã­t this his case?
speaker2: thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some thing. anyway he isnã­t with us any longer. the case is yours. go through his files. take what you need. by the way, howã­s your mother?
speaker1: sheã­s getting better, thanks. she... stromboli very good...

speaker2: fifty-six... fifty-six...

speaker1: what? who are you? 
speaker2: cã­mon, letã­s go! we donã­t have any time.
speaker1: hold it a minute. letã­s start at the beginning, huh?
speaker3: quick! run!
speaker4: each passageway completely deserted.
speaker1: 

speaker1:  
speaker2: sorry, sir.
speaker1: donã­t ever sneak up on me like that!
speaker2: patricia crenshaw.
speaker2: iã­m your new assistant.
speaker1: i didnã­t requisition a secretary.
speaker2: the chief-inspector thought you might need a hand. bumstead oh.
speaker2: iã­ve taken the liberty and had inspector thompsonã­s office searched, as i believe you instructed. all clear now, sir. they found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories...
speaker1: good.
speaker2: you wonã­t regret this, sir.
speaker1: fine.

speaker1: keep newspapers here, birth certificates, records of deaths, that kind of thing? 
speaker2: which would you like
speaker2: are you alright? he looks around - restrained panic. white sure. iã­m fine. librarian mmm-hmm. stairs at the end of the hall. third floor. turn left. section c-7. row 35, near the toilets.
speaker2: donã­t mention it...

speaker1: iã­m trying to reach nine zero eight triple two. i canã­t get through... what?!... 
speaker1: it is?... which area is that number listed in?... is that near the ocean?... the

speaker1: coffee? 
speaker2: what? i donã­t drink coffee. a cup of tea would be good. milk and no sugar.
speaker3: making progress?
speaker2: these are the investigations of a madman. he has fabricated an entire bizarre paranoid delusion with no internal logic whatever. this is a mess. a horrible mess. itã­s the second time now.
speaker2: look at this!
speaker2: you typed this report?
speaker4: yes, sir. anything wrong?
speaker2: wrong? look at this!
speaker4: it seems fine.

speaker1: iã­m sorry... 
speaker2: do you wash your hands before you type things?
speaker1: why, yes.
speaker2: well be more careful, please.

speaker1: inspector bumsteadã­s office... yes... yes... 
speaker2: yes, sir. the chief-inspector said he would see you now.

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: a formality. i need to speak with thompson. officially i need your written permission.
speaker1: why do you want to speak to him?
speaker2: a hunch. he might be able to... stromboli bumstead, donã­t be so paranoid.
speaker2: itã­s extremely important to my investigation...
speaker1: iã­ll be the judge of that. anything else?
speaker2: actually, i was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me... stromboli o.s. absolutely not. up to my ears in cases right now - canã­t spare anyone.
speaker2: lost something?
speaker1: what makes you think that! if you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked - you might get things done faster, bumstead...

speaker1: i need something to keep me awake. 
speaker2: looks like you need a haircut to me.
speaker1: thanks. just some pills.
speaker2: only two bucks. shave as well... white your sign says you sell drugs - well, iã­m here to buy some. okay?
speaker2: relax. sure!

speaker2: mnunn. cold lately. that night, couple weeks ago. that was
speaker2: yeah, iã­m like that. senility says the wife. but she sure canã­t complain. heh. the erector set still works good. and this ainã­t no rug! gã­head. feel it! all mine!
speaker3: yes! feeeeel it!

speaker1: beware! the night is deadly. there is a criminal among us. white looks forward. 
speaker1: it could be she! the innocent across the street!
speaker1: or the temptress next door!
speaker1: or mister nervy stranger at the back!
speaker1: you are thinking it could be anyone? and youã­re right! why, it could even be mother!
speaker2: he took my little boy! iã­ll rip out his eyes! inside - white breaths relief.

speaker1: you have sinned? 
speaker2: no. ah...
speaker3: i am listening. white thereã­s a... woman. i don't know but i think i, ahh...
speaker3: you fornicated?
speaker2: no. i, ah...
speaker3: you seem restless.
speaker2: someoneã­s after me.
speaker3: then we must call the police.
speaker2: no. i mean... that isnã­t necessary.
speaker3: i see. then who is after you? what sins have you committed?
speaker2: just let me sit here for a moment? iã­ll go soon, and stop bothering you.
speaker3: youã­re the murderer? yes! that must be it! donã­t kill me!
speaker2: shut up! listen. walk out quietly. understand?
speaker3: donã­t kill me!
speaker2: shut up!
speaker3: please...

speaker1: how long have you been here? 
speaker2: maybe ten minutes... thatã­s strange.
speaker1: spinning backwards?
speaker2: yours too?
speaker1: i want prints over here...

speaker1: i want to see the doctor. it's important. 
speaker2: what time was your appointment? white look! tell him i'm here.

speaker1: it has failed. 
speaker2: this is becoming dangerous, yes!
speaker3: let's get this over with.
speaker4: what about the dance-steps! this is my responsibility, we must resolve this issue, yes?
speaker4: sorry.
speaker3: the situation has changed. this one is in possession of knowledge... man 1 ...to avoid influence, yes.
speaker5: a freak!
speaker1: impossible!
speaker3: it gets interesting, yes.
speaker2: stop this! it has gone too far! tell mister black!

speaker1: you remember nothing? who you are? 
speaker2: you know something about me?
speaker1: ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? is there nothing
speaker1: water?
speaker2: waves... a beach. a woman whispering. that's all. i need to stay awake. do you have any pills?
speaker1: what does she say? the woman.
speaker2: asks my name. over and over. just like a broken record. only thing is, i can't answer. i've no idea what my name
speaker2: that's what people keep telling me.
speaker1: bad dreams?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: tell me about them... white yeah well, why don't i ask some questions for a change.
speaker1: if you like.
speaker2: you're supposed to be my doctor, right?
speaker1: that's right. i
speaker1: well... white am i a killer?
speaker1: i cannot say... you don't know the answer to that?
speaker2: i told you, i can't remember a thing!
speaker1: we won't get anywhere like this. please. let's take things in easy steps...

speaker1: put simply... a penetration of the left parieto-occipital area of the cranium... complicated by inflammation that resulted in adhesions of the brain to the meninges. without going into detail... the formation of scar tissue altered the configuration of the lateral ventricles, producing incipient atrophy of the medulla... white look. it was a simple question. can someone kill and not remember it? schreber i'm sorry. i get carried away sometimes. possible? i'm... ah, afraid so. 
speaker2: did she drown? the woman you told me about?
speaker1: not exactly. she was found in a canal, disembowelled. throat cut. blood drained. the body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
speaker2: horrible...
speaker1: you remember nothing, eh? let me show you something.
speaker1: formation of memories is the most important of brain functions.

speaker1: we are little more than a sum of memories. from them we reference who we are, where we're going. without a past we are nothing. this is why you are so interesting. 
speaker2: i'm nothing then.
speaker1: anything
speaker2: can i get my life back?
speaker1: maybe.
speaker1: we know of two kinds of memory. firstly, declarative memory.
speaker1: and then there is procedural memory.
speaker1: follow?
speaker1: research on simple animals can be... useful. to show us where memory storing systems are located, for example. i am building an experiment with hamsters next. cute little things.
speaker1: listen to me talk! you must be hungry.

speaker1: i'm sorry. about before. 
speaker2: i don't blame you for getting angry. you are in a frustrating situation. you must be patient though. trust me completely. i'm here to help.
speaker2: it can't wait?
speaker1: still kicking, huh?

speaker1: how are things in here? 
speaker2: ah, nearly done. so tell me about your dreams. i'm very interested.
speaker3: just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind. you know, chased by mysterious men in black, that kind of thing...
speaker2: ah, our friends in black... they are not just a figment of your imagination you know, in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real.
speaker2: i know everything about you. you have no choice but to trust me.
speaker2: scarey, isn't it? white startles awake.
speaker2: are you feeling alright?
speaker2: what are you doing?
speaker3: i have to go...
speaker2: you can't go yet. we've got so much to talk about...
speaker2: you're tired. you need to lie down.
speaker3: those pills...

speaker1: this is madness. if we're caught... 
speaker2: shut-up. help me with these straps...

speaker1: leave it! 
speaker1: whoever it is - get rid of them!
speaker2: keys.
speaker1: i'm sorry i had to put you through this, anton. there will be some pain, but things will be easier this way.

speaker1: hold it! 
speaker1: police. nobody move.
speaker2: he tried to kill me!
speaker1: shut up! everybody stay calm...
speaker1: what's that?

speaker1: i'm curious? how many so far? he shakes his watch, puts it to his ear. white what? i... bumstead let's see, there's the little guy with no arms or legs. and the young boy? white young boy? 
speaker1: the six year old. sure, you remember.
speaker1: you sure have demonstrated a great deal of... imagination. the baby was the best though. several cops lost their lunch over that one. head twisted off, spine pulled out, yeech... white stop it. you're making me sick...
speaker1: we count seven so far. anyone we missed?
speaker2: inspector bumstead... inspector...
speaker1: what is it, crenshaw?
speaker3: just reminding you... your eight pee em...
speaker1: dammit. very efficient, as usual, crenshaw. remind me to give you my watch. it needs fixing.
speaker3: yes sir.
speaker4: where are we going?
speaker1: shut-up.
speaker1: gesundheit! white i didn't sneeze.

speaker1: what are we doing here? 
speaker2: get out.

speaker1: left - profile. 
speaker1: right - profile.
speaker1: move - forward.
speaker2: move - forward.
speaker2: watch - the - wheel.
speaker2: move - forward.
speaker2: stand - behind - the - screen.
speaker2: move - forward.
speaker2: face - the - wall.

speaker1: what's your name? white i don't remember. 
speaker1: oh, no?

speaker1: john... 
speaker1: ...murderer.
speaker1: you'll sign a confession?

speaker1: please, stay calm. white this man wants to kill me. the guard remains indifferent. schreber just one of his many delusions - it's nothing. shut up! listen, you! this is a fortunate coincidence - we won't get another chance like this. listen to me. white what do you want? 
speaker1: you're innocent... you didn't kill anyone. white what am i doing in

speaker1: what's he doing here? 
speaker2: says he is the man's doctor... you know...
speaker1: i

speaker1: the men in black - they're the killers. 
speaker2: you're a liar!
speaker1: no, it's the truth.
speaker2: so you're telling me the truth
speaker2: not that again...
speaker1: everyone get's one - very much like this... but this one's special. it will help you understand, everything... white i'm not injecting anything into my brain.
speaker1: anton - i mean, john, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment. i arranged it. it was a lie from the beginning. it almost worked, but things did not go as they should have. you have been left - blank.
speaker1: you can change this,
speaker1: please! don't be foolish! time is short. let me show you something.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: don't ask stupid questions. look at it.
speaker1: concentrate. imagine the syringe rising. picture it floating above the table.

speaker1: it's a trick. 
speaker2: no it isn't.

speaker1: doctor! what brings you here? 
speaker2: just visiting my patient.
speaker1: really? and how is his state of mind?
speaker2: he's seriously disturbed...
speaker1: you seem a little edgy. everything okay?
speaker2: yes, of course. everything's fine...
speaker1: to tell you the truth, i'm glad we've run into each other like this. maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
speaker2: loose ends?
speaker3: bumstead!
speaker4: i need to speak to you. immediately.

speaker1: bumstead, these... er, gentlemen are here to collect white. 
speaker2: this is highly irregular. i have a right to know.
speaker3: we are from a mental asylum.
speaker1: yes. that's right. he's ill - he needs expert help.
speaker2: i see...
speaker3: yes, inspector. has he been displaying any strange... behaviour?
speaker2: he's been a little angel...
speaker1: if you could show them to the holding cell now.

speaker1: yes, sir. i'm sorry... but i don't understand how it was possible. the only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed... 
speaker2: shouts at cringing
speaker3: how could you have been so stupid?

speaker1: i'm sorry, sir. 
speaker2: alright, get out.
speaker2: you stay.
speaker2: bumstead, you're starting to annoy me. this case is very important to me. just a little warning: i've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
speaker3: yes, sir.

speaker1: ...earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended. 
speaker1: ...and now for a message from lump-o food products...

speaker1: that's me. i'm a shadow. 
speaker1: do i look like a murderer to you?
speaker2: yes?... who is this?... who's there?...

speaker1: please believe me. it's 
speaker2: it's the truth... i need you. i know you're innocent.
speaker3: how do you know i'm innocent?
speaker2: of course you are. you couldn't do those terrible things. come home with me - maybe things will make sense then...
speaker3: i can't do that. it's dangerous. what about my parents? do you know where i can find them?
speaker2: they're dead, john.
speaker2: you have an uncle. you were very close.
speaker2: this is where he lives. i'm sure he would like to see you. white thanks. wife don't you want me? my body? remember how my skin feels? touch it. i... she notices sachiko - becomes self-conscious. sachiko
speaker3: what's your name?

speaker1: i want to help... 
speaker2: alright. here...
speaker2: know this place? she looks at the card. elizabeth of course. your home town - where you grew up...
speaker2: how do i get there? tell me.
speaker3: that's easy. you...
speaker1: ...strange, i forgot.
speaker2: yes.

speaker1: bumstead, back turned, glancing at his watch. 
speaker2: go away!
speaker3: open up, thompson. it's me...
speaker2: bumstead?
speaker2: can't let you in... sorry.
speaker4: i'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
speaker2: not that. anything else.
speaker4: you don't look so well... c'mon, let me in thompson.
speaker2: i can't talk about
speaker2: they've taken my mind, my memories...
speaker4: what? who has?
speaker2: is that your idea of a joke? i don't remember... take my advice, bumstead. get off this case. now.
speaker4: what is going on? thompson wish i could tell you, bumstead.
speaker2: it's - it's disgusting, i know...
speaker4: we have to get you to a doctor...
speaker2: no... no doctor...
speaker4: but... how long has this been happening?
speaker2: a few days... a few weeks - dunno, i can't remember. worse thing is, i never know if it will change back again... now, please leave me alone.

speaker1: we have located him. now is the time, yes. 
speaker1: let the tuning commence!

speaker1: all the same entry wounds. it's definitely him. she lives... lived here. a prostitute. 
speaker2: the other one?
speaker1: his wife.
speaker2: small world. where's the photographer?
speaker1: no one available.
speaker3: they won't come out.
speaker1: we'll interrogate them anyway.
speaker1: this is the family of the victim - apparently they were in the apartment when he committed... bumstead what are you talking about?
speaker1: oh, yes...
speaker1: they don't speak english...
speaker2: how will we interrogate them?
speaker1: well, sir... i don't know exactly.
speaker2: it's alright. i won't hurt you.

speaker1: i have called this meeting for a purpose, yes? it is clear to you we are - unhappy, yes? 
speaker2: yes, of course. i...
speaker1: the tuning failed - when our agents arrived he was gone. he
speaker1: no excuses, dearest doctor! answers. yes? mystery men answers! answers!
speaker1: you said this would be containable! nothing works this time. why is this so?
speaker3: why! why!
speaker2: i - ah - i... it's a little cold in here don't you think?
speaker1: we must find him. this is your responsibility. schreber yes, of course...

speaker1: who is it? 
speaker2: won't say. says he must talk to you.
speaker1: put it through...
speaker1: this is bumstead. who is this?

speaker1: i need everything on the jonathan white case. 
speaker2: yes, sir.
speaker1: please - i'm in a hurry. miss crenshaw certainly.

speaker1: why give yourself up? 
speaker2: i - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. i thought maybe you know something... i'm scared.
speaker1: that was a pretty good escape act at the station. how did you do that?
speaker2: i woke up in a subway. i don't know how i got there. bumstead uh-huh. what are you scared of?
speaker2: people... after me.
speaker1: who?
speaker2: i don't know who they are.
speaker1: why are they after you?
speaker2: don't know that either.
speaker1: don't know much, do you?

speaker1: you have duplicated the personality, yes. 
speaker2: it is ready. the doctor was most helpful.
speaker1: i hear a clock in my head, and i like it! men we hear clocks in our heads, and we like it!
speaker1: a world in our likeness!
speaker3: a world in our likeness!

speaker1: please. not that way. if you could just follow the covering - the carpet gets stained and it's impossible to clean. 
speaker1: everything the department knows about john white is in this. here. excuse me for a moment.

speaker1: that stuff helpful? white i suppose... why are you helping me? 
speaker1: you're case has been driving me crazy. you see, i pride myself on being thorough. there's too many loose ends with your case. thought it was best you were hidden until we understand more about the facts. what do you know about these men in black?
speaker2: if you shoot them here... you can kill them. they're not people - like us - got insects in their heads... got any disinfectant?
speaker1: here. careful with your trousers. that stuff stains.
speaker1: here.
speaker1: any idea what part the doctor plays in this business?
speaker1: let's try and find out, shall we. lace is untied.

speaker1: i didn't tell you the entire reason i helped you. it started with two little girls. twins. used to play with them when i was young. couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then i understood why... 
speaker1: they didn't have faces.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: that's right. just seamless flesh across the front of their heads. no mistake. i just hadn't remembered it that way. up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory. that's not all. once i started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies. it was like a game. i would think about a person or a place, or an event. then i would turn the lights off. sit down in a comfortable chair... and study each detail of this subject.
speaker1: everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me...
speaker1: is there anything you haven't told me about this business? even the most insignificant thing? white no. nothing i can think of.
speaker1: go on.
speaker2: well. the only thing i've been certain of, all this time, is that i need to get to the ocean. the point is no one seems to know how to get there.
speaker1: why, that's ridiculous. you just...
speaker1: we'll get to the bottom of this. i mean it.

speaker1: i met a friend of yours the other night, doctor. tall fellow. no hair. rather pale skin... 
speaker2: i don't know what you're talking about.
speaker1: that's surprising. he was leaving your office at the time...
speaker2: you are mistaken.
speaker3: what are you hiding?
speaker2: nothing. i don't know anything!
speaker2: please, they'll kill me...
speaker1: i think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.

speaker1: in there. 
speaker2: just like that?

speaker1: what is this place? 
speaker2: you wouldn't believe me if i told you, inspector. have patience - you'll see for yourself.

speaker1: look. 
speaker2: put them on.

speaker1: get in. hurry. 
speaker2: where do you think this goes?
speaker3: it sure isn't the fun-fair.
speaker1: follow me, and do exactly as i do.

speaker1: the eye is too small for the head of the pin! 
speaker2: yes!
speaker3: what is it that floats on the water?
speaker2: indeed!
speaker4: what?
speaker5: the eye. master of time and space!
speaker4: the eye - um - delicious with horseradish on rye!
speaker4: nothing to it...
speaker6: eye... eye, captain!
speaker2: um - yes...
speaker7: my spine will bend for the eye!

speaker1: was that for real down there? 
speaker2: i'm afraid so.
speaker1: what the

speaker1: what now? 
speaker2: this ocean business... i know where i can find a map. i need to go back to the station. where will you be?
speaker1: i'll go see an uncle of mine. five - one - eight - three - double six - three...
speaker2: good. uh-oh... white turns and looks behind them. his p.o.v. - headlights gaining on them.

speaker1: yeah. that's what i said! what..? 
speaker2: i'm looking for this address.
speaker1: upstairs. through there.

speaker1: john? 
speaker2: are you alright? what are you doing here? is this one of your jokes, john? it's been so long, i thought you'd forgotten your uncle karl?
speaker3: uncle... karl.

speaker1: and this is me again about - um - i would guess about twelve feet further to the right of the last shot. now just behind the wall is the hotel i stayed at - sweet little place... 
speaker2: yes? oh, it's you... yes... my uncle apparently... just looking at some memories... you have? that's good.

speaker1: look! this is a good one! 
speaker2: what is that door?
speaker1: which one?
speaker2: there. behind the cabinet. where does it go?
speaker1: such a joker! like your father.
speaker2: no. have a look.
speaker2: you see it?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: where does it lead?
speaker1: it must be a closet or something.
speaker1: don't trip over. it's dark up there.

speaker1: john, i didn't see you there. 
speaker1: what is
speaker2: no!

speaker1: i can't wait any longer... 
speaker2: i'm sorry. i told you, she is being examined...
speaker2: mister bumstead!

speaker1: ah, inspector bumstead! we are glad you are here - i'm afraid we have done all we can. yes. your mother has passed. yes. 
speaker2: but she was getting better...
speaker1: we are sorry. the cancer - it was fatal.
speaker2: she doesn't have cancer.
speaker1: we knew that. yes. anyway - she is dead.
speaker3: you will obey us, yes. in your mind there is a dark space...

speaker1: dammit. 
speaker2: why do you always have to find things out the hard way! couldn't you just do your job, you idiot? i told you, didn't i? these people are not playing games, bumstead. they can do anything they want, don't you understand? bumstead you're one of them. you bastard... stromboli in a way, we
speaker3: the edge looms up - a long drop to the street.

speaker1: ahhh... it hurts!... 
speaker2: what happened to you?
speaker3: i'm... being... punished.
speaker3: i had to - ahhhh - find you... i..

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: we are... living in their dreams...
speaker2: insect... dreams...

speaker1: gesundheit! 
speaker2: i didn't sneeze.

speaker1: we are looking for the white victims. 
speaker2: and who the are
speaker1: thank you.

speaker1: john white... 
speaker2: there is nothing, mister white. beyond the city. never has been. unfortunate. yes?

speaker1: how did you know where to find me? 
speaker2: we knew you would turn up here
speaker3: welcome.
speaker3: john white, you are to be tried for murder, yes. you wish to confess to these crimes now?
speaker3: very well. the testimony of the prosecutors. yes.
speaker4: we will show that john white is abnormal, a menace to society, a dangerous sick individual, and that the court should have no mercy in finding him guilty and punishable to the extreme for his crimes.
speaker5: exhibit a shows the accused leaving the scene of his most recent crime, yes. a photo taken by a remote camera planted by one of our agents. white watches in stunned silence.
speaker4: exhibit b...
speaker4: actual tape recording of accused
speaker3: something to say? ready to confess?
speaker3: speak up. yes. white it's lies. everything. he grips the barrier before him.
speaker3: bring the witnesses.
speaker3: you are the accused's parents?
speaker6: that's right.
speaker7: yes.
speaker1: wait a minute...
