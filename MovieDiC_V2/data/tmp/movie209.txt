ZORG: ... and replay sends every following shot to the same location...
ZORG: ...rocket launcher. the always efficient flame thrower... my favorite. our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher, with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very practical. and for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube system!
ZORG: ...four full crates, delivered right on time! what about you, my dear aknot, did you bring me what i asked you for?

AKNOT: ...we are warriors, not merchants!
ZORG: but you can still count. look... my fingers.

ZORG: so, you are a merchant, after all. leave them one crate. for the cause!

KORBEN: so you forgive me? 
THAI: not going to open?
KORBEN: i've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.

THAI: you right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! grandfather say: "it never rain every day." this is good news guarantee.. i bet you lunch!

CORNELIUS: i remember you now..the so called art dealer.
ZORG: i'm glad you got your memory back, father... because you're going to need it... where are the stones?
CORNELIUS: ...why on earth do the stones interest you?
ZORG: personally, they are of no interest to me,
CORNELIUS: even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you.
ZORG: why? what's wrong with me?
CORNELIUS: ...i'm a priest! i'm here to serve life, all you want to do is destroy it.
ZORG: ah, father... you are so wrong. let me explain...
ZORG: ...would you like a drink?
CORNELIUS: no thank you.
ZORG: follow me.. life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. look at this empty glass. zorg pushes the glass with his finger.
ZORG: here it is... peaceful... serene... but if it is...
ZORG: destroyed...
ZORG: ...look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. notice how each one is useful. what a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. so full of..life!
CORNELIUS: they are robots!
ZORG: yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction. i gave work to at least fifty people today. the engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong. children who will have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life! cornelius sits in silence.
ZORG: father, by creating a little destruction, i am, in fact, encouraging life! so, in reality, you and i are in the same business!
CORNELIUS: destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
ZORG: let me reassure you father..i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years. zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
CORNELIUS: can i give you a hand?
ZORG: you saved my life... so, i'm going to spare yours. throw him out!
CORNELIUS: you are a monster, zorg!
ZORG: i know...
ZORG: ...torture whoever you want, the president if you have to but i want those stones. you have an hour.

PRESIDENT: why the is it eating up all those satellites like that? 
HEAD SCIENTIST: ...we're working on it, mr. president.
PRESIDENT: it should only choke on them.

MUNRO: i managed to contact the mondoshawan. they deplore the incident, but accept our apologies. 
PRESIDENT: and the stones? did you find them in the wreckage?
MUNRO: the-stones weren't aboard the ship.
PRESIDENT: ...what do you mean? the president is all ears.

210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL: korben wastes two more mangalores.
DIVA: she needs you. she needs your help and
KORBEN: ...yeah, so am i.
DIVA: she was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
KORBEN: i'll help her, i promise, but i think you should tell me where the stones are!
DIVA: do you love her?
KORBEN: i... i don't know! we hardly know each other... it takes time!
DIVA: i don't have time... i need to know.
KORBEN: listen, the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her ... i never saw her again.
DIVA: i would like to have died in peace...

KORBEN: you tell me to save the world then you go off and leave me in the

KORBEN: that's it... i've had... all day people have been sticking guns in my face... korben wraps up the four stones in his shirt.
LOC RHOD: korben man... these dudes are going to waste us if we don't do what they say. korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

COP 1: we're sending someone in who's authorized to negotiate.

KORBEN: anyone else want to negotiate? 
COP 2: where'd he learn to negotiate like that?

CORNELIUS: you're probably very angry with me and i quite understand. but i want you to know i'm fighting for a noble cause. 
KORBEN: yeah, i know... to save the world... but right now all i want to do is save leeloo.
CORNELIUS: leeloo's in trouble?
KORBEN: when is she not in trouble?
CORNELIUS: uh.. have you tried the diva's suite?

POLICEMAN: more trouble? 
ZORG: nothing i can't fix myself.

KORBEN: leeloo? 
LEELOO: korben... her voice is too weak, korben can't hear her.

ZORG: just for the fun of it.
ZORG: well, what do we have here? is this korben dallas? the famous winner of the gemini croquette contest? or is this korben dallas from special section sent by old lindberg himself.
ZORG: ...in any event, whoever you are, i was glad to meet you.
ZORG: ...a 3000 round clip! i didn't fire off 3000 rounds... did i?
KORBEN: don't you know how to count. it's not all that hard. watch!
KORBEN: one! that's for trying to kill me!
KORBEN: two! that's for firing me! three! that's for pushing around a priest! and the rest is for what you did to my wife!

KORBEN: we're outta here! he picks leeloo up in his arms. 
LOC RHOD: are you nuts, father? that hurts! i can't feel my teeth.

KORBEN: apipoulai.. 
LEELOO: i'm so very sad.
KORBEN: why? we did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
LEELOO: five hundred wars... arms... drugs... money...
KORBEN: i told you not to read all that crap!

PRESIDENT: for the praiseworthy courage you have shown us! i'd like to congratulate general munro for his choice. he found the ideal man for such a... 
KORBEN: so now what's the problem?
PRESIDENT: there's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter heading straight for the earth. and we have no idea how to stop it! ...that's the problem.
KORBEN: how much time before the collision?
SCIENTIST: if its speed remains constant... in an hour and 57 minutes.

DAVID: you're all safe. thanks be to 
CORNELIUS: later, david! later! there's not a minute to lose!

MUNRO: they just landed in the desert. 
PRESIDENT: how much time is left?

CORNELIUS: uh, this one... must be water! 
KORBEN: don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
CORNELIUS: theoretically, yes! the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... i don't have the reference book. i've never seen the stones work!
KORBEN: match the symbols!
LOC RHOD: what is this some kinda game? like chess?
KORBEN: no. it's much simpler. if we don't figure out where these stones go in five minutes, we're all dead! think you got it?
KORBEN: there's no light! you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
CORNELIUS: yes, of course, but... the stones are shut!
KORBEN: and you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
CORNELIUS: that's what i'm saying.
266	EXT.  SPACE: the dark planet closes in on earth rapidly.

KORBEN: i know all that, leeloo! i'm talking about the stones.
LEELOO: ...the rain falls...
KORBEN: the rain falls... the wind blows?
KORBEN: try and figure out how this thing opens, instead of staring at me like that! loc rhod starts feeling the stone all around.
LOC RHOD: i'm looking, i'm looking.

SCIENTIST: ...three minutes. 
MUNRO: we've lost contact with them.

LOC RHOD: ...we'll never make it. 
LOC RHOD: it... it moved! korben! korben!
KORBEN: what did you say? what did you do?
LOC RHOD: nothing! swear to i didn't do nothing!
KORBEN: look, you did something that set it off. try to remember. concentrate. tell me exactly what you did!!
LOC RHOD: i was like this... with my hands here and... i said, "we'll never make it!" that's all! nothing happens.
KORBEN: is that all?
LOC RHOD: yeah... then i sighed... like this.
KORBEN: the wind! the wind blows...
KORBEN: quickly, everyone on a stone! water for water! fire for fire! earth for earth!
KORBEN: don't breathe.

KORBEN: it's up to you now, angel! 
LEELOO: i'm so tired...
KORBEN: you can sleep tomorrow... come on...
LEELOO: i want to sleep... forever...
KORBEN: leeloo! listen to me! i'll take you on a vacation afterwards! a real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. come on! you can do it!
CORNELIUS: come on leeloo! come on!

KORBEN: leeloo! if you don't get on with the program we're all gonna die! and that's not on my agenda for today. 
LEELOO: what's the use of saving lives...
KORBEN: you're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
LEELOO: ...like love...
KORBEN: exactly.
LEELOO: but i don't know love... i'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.

LEELOO: i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... there is no need for me other than this. i'm immortal but i have no life. 
KORBEN: yes, you do! i need you. more than you can imagine! stand up straight!
LEELOO: why?... why would you need me?
KORBEN: because...
CORNELIUS: tell her, for sake!

KORBEN: because... 
LEELOO: tell me...
KORBEN: i love you...

MUNRO: mr. president, let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh, who runs the center. 
MACTILBURGH: it's an honor to receive you. mr. president.
PRESIDENT: yes.. well? where are our two heroes?
MACTILBURGH: they were so tired from their ordeal that we put them in the reactor this morning..
PRESIDENT: i have 19 more meetings after this one professor..
PROFESSOR: of course.. let me see if they're revived.
AIDE: we go live in one minute, mr. president.
MACTILBURGH: i.. uh.. they need five more minutes, mr. president.

PRESIDENT: who is it?
AIDE: some woman... claims she's korben's mother...
PRESIDENT: give it here...
PRESIDENT: mrs. dallas, this in the president. on behalf of the entire federation, i would like to thank...
MOTHER: don't pull that with me, finger... i'd recognize that trash can voice of yours in a dark alley during a rain storm. you tell that worthless no account son of mine he should plotz for the way he's ignored his mother... when i think of all i sacrificed for him...
