speaker2: eh?
speaker1: it's too...
speaker2: you get a bad month, all of a...
speaker1: you're on this...
speaker2: all of, they got you on this "board..."

speaker1: it's not. 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: and it's not right to the customers.
speaker2: i know it's not. i'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did i learn as a kid on western? don't sell a guy one car. sell him five cars over fifteen years.
speaker1: that's right?
speaker2: eh...?
speaker1: that's right?
speaker2: right, that's right. guys come on: "oh, the blah blah blah, i know what i'll do: i'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
speaker1: ...that's right...
speaker2: eh?
speaker1: no. that's absolutely right.
speaker2: and so they kill the goose. i, i, i'll...and a man, worked all his life has got to...
speaker1: ...that's right...
speaker2: ...cower in his boots...

speaker1: shoes, boots, yes... 
speaker2: for some "sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
speaker1: for some sales pro...
speaker2: ...sales promotion, "you lose, then we fire your..." no. it's medieval... it's wrong. "or we're going to fire your ass." it's wrong.
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: yes, it is. and you know who's responsible?
speaker1: who?
speaker2: you know who it is. it's mitch. and murray. 'cause it doesn't have to be this way.
speaker1: no.
speaker2: look at jerry graff. he's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see? you see? that's thinking. why take ten percent? a ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away? what are we giving ninety per...for nothing. for some jerk sit in the office tell you "get out there and close." "go win the cadillac." graff. he goes out and buys. he pays top dollar for the... you see?
speaker1: yes.

speaker1: that's thinking. now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself. he's...that's what i... that's thinking! "who? who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?" 
speaker2: nurses.
speaker1: so graff buys a list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two i'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
speaker2: he is?
speaker1: he's doing very well.
speaker2: i heard that they were running cold.
speaker1: the nurses?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: you hear a lot of things...he's doing very well. he's doing very well.
speaker2: with river oaks?
speaker1: river oaks, brook farms. all of that somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself?
speaker2: himself?

speaker1: that's what i'm saying. why? the leads. he's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the here. why? we have to go to them to get them. huh. ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads. 
speaker2: the leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
speaker1: what do you need? a telephone, some broad to say "good morning," nothing...nothing...
speaker2: no, it's not that simple, dave...
speaker1: yes. it is. it is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: starting up.
speaker2: what hard part?
speaker1: of doing the thing. the dif...the difference. between me and jerry graff. going to business for yourself. the hard part is...you know what it is?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: just the act.
speaker2: what act?

speaker1: to say "i'm going on my own." 'cause what you do, george, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. and we enslave ourselves. to please. to win some toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those... 
speaker2: that's right...
speaker1: he made up those rules, and we're working for him.
speaker2: that's the truth...
speaker1: that's the truth. and it gets me depressed. i swear that it does. at my age. to see a goddamn: "somebody wins the cadillac this month. p.s. two guys get fucked."
speaker2: huh.
speaker1: you don't ax your sales force.
speaker2: no.
speaker1: you...
speaker2: you...
speaker1: you build it!
speaker2: that's what i...
speaker1: you build it! men come...
speaker2: men come work for you...

speaker1: ...you're absolutely right. 
speaker2: they...
speaker1: they have...
speaker2: when they...
speaker1: look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no. no. you're absolutely right, and i want to tell you something.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: i want to tell you what somebody should do.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: someone should stand up and strike back.
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: somebody...
speaker2: yes...?
speaker1: should do something to them.
speaker2: what?

speaker1: something. to pay them back. someone, someone should hurt them. 
speaker2: someone should hurt them.
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: how?
speaker1: how? do something to hurt them.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: someone should rob the office.
speaker2: huh.
speaker1: that's what i'm saying. we were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the leads out of the files...go to jerry graff.
speaker2: what could somebody get for them?
speaker1: what could we get for them? i don't know. buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...i don't know...hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them? all told...must be, i'd... three bucks a throw...i don't know.

speaker1: how many leads have we got? 
speaker2: the glengarry...the premium leads...? i'd say we got five thousand. five.
speaker1: and you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to jerry graff.
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: how do you know he'd buy them?
speaker2: graff? because i worked for him.
speaker1: you haven't talked to him.
speaker2: no. what do you mean? have i talked to him about this?
speaker1: yes. i mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
speaker2: no, we're just...
speaker1: we're just "talking" about it.
speaker2: we're just speaking about it. as an idea.
speaker1: as an idea.
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: we're not actually talking about it.

speaker1: no. 
speaker2: talking about it as a...
speaker1: no.
speaker2: as a robbery.
speaker1: as a "robbery"?! no.
speaker2: well. well...
speaker1: hey.

speaker2: did you?
speaker1: what did you say?
speaker1: yes. i said, "not actually." the you care, george? we're just talking...

speaker2: because, because, you know, it's a crime.
speaker1: that's right. it's a crime. it is a crime. it's also very safe.
speaker2: you're actually talking about this?
speaker1: that's right.
speaker2: you're going to steal the leads?
speaker1: have i said that?
speaker2: are you?
speaker1: did i say that?
speaker2: did you talk to graff?
speaker1: is that what i said?
speaker2: what did he say?
speaker1: what did he say? he'd buy them.
speaker2: you're going to steal the leads and sell the leads to him?

speaker1: pause. 
speaker2: yes.
speaker3: what will he pay?
speaker2: a buck a shot.
speaker3: for five thousand?
speaker2: however they are, that's the deal. a buck a throw. five thousand dollars. split it half and half.
speaker3: you're saying "me."
speaker2: yes. twenty-five hundred apiece. one night's work, and the job with graff. working the premium leads.
speaker3: a job with graff.
speaker2: is that what i said?
speaker3: he'd give me a job.
speaker2: he would take you on. yes.
speaker3: is that the truth?

speaker1: yes. it is, george. yes. it's a big decision. and it's a big reward. it's a big reward. for one night's work. but it's got to be tonight. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: what? what? the leads.
speaker2: you have to steal the leads tonight?
speaker1: that's right, the guys are moving them downtown. after the thirtieth.

speaker1: you.
speaker2: me?
speaker1: you have to go in. you have to get the leads.
speaker2: i do?

speaker1: it's not something for nothing, george, i took you in on this, you have to go. that's your thing. i've made the deal with graff. i can't go. i can't go in, i've spoken on this too much. i've got a big mouth. "the leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the tight company..." 
speaker2: they'll know when you go over to graff...
speaker1: what will they know? that i stole the leads? i didn't steal the leads, i'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then i'm going to the como inn. why did i go to graff? i got a better deal. period. let 'em prove something. they can't prove anything that's not the case.
speaker2: dave.
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: you want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: no.

speaker1: oh, yes, george. 
speaker2: what does that mean?
speaker1: listen to this. i have an alibi, i'm going to the como inn, why? why? the place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me. why? because i probably did it. are you going to turn me in? george? are you going to turn me in?
speaker2: what if you don't get caught?
speaker1: they come to you, you going to turn me in?
speaker2: why would they come to me?

speaker1: ...you don't have to come in... 
speaker2: ...and rob the place...
speaker1: ...i thought that we were only talking...
speaker2: ...they take me, then. they're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
speaker1: me?
speaker2: absolutely.
speaker1: that's ridiculous.
speaker2: well, to the law, you're an accessory. before the fact.
speaker1: i didn't ask to be.
speaker2: then tough luck, george, because you are.
speaker1: why? why, because you only told me about it?
speaker2: that's right.
speaker1: why are you doing this to me, dave. why are you talking this way to me? i don't understand. why are you doing this at all...?

speaker2: "what we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it. and that's it." and we sit there. i got the pen out...
speaker1: "always be closing..."
speaker2: that's what i'm saying. the old ways. the old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check. the...bruce, harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...i say it, we're going to go the whole route. i plat it out eight units. eighty- two grand. i tell them. "this is now. this is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money. this is it, harriett..."
speaker1: harriett...
speaker2: bruce..."i don't want to around with you. i don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this. i do, too. i came here to do good for you and me. for both of us. why take an interim position?

speaker1: the only arrangement i'll accept is full investment. period. the whole eight units. i know that you're saying 'be safe,' i know what you're saying. i know if i left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when i walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility. but this won't do, and that's not the subject..." listen to this, i actually said this. "that's not the subject of our evening together." now i handed them the pen. i held it in my hand. i turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "now i want you to sign." i sat there. five minutes. then, i sat there, ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. not a word, not a motion. what am i thinking? "my arm's getting tired?" no. i did it. i did it. like in the old says, ricky. like i was taught... like, like, like i used to do...i did it. 
speaker2: like you taught me...
speaker1: bullshit, you're...no. that's raw... well, if i did, then i'm glad i did. i, well. i locked on them. all on them, nothing on me. all my thoughts are on them. i'm holding the last thought that i spoke: "now is the time." they signed, ricky. it was great. it was great. it was like they wilted all at once. no gesture...nothing. like together.

speaker1: they, i swear to they both kind of imperceptibly slumped. and he reaches and takes the pen and signs, he passes it to her, she signs. it was so solemn. i just let it sit. i nod like this. i nod again. i grasp his hands. i shake his hands. i grasp her hands. i nod at her like this. "bruce...harriet..." i'm beaming at them. i'm nodding like this. i point back in the living room, back to the sideboard. i didn't know there was a sideboard there!! he goes back, he brings us a drink. little shot glasses. a pattern in 'em. and we toast. in silence. 
speaker2: that was a great sale, shelly.
speaker1: ah, leads! leads! williamson! send me out! send me out!
speaker3: the leads are coming.
speaker1: get 'em to me!
speaker3: i talked to murray and mitch an hour ago. they're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
speaker1: did you tell 'em my sale?

speaker1: how could i tell 'em your sale? eh? i don't have a tel...i'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads. alright? shelly. alright? we had a little... you closed a deal. you made a good sale. fine. 
speaker2: it's better than a good sale. it's a...
speaker1: look: i have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, i'm trying to make some sense...
speaker2: all that i'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
speaker1: the only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
speaker2: what does that mean?
speaker1: that if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
speaker2: why should the sale not stick? hey, you. that's what i'm saying. you have no idea of your job. a man's his job and you're at yours. you hear what i'm saying to you? your "end of month board..." you can't run an office. i don't care. you don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls. you ever been on a sit? ever? has this ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
speaker1: i were you, i'd calm down, shelly.

speaker1: would you? would you...? or you're gonna what, fire me? 
speaker2: it's not impossible.
speaker1: on an eighty-thousand dollar day?
speaker3: you closed 'em today?
speaker1: yes. i did. this morning. what i'm saying to you: things can change. you see? this is where you up, because this is something you don't know. you can't look down the road. and see what's coming. might be someone else, john. it might be someone new, eh? someone new. and you can't look back. 'cause you don't know history. you ask them. when we were at rio rancho, who was top man? a month...? two months...? eight months in twelve for three years in a row. you know what that means? you know what that means? is that luck? is that some, some, some purloined leads? that's skill.
speaker3: ...yes...
speaker1: ...and you don't remember. 'cause you weren't around. that's cold calling. walk up to the door. i don't even know their name. i'm selling something they don't even want. you talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
speaker3: that's right, shel.

speaker1: and, and, and, i did it. and i put a kid through school. she...and...cold calling, fella. door to door. but you don't know. you don't know. you never heard of a streak. you never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." what are you, you're a secretary, john. you. that's my message for you. you and kiss my ass. you don't like it, i'll go talk to jerry graff. period. you. put me on the board. and i want three worthwhile leads today and i don't want any about them and i want 'em close together 'cause i'm going to hit them all today. that's all i have to say to you. 
speaker2: he's right, williamson.
speaker1: it's not right. i'm sorry, and i'll tell you who's to blame is mitch and murray.
speaker2: oh, christ.
speaker1: the with him. we'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
