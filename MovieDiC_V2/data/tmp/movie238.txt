"go win the cadillac." graff. he goes out and buys. he pays top dollar for the... you see?
AARONOW: yes.

MOSS: that's thinking. now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself. he's...that's what i... that's thinking! "who? who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?" 
AARONOW: nurses.
MOSS: so graff buys a list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two i'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...

AARONOW: the leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
MOSS: what do you need? a telephone, some broad to say "good morning," nothing...nothing...

MOSS: yes. it is. it is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
AARONOW: what?
MOSS: starting up.
AARONOW: what hard part?
MOSS: of doing the thing. the dif...the difference. between me and jerry graff. going to business for yourself. the hard part is...you know what it is?
AARONOW: what?
MOSS: just the act.
AARONOW: what act?

MOSS: to say "i'm going on my own." 'cause what you do, george, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. and we enslave ourselves. to please. to win some toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those... 
AARONOW: that's right...
MOSS: he made up those rules, and we're working for him.
AARONOW: that's the truth...
MOSS: that's the truth. and it gets me depressed. i swear that it does. at my age. to see a goddamn: "somebody wins the cadillac this month. p.s. two guys get fucked."
AARONOW: huh.
MOSS: you don't ax your sales force.
AARONOW: no.

AARONOW: they...
MOSS: they have...
AARONOW: when they...
MOSS: look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no. no. you're absolutely right, and i want to tell you something.
AARONOW: what?
MOSS: i want to tell you what somebody should do.
AARONOW: what?
MOSS: someone should stand up and strike back.
AARONOW: what do you mean?

MOSS: someone should rob the office.
AARONOW: huh.
MOSS: that's what i'm saying. we were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the leads out of the files...go to jerry graff.
AARONOW: what could somebody get for them?
MOSS: what could we get for them? i don't know. buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...i don't know...hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them? all told...must be, i'd... three bucks a throw...i don't know.

ROMA: ...all train compartments smell vaguely of it gets so you don't mind it. that's the worst thing that i can confess. you know how long it took me to get there? a long time. when you die you're going to regret the things you don't do. you think you're queer...? i'm going to tell you something: we're all queer. you think that you're a thief? so what? you get befuddled by a middle-class morality...? get shut of it. shut it out. you cheated on your wife...? you did it, live with it. you little girls, so be it. there's an absolute morality? may be. and then what? if you think there is, then be that thing. bad people go to hell? i don't think so. if you think that, act that way. a exists on earth? yes. i won't live in it. that's me. you ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?

ROMA: harriett...
LEVENE: bruce..."i don't want to around with you. i don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this. i do, too. i came here to do good for you and me. for both of us. why take an interim position?

LEVENE: the only arrangement i'll accept is full investment. period. the whole eight units. i know that you're saying 'be safe,' i know what you're saying. i know if i left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when i walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility. but this won't do, and that's not the subject..." listen to this, i actually said this. "that's not the subject of our evening together." now i handed them the pen. i held it in my hand. i turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "now i want you to sign." i sat there. five minutes. then, i sat there, ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock. not a word, not a motion. what am i thinking? "my arm's getting tired?" no. i did it. i did it. like in the old says, ricky. like i was taught... like, like, like i used to do...i did it. 
ROMA: like you taught me...
LEVENE: bullshit, you're...no. that's raw... well, if i did, then i'm glad i did. i, well. i locked on them. all on them, nothing on me. all my thoughts are on them. i'm holding the last thought that i spoke: "now is the time." they signed, ricky. it was great. it was great. it was like they wilted all at once. no gesture...nothing. like together.

LEVENE: they, i swear to they both kind of imperceptibly slumped. and he reaches and takes the pen and signs, he passes it to her, she signs. it was so solemn. i just let it sit. i nod like this. i nod again. i grasp his hands. i shake his hands. i grasp her hands. i nod at her like this. "bruce...harriet..." i'm beaming at them. i'm nodding like this. i point back in the living room, back to the sideboard. i didn't know there was a sideboard there!! he goes back, he brings us a drink. little shot glasses. a pattern in 'em. and we toast. in silence. 
ROMA: that was a great sale, shelly.
LEVENE: ah, leads! leads! williamson! send me out! send me out!
WILLIAMSON: the leads are coming.
LEVENE: get 'em to me!
WILLIAMSON: i talked to murray and mitch an hour ago. they're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
LEVENE: did you tell 'em my sale?

WILLIAMSON: how could i tell 'em your sale? eh? i don't have a tel...i'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads. alright? shelly. alright? we had a little... you closed a deal. you made a good sale. fine. 
LEVENE: it's better than a good sale. it's a...
WILLIAMSON: look: i have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, i'm trying to make some sense...
LEVENE: all that i'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
WILLIAMSON: the only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
LEVENE: what does that mean?
WILLIAMSON: that if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
LEVENE: why should the sale not stick? hey, you. that's what i'm saying. you have no idea of your job. a man's his job and you're at yours. you hear what i'm saying to you? your "end of month board..." you can't run an office. i don't care. you don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls. you ever been on a sit? ever? has this ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
WILLIAMSON: i were you, i'd calm down, shelly.

LEVENE: would you? would you...? or you're gonna what, fire me? 
WILLIAMSON: it's not impossible.
LEVENE: on an eighty-thousand dollar day?
ROMA: you closed 'em today?
LEVENE: yes. i did. this morning. what i'm saying to you: things can change. you see? this is where you up, because this is something you don't know. you can't look down the road. and see what's coming. might be someone else, john. it might be someone new, eh? someone new. and you can't look back. 'cause you don't know history. you ask them. when we were at rio rancho, who was top man? a month...? two months...? eight months in twelve for three years in a row. you know what that means? you know what that means? is that luck? is that some, some, some purloined leads? that's skill.
ROMA: ...yes...
LEVENE: ...and you don't remember. 'cause you weren't around. that's cold calling. walk up to the door. i don't even know their name. i'm selling something they don't even want. you talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
ROMA: that's right, shel.

LEVENE: and, and, and, i did it. and i put a kid through school. she...and...cold calling, fella. door to door. but you don't know. you don't know. you never heard of a streak. you never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." what are you, you're a secretary, john. you. that's my message for you. you and kiss my ass. you don't like it, i'll go talk to jerry graff. period. you. put me on the board. and i want three worthwhile leads today and i don't want any about them and i want 'em close together 'cause i'm going to hit them all today. that's all i have to say to you. 
ROMA: he's right, williamson.
LEVENE: it's not right. i'm sorry, and i'll tell you who's to blame is mitch and murray.
ROMA: oh, christ.
LEVENE: the with him. we'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
