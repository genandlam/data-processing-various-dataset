BENZA: maybe glen already picked up the disks.
TUZEE: i took the call from glen personally. they're still in smith's house.
FISCHER: maybe we're getting too dramatic. it's three kids. they'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that. why would they search the house?
BENZA: you think we should take that chance?
FISCHER: i guess not.
BENZA: i guess not, too. how much information is in the house?
TUZEE: smith was cooking the books for the irs. that means he has it all: the cash flow, where it comes from, how we launder it, our split with the east.
FISCHER: it's on two computer disks he calls marlon and al.
BENZA: what, he's cute? that's his idea of humor?
FISCHER: if the feds get those disks, the east coast is gonna take a hit, too. you should let them know.

TALLEY: can you identify this man?

DENNIS: we can take it with us. 
MARS: you can't run with suitcases. dennis grabs mars by the arm, stopping him --
DENNIS: then we'll stuff it up our asses. this is the payoff. this is every dream you ever had, all in those two bags.

ANCHOR: -- thought to be dennis james rooney. rooney was recently released from the antelope valley correctional institute where he served time for robbery. dennis spots himself on television and breaks into a big smile --

THOMAS: jen!!!
KEVIN: stop it! stop it, dennis!
DENNIS: that's right. that's a good idea, mars.
MARS: find something: extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.

MARS: tie her to the chair. i'll take care of the windows when i finish with the boy.

MARS: better.
KEVIN: make sure she can breathe.
MARS: go downstairs, kevin.
MARS: i want to show you something.
MARS: it cost two hundred forty dollars, but i was happy to spend it. i love my mom. you see these?
MARS: my mom burned me with cigarettes.

THOMAS: sit still! if they're in the security room, they can see you on the monitors. 
THOMAS: i figured out what these cameras can see last year when mom and dad went to lake arrowhead. it can't see me over here, but it's looking at you, so don't move!
JENNIFER: ow!
THOMAS: be quiet! listen!

MADDOX: doing it now!
MARTIN: i'd like you to brief my supervisors before we take over the scene.
TALLEY: whatever you want.

KEVIN: someone should stay with mr. smith. what if he wakes up?

KEVIN: that's crazy, dennis. the cops will see us.
DENNIS: not if they're looking at something else.
KEVIN: like what?
MARS: let's burn the house.

KEVIN: we can't carry all this. it's too heavy. 
DENNIS: i've been carrying you our whole lives.
KEVIN: everything we're doing is making it worse. you can't let him burn this house.
DENNIS: nothing's worse than listening to you. i'm warning you, kevin--stop holding me back. now you pick up that money and get ready to go.

DENNIS: the cops are comin'!

DENNIS: i want a helicopter to take us to mexico.
TALLEY: that's not going to happen, dennis. they won't give you a helicopter.

TALLEY: he says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
MARTIN: he must've siphoned it from the cars.
TALLEY: if you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs. the whole place would go up.

TALLEY: that's why you get the big bucks, captain.

TALLEY: what's wrong with the radio?
LOUISE'S VOICE: other people can hear us. just call.
TALLEY: stand by.
TALLEY: is something wrong with jane?
LOUISE: we have a boy on the line. he says he's thomas smith and he's calling from the house.
TALLEY: it's a crank, louise. c'mon, don't waste my time with that!
LOUISE: his cell number belongs to the smiths. i think it's real, chief. i think this boy is inside that house. talley worries it only for a moment --
TALLEY: put him on.
TALLEY: get martin. right away.
TALLEY: this is chief talley. tell me your name, son.
THOMAS: thomas smith. i'm in the house that's on tv. dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up. you gotta help him.
TALLEY: slow down, thomas. take it easy and talk to me. was your father shot?
THOMAS: dennis hit him. his head's all big and he won't wake up. i'm really scared.
TALLEY: how about you and your sister?
THOMAS: we're okay.
TALLEY: where are you right now?
THOMAS: in my room.
TALLEY: that's on the second floor. could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
THOMAS: they nailed the windows. i can't get'm open.
TALLEY: i've got the boy on the phone. he's using a cell phone. what was that, son? i didn't hear you.

THOMAS: they're coming!
TALLEY: thomas? thomas...?
TALLEY: he says that his father's hurt.
MARTIN: if we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
TALLEY: they have security cameras. rooney would see you coming.
MARTIN: did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
TALLEY: no. he said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
MARTIN: then i think we should wait. do you agree?
TALLEY: you want me to stick around, i could --
MARTIN: you've been here all day, chief. take a break. see your family. if i need you, i'll call.

TALLEY: take it easy. 
THE WATCHMAN: where's your gun?
TALLEY: i'm the chief. i don't carry it.
TALLEY: who are you?
THE WATCHMAN: follow the mustang. we won't go far.

THE WATCHMAN: i know you're scared, but unless you do something stupid we're not going to hurt you. you understand? 
THE WATCHMAN: don't just sit there, dumbass. do you understand?
TALLEY: what do you want?
THE WATCHMAN: these guys are going to take hold of you. don't freak out. it's for your own good.
TALLEY: what is this?
THE WATCHMAN: say hello.
JANE'S VOICE: jeff? is that you?
THE WATCHMAN: i know, i know--she's all right. your kid's all right, too. c'mon, now, relax. from this point on, you control what happens to them.
THE WATCHMAN: can we let go? you past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
TALLEY: you can let go.
THE WATCHMAN: here's the deal--walter smith has two computer disks like this in his house. they're labeled 'marlon' and 'al.'
TALLEY: marlon and al....
THE WATCHMAN: we want them. you will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
TALLEY: i can't control what happens. the sheriffs are running the scene.
THE WATCHMAN: you will re-assume command. in two hours, a group of my people will arrive at york estates. you will tell the sheriffs that they are an fbi tactical team.
THE WATCHMAN: when this phone rings, you answer. it will be me. i'll tell you what to do. when i have what i want, you get your family.
TALLEY: you want . . . marlon and al.
THE WATCHMAN: i have people in york estates right under your nose. if you do anything except what i'm telling you, you'll get jane and amanda back in the mail. we clear on that?
TALLEY: these disks . . . where are they?
THE WATCHMAN: smith will know.
THE WATCHMAN: when it rings, answer.

ANDERS: what's up, chief? 
ANDERS: did i do something wrong?
TALLEY: i want you to run this license plate and phone number. then i want you to find out everything you can about walter smith.
ANDERS: the guy in the house?
TALLEY: go back to the office. run his name through the fbi and the nlets database. i think he's involved with illegal activity or he associates with people who are.
ANDERS: wow. sure, right away, chief.
TALLEY: don't tell anyone what you're doing, not louise, not the other guys, not the sheriffs. you understand me, larry?

ANDERS: i guess so. 
TALLEY: guessing. you keep your mouth shut.
ANDERS: i will, chief. absolutely.
TALLEY: get to work.

TALLEY: i'm re-assuming command of the scene. 
TALLEY: martin is surprised and angry --

TALLEY: let me come get him.
DENNIS: that! you will jump me!
TALLEY: if you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
DENNIS: you'll cap my as soon as i step out the door!
TALLEY: you've already helped yourself once, dennis; be smart again. if you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
DENNIS: you, talley, you! you and one other guy, but that's it! i want you stripped! i gotta know you don't have guns! dennis slams down the phone --
TALLEY: bring up the ambulance.

TALLEY: easy....

KLAUS: ain't gonna happen. we've got unequal pupilation. he could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
TALLEY: smith! wake up!
KLAUS: what are you doing?! stop that!
KLAUS: this man needs a hospital! stop it!
TALLEY: use smelling salts, give him a shot, whatever. i just need a minute.
TALLEY: stop the engine!
KLAUS: i'm not going to wake him. i don't even know that i can.
TALLEY: just one question. please.
KLAUS: he. can't. answer.

TALLEY: i want you waiting in smith's lap. i want to know the second--and i mean the second--that he wakes up. 
TALLEY: talley.
ANDERS' VOICE: it's me, chief. can you talk?
TALLEY: what'd you find out?
ANDERS' VOICE: the cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in beverly hills. the phone company shows no unusual --
TALLEY: dead end--it's a clone. what about the mustang?
ANDERS' VOICE: it was stolen.
TALLEY: you get anything on smith?
ANDERS' VOICE: chief...it's like none of this exists.
TALLEY: keep trying.
DENNIS: i'll be safe when i'm outta here, you asshole! i'm not talking any more!

HOWELL: was smith talking? 
SEYMORE: i heard he's up. they're taking him to the hospital.
HOWELL: goddamnit, tell me what you know. did the cops go in? did smith have the disks?
SEYMORE: i don't know. talley talked those punks into letting smith out. he's us over, glen. that guy is us over.
HOWELL: what hospital?
SEYMORE: canyon country.
HOWELL: i have another job for you.

TALLEY: put him on. 
THOMAS: is my daddy okay?
TALLEY: the doctors are taking care of him right now. thomas . . . are you safe? can you talk?
THOMAS: i think so.
TALLEY: i need your help with something. but if you think those guys could catch you, then i don't want you to do it, okay?
THOMAS: okay.
TALLEY: i'm serious, thomas; i don't want you to get hurt.
THOMAS: what do you want me to do?
TALLEY: your dad has two computer disks. they have funny names: marlon and al.
THOMAS: he has lots of disks.
TALLEY: i think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office. could you find them and see who they belong to?
THOMAS: dennis won't let me go to the desk. he makes me sit on the floor.
THOMAS: but i might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around. then i could open the disks here in my room.
TALLEY: i thought they locked you in your room.
THOMAS: i can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
TALLEY: can you get into the office?
THOMAS: i can get into the den. the office is right across the hall.
TALLEY: if i get rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
THOMAS: yes, sir.

MARTIN: i want to know what in you're doing. 
TALLEY: i'm looking for you. i need your tactical unit.
MARTIN: i'm not stupid! you can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
TALLEY: don't question me, captain! this is my crime scene!
MARTIN: maddox! let's give the man a hand!

DENNIS: keep the change, m'man. 
KEVIN: we're
DENNIS: we're until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
KEVIN: there is no way out.
DENNIS: for chrissake, please! help me celebrate! i figured it out!
KEVIN: celebrate what? going to prison?
DENNIS: no, dumbass--talley. talley's the guy who keeps us in here, and talley's the guy who can let us out.
DENNIS: cops want to be rich like everyone else. all we have to do is share. and if he wants someone to swing for the chinaman, we'll give'm mars.
MARS: dennis.
MARS: the food's ready.

TALLEY: okay, bud, here we go. 
TALLEY: captain? kill the lights.

TALLEY'S VOICE: it's time to talk face-to-face, dennis. 
KEVIN: what's he doing? what's going on?!
DENNIS: mars! they're trying to blindside us! check the front!

DENNIS'S VOICE: what's going on out front? 
DENNIS'S VOICE: mars?! what the are they doin'?
DENNIS'S VOICE: mars! something's happening! get back here! the feet hesitate, then, finally, walk away --

TALLEY: come on, dennis. talk to me. 
TALLEY: i'm unarmed. i'm looking at you. get out here and let's talk.
DENNIS: you got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
TALLEY: only if you try to grab me. we could've shot you from the wall.
TALLEY: you've been in there a long time.
DENNIS: would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
TALLEY: i'd be trying to get the best deal that i could.
DENNIS: maybe that's what i'm doing. can i reach in my pocket, show you something?
DENNIS: that's fifty hundred-dollar bills. five grand. they got money in this house, talley, more than you've ever seen. dennis pushes the money back into his pocket.
DENNIS: how much would it be worth to you, getting me out of here?
TALLEY: you picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
DENNIS: two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
TALLEY: give up.
DENNIS: there's a million dollars in there, maybe two million. i'll give you half.

TALLEY: the man you sent to the hospital is a criminal. he has partners. this is their house and their money and they want it back. 
DENNIS: it ain't been a good day, chief.
TALLEY: give up, dennis. let these people go. at least you'll have your life.

THOMAS: i got'm! 
TALLEY: can you open them?
THOMAS: i opened marlon. i think it's somebody's taxes.
TALLEY: look for names. does it say whose taxes they are?
THOMAS: i don't see any people names. it's all businesses.
TALLEY: try al. see if you can open al.
THOMAS: yeah! here's a name. this is somebody's personal tax --

METZGER'S VOICE: i'm at the hospital.
TALLEY: put a guard on smith! i want you with smith until i get there!
JORGENSON: what's going on?
TALLEY: get in the car. now.

TALLEY: i'm posting a guard outside his room, but we'll need help from hospital security. 
REESE: is my staff in danger?
TALLEY: not with my officers here, no, ma'am.
METZGER: hey! he's waking up!

WALTER: where am i? 
KLAUS: canyon country hospital. do you remember your name? it takes walter a few moments to answer --
WALTER: walter smith.
WALTER: where are my children?
TALLEY: they're still in the house.
TALLEY: i'm jeff talley, the bristo chief of police. so far as we know, your children are okay.
KLAUS: chief talley is the one who got you out.
TALLEY: sonny benza has my wife and daughter. he wants the disks, marlon and al. he took my family to make me help.
WALTER: i don't know what you're talking about.
TALLEY: he's going to kill you. don't you know that? he can't take the chance that you'll talk.
KLAUS: that's enough.
TALLEY: another minute. please --

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE: you fuckwad cop, you up bad! 
TALLEY: do you think i'm going to let you murder someone?!
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE: you want a blowtorch on your daughter's pretty face?!
TALLEY: i'll go in that house right now! i'll give those disks to the real fbi, you cocksuckingmotherfucker!! and i've got smith! i've got smith!!
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE: i guess we each have something the other wants.

THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE: my people are good to go. you know who i mean?
TALLEY: your phony fbi assholes.
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE: we're almost home, you and me. keep your together. this isn't l.a.
TALLEY: what do you mean by that?
THE WATCHMAN'S VOICE: you don't want another dead child on your conscience. the line goes dead --

DENNIS: i shouldn't have told him about the money. now talley is gonna keep it for himself. 
KEVIN: he said that?
DENNIS: if we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash. that's how we'll stay alive.
KEVIN: what are you talking about?
DENNIS: the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it. he's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights. he's probably planning it right now.
KEVIN: that's crazy. he's not going to kill us.
DENNIS: kevin, you're so stupid...
KEVIN: it's over. we have to give up.
DENNIS: it's over. that money's mine.
KEVIN: that money's up your brain. talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be killed!
DENNIS: then we might as well die rich.
KEVIN: i'm not going to die for this!
DENNIS: you're my anchor, kevin, the lead around my life that i've been draggin' like a cripple leg!
DENNIS: get this into your stupid head, kevin. we're not leaving without the money.
DENNIS: you got something to say?

JENNIFER: i can't go without thomas.
KEVIN: all three of us will go, but we have to move fast. mars and dennis don't know i'm doing this.
JENNIFER: how can we get out?
KEVIN: dennis and mars are in the den. i'll get your brother, then come back for you. we'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
JENNIFER: yes.

TALLEY: yeah.
HOWELL: you got ten minutes. if you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.

BELDONE: the house is in flames, benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood. 
CASTELLANO: christ, it's a clusterfuck.
BELDONE: you wanted to let sonny handle it. i would've moved in when we first found out.
CASTELLANO: and by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
BELDONE: yes, sir. but what about the disks? if the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.

BELDONE: what do you want to do?
CASTELLANO: our people out there, they good people?
BELDONE: the best.

TALLEY: first my girls. i get my girls, you get the other disk.
HOWELL: aim your gun at the woman's head. if he doesn't give me the disk, kill her. marion presses a gun to jane's temple -- talley jerks his gun toward howell --
TALLEY: i'll kill you! you won't get the other disk!
HOWELL: if you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter. do you want to lose both of them?
HOWELL: the negotiation is over, talley. i won. now give me the disk or he'll put her brain on the glass.
TALLEY: i love you. he's saying good-bye.
TALLEY: i gave the other one to the sheriffs and they're giving it to the real fbi. this one's a fake.
HOWELL: you'd better be kidding.
TALLEY: i'm a cop, you asshole! what did you expect me to do? pretend all this never happened?
TALLEY: benza's over. you're over. i just want to take my family home.
HOWELL: are you out of your mind?
MARION: you up, glen.
HOWELL: kill them.
MARION: no fuckups allowed.
MARION: it's like a storm, isn't it? this raging force that you can't control does whatever it wants, and the best you can do is survive. a winner survives.
TALLEY: why...?
MARION: what good would it do to kill you? the police already have the disk.
MARION: your wife is a very nice lady.
