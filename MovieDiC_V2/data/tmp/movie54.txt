SISTER MARY FRANCIS: i didn't hear you.
SISTER MARY FRANCIS: step away from the curb, children.

SISTER MARY FRANCIS: you're late again, rick. 
RICK: i know, sister, but i have a very good excuse.
SISTER MARY FRANCIS: there can be no excuse for tardiness.
RICK: you're absolutely right. i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. i'm just weak, sister; i'm so weak.
SISTER MARY FRANCIS: all right, stop that... children, on the bus.
RICK: sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? if you do, why don't you give me a call. i'm in the book.
SISTER MARY FRANCIS: get going, rick... you're late enough as it is.

BOBBIE: he's not gonna be happy. and your parents can't be too thrilled either.
DEBBIE: no. as far as they're concerned the only good rick is a dead rick. but i don't care... it's my decision.
PHOEBE: i'm totally blown away. you're getting married. it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex.
BOBBIE: deb, i want to throw you a shower.
DEBBIE: oh, that's really sweet. i'd love that.
PHOEBE: we'll invite all the girls.
BOBBIE: i don't believe it... mrs. rick stahl.

DEBBIE: you're a slob. 
RICK: but a fabulous cook.
DEBBIE: what are we having?
RICK: it's either meatloaf, swiss steak or charred flesh. i won't know till it's finished.
DEBBIE: i think your dinner's burning.
RICK: don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
DEBBIE: want to hear something great? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower. it's really gonna be fun.
RICK: not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
DEBBIE: you're going to have a bachelor party?
RICK: of course. i'm a traditional guy... it's a traditional event. well, what do you think?
DEBBIE: it looks awful.
RICK: yes, but looks are deceiving... not in this case, however.
DEBBIE: are you going to have women at your party?
RICK: no, sweetheart, it's a stag party. does stay home.
DEBBIE: i'm not talking about does. i'm talking about hookers.
RICK: oh, those. why do you ask?
DEBBIE: because from what i've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
RICK: deb, you is my woman now. i is yo man. no painted lady ever gonna come between us.
DEB: i need you to promise.
RICK: okay, you got it. i got a way we can seal the deal -- what'd you say?

DEBBIE: cole? 
COLE: over here, deb... in the smokehouse.
COLE: hi, deb. just got back from the mountains. isn't this a beauty?... it's gonna look great in the den.
DEBBIE: cole, we've got to talk.
COLE: finally realized rick's a jerk, huh?
DEBBIE: no, cole, i...
COLE: it's all right, i forgive you. i'm not the vengeful type. we'll forget what happened. why don't we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas.
DEBBIE: cole, listen to me... i've got to tell you...
COLE: you know, when you dumped me for that wimp, i thought, cole, she'll be back. wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
DEBBIE: cole, i'm marrying rick.
COLE: you're marrying him? then why are you coming back to me?
DEBBIE: i'm not. i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
COLE: you know how that makes me feel, deb? wanta know how that makes me feel? angry, deb. yesss, that's the word, angry. but if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. i want you to be happy, deb. no matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. be happy, deb. be oh, so very, very happy.
DEBBIE: cole, i'm sorry, i...
COLE: that's all right, deb. go be happy and smile a lot, deb. do it for me.
DEBBIE: i'm going now, cole.
COLE: i understand, deb. 'bye... be happy.

STAN: okay, rick, hold out your arm. 
RICK: you wouldn't hurt your own brother, would you? i changed my mind. i don't need a blood test. the marriage is off. i -- just then, stan sticks the needle in his arm.
RICK: you always were sneaky, stan, very sneaky.
STAN: rick, marriage will be good for you. it's done wonders for me.
RICK: true, you're a lot handsomer now. don't you have enough blood already?
STAN: you won't miss a thing about being single... the wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... i miss that.
RICK: stan, you're depressing me... hey, i didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. just take a couple of gallons, okay?
RICK: that's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
STAN: okay, rick, all finished. i can't wait for that bachelor party... i need the action.
RICK: hi, tina.
TINA: rick... mr. goldsmith, this is my brother-in- law. he's getting married.
PATIENT: congratulations.
TINA: nurse, will you take over?
TINA: i'm so happy for you.

RICK: oops! 
MR. THOMERSON: all right, who serves?
DEBBIE: you do, daddy.
MR. THOMERSON: rick, hit the ball easier, son. you don't have to kill it.
RICK: can't i just maim it a little?
MRS. THOMERSON: er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
MR. THOMERSON: no. let's at least finish the set.

RICK: well, i have to admit my game's a little rusty, but i love polo. it's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. really a beautiful experience. 
MR. THOMERSON: rick, i want to cut through the b.s.
RICK: i'd love that.
MR. THOMERSON: good. i think you're an no, let me correct that, an immature which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and i'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
RICK: mr. thomerson, i...
MR. THOMERSON: let me finish. debbie's an adult. she can do what she wants. but if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. if i may make some suggestions...
RICK: feel free.
MR. THOMERSON: first, you're a slob. you have to dress for success. second, your outlook on life...

MRS. THOMERSON: i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year. 
DEBBIE: great, mom.
ILENE: if i were you, i'd worry less about the shower and more about rick's bachelor party.
DEBBIE: ilene, why would i want to do that? i trust rick.
ILENE: of course you do. i trusted my ex, mel, too. cousin, i can only talk from experience. what do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
DEBBIE: ilene, rick promised...
ILENE: debbie, don't be naive. men are pigs.
MRS. THOMERSON: girls, why don't we go inside for lunch. boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?

MR. THOMERSON: in a second... and you're irresponsible. show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words. 
RICK: well, sir, that's quite a list. but you're absolutely right. and if i work hard at it, i think i can be a totally changed person by the time we finish lunch...

COLE: hi, everybody. am i late? 
MR. THOMERSON: not at all. we're just finishing lunch.
COLE: good to see you, mrs. thomerson. hello, debbie.
COLE: and...
RICK: bond... james bond.

MR. THOMERSON: so, cole, you been practicing your game? 
COLE: sure have...
DEBBIE: why is cole here?
MRS. THOMERSON: you know your father enjoys his company.
RICK: much the way hitler enjoyed hanging out with mussolini.
MR. THOMERSON: nice shot.
COLE: thank you, sir.
MR. THOMERSON: i know you're as unhappy as i am about debbie's marriage to rick.
COLE: yes, sir, i am.
MR. THOMERSON: cole, i don't want you to give up on her.
COLE: i've tried to change her mind.
MR. THOMERSON: it's not her mind you need to change. it's disneyland head in there.
COLE: but how can i do that?
MR. THOMERSON: if it were me, i'd reason with him first. then, if that failed... ...i'd take more persuasive action.
COLE: thanks for the advise, sir.
MR. THOMERSON: keep me informed. push in on cole. this is a man with a plan...

MR. THOMERSON: the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck. 
MRS. THOMERSON: you can tell a man by his friends.
FATHER FALWELL: they're not such a bad bunch.
MR. THOMERSON: no? that's his best man peeing on a tree.

FATHER FALWELL: if everyone would take their positions... 
FATHER FALWELL: he's orchestrating the proceedings.
FATHER FALWELL: flower girls... now rick... good... debbie and mr. thomerson.

RICK: cole. don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding? 
COLE: i want debbie.
RICK: cole...
COLE: you dump her and i'll give you cash.
RICK: what's debbie's blue book value right now?
COLE: five thousand dollars.
RICK: no.
COLE: seventy-five hundred.
RICK: not interested.
COLE: okay, ten thousand plus a g.e. toaster oven, a litton microwave, a cuisinart...
RICK: i'm marrying debbie.
COLE: michelin tires... brand new. a set of sears best metric tools...
RICK: what is this person's story here?
O'NEILL: the way i see it, the big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances lying around.
DEBBIE: cole, what are you doing here?
MR. THOMERSON: he's just trying to save you from making a mistake. a big mistake.
RICK: thanks, dad. cole, go away.
COLE: he's gonna hurt you, debbie. he'll never be true to you the way i would.
RICK: thank you. we'll all keep that in mind. 'bye now.
COLE: rick, me and you aren't through yet.
RICK: you think the gods are telling me something?

RICK: huh? wha... 
DEBBIE: i can't sleep.
RICK: oh... i got something for that.
DEBBIE: stop fooling around... i need to talk.
RICK: what's the matter?
DEBBIE: i don't know... i just feel scared.
RICK: about what?
DEBBIE: the wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
RICK: i think the only think you've left out are our relations with the soviet union. sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
DEBBIE: before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
RICK: c'mere.
DEBBIE: that feels so great.
RICK: good...
DEBBIE: um... that's very relaxing.
RICK: now, i want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.

RYKO: you sure gary's got this whole party deal together?

LARRY: she hates me. it's over. you'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. you sure you want to go through with it, man?
RICK: what do you mean, it changes?
DEBBIE: larry, how are you?

O'NEILL: i don't get it. why didn't you go for it just now?

RICK: nah, not yet. look, you're my older brother. i need some advice here. what's the deal with marriage? what can i expect?
STAN: well, the first month it's great. the second month things calm down a little. by the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
RICK: thanks, stan, you've been a lot of help.

O'NEILL: rick, i'm concerned. 
RICK: about what?
O'NEILL: this is your bachelor party. you haven't had with anyone yet.
RICK: get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
O'NEILL: i got something you can't resist. i have a friend, tracey. she wants to meet you. she loves to please.
RICK: oooooo.
O'NEILL: right in there, pal.
RICK: if i'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
O'NEILL: that's the old rick!

RICK: hellooo! 
RICK: eat my chair!
TRACEY: take me... please.

TRACEY/DEBBIE: you promised me, rick. you promised you wouldn't make love to anyone else. 
TRACEY: her face transforms into sister mary francis.
TRACEY/SISTER MARY FRANCIS: don't go back on your word, rick. be true; be strong.

RICK: i can't do it. 
TRACEY: her face becomes stan's.
TRACEY/STAN: you nuts? look at me, i'm beautiful!

KIDS: do it! come on! put her away! go for it! 
TRACEY/DEBBIE: don't rick.
RICK: i can't do it. i love debbie.

O'NEILL: how'd it go? 
RICK: put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
O'NEILL: i'm proud of you, lad.

RAJAH: am looking for this dunghead who took my women... he is being liar to me. 45 minutes way over. 
COLE'S POV: he has rick right where he wants him.
CROSSBOW TRIGGER: cole's finger squeezes off a shot.

RICK: who was that? 
O'NEILL: i don't know.
RICK: what's this?
O'NEILL: got me.
RICK: how 'bout this?
O'NEILL: still drawing a blank.
RICK: he look familiar?
O'NEILL: very.
RICK: c'mon. get the hookers in a circle. we better put cochise out of business.

LAVERNE: stay away from me. 
CHULO: i'm not gonna hassle you... don't worry. you look beautiful.
LAVERNE: think so? i borrowed it from one of the girls. i don't look too fat?
CHULO: you're an angel... a madonna.
STAGE MANAGER: you're on.

MC: all right, here is your question, miss... er... 
LAVERNE: rivas.
MC: miss rivas... yes... how would you solve our country's present economic problems?
LAVERNE: who, me?
MC: yes.
LAVERNE: that's a good question. from the way i understand it, according to supply side economics, when supply exceeds demand, recession is the result. that's why i think we should control the credit markets and increase the prime rate. that way, the consumer price index will stabilize and we will have economic recovery.
ANGLE - THE CROWD: they break into spontaneous applause.
ANGLE - CHULO: he is totally blown away.

CHULO: how'd you know all that stuff? you're a real brain. 
LAVERNE: nah, i used to a librarian.
CHULO: wow!

DEBBIE: i don't believe we're doing this. 
MANAGER: can i help you, ladies?
DEBBIE: yes, we're looking for the stahl party.
MANAGER: room 1002.

ILENE: you're making a big mistake. 
MILT: shut up. you still got another job to do here.
MRS. THOMERSON: what kind of job? i'm a housewife.
DEBBIE: quiet, mother.
MILT: get in there.

JAPANESE ONE: nice looking quim, huh, bob? 
JAPANESE TWO: yeah, you know me, ray, i've always been a sucker for redheads.
JAPANESE FOUR: hubba-hubba.
BOBBIE: let's get out of here, girls.
DEBBIE: guys, take it easy. guys.

COLE: yeah? 
TRACEY: make love to me... please.

RICK: t minus... 3... 2... 1. we have ignition. 
COLE: hey!

COLE: you guys are never going to get away with this. 
RICK: we're just going to keep you in a safe place until after the party.

COLE'S POV: the hotel parking lot is ten stories below. 
COLE: he looks up to the guys.
RICK AND O'NEILL: they look down at him from the window above.
RICK: now, don't get into any trouble.
O'NEILL: take care.
RICK and O'NEILL: byeeeee!
RICK: don't you wish you were a guy so you could have fun like this?
COLE: he's scared to death.

MAN: why don't you get comfortable? 
WOMAN: she screams, horrified.

MC: all right, can we have our five finalists, please. 
CHULO: good luck, laverne.
ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON: he gives an envelope to the mc.
MC: thank you, mr. thomerson. well, the judges have made their decision, and this year's miss moosehead beer is...
ANGLE - THE GIRLS: they are all nervous, especially laverne.
MC: laverne rivas.

JUDGE: i know i've had that girl. 
MR. THOMERSON: and i know that guy from somewhere, too.

STAN: how the are we supposed to get this donkey inside? 
RYKO: i don't know.
STAN: what? i thought you told me you had it all figured out.
RYKO: maybe i did... i don't remember.
STAN: i'd love to get you in an operating room. just once.

RYKO: can you believe how perfect it fits? 
STAN: yeah. who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
O'NEILL: hey, you guys...
RICK: who's your friend?
STAN: oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. we're bringing them to the party.
RICK: great.
RICK: say no more.
MANAGER: i don't know which one of you did this, but you're not going anywhere till you clean up this disgusting mess.

MANAGER: i'll have the boy take your bags up. 
MANAGER: excuse me. i seem to have a hand full of potty.

EXECUTIVE: thanks for helping us out, ed. we appreciate it. 
MR. THOMERSON: any time, al.
MR. THOMERSON: cole, my boy, what are you doing here? what happened?
COLE: the bachelor party's upstairs. they made me get naked. they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down...
MR. THOMERSON: take hold of yourself. what room are they in?

MR. THOMERSON: all right, i'll go up there and take care of this myself. you look awful, son. go find yourself some clothes. 
COLE: yes, sir.

RICK: hi, guys. we brought back a friend. 
LARRY: it's bullwinkle.
O'NEILL: gentlemen... ladies... for your viewing pleasure, meet mike the magical sexual mule.
RICK: how about this, a trojan donkey.
O'NEILL: and here's mike's partner, in more ways than one. a gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. the very lovely, miss desiree...
ANGLE - THE PARTY GUESTS: they all scream and holler approval.

DESIREE: c'mon, mike... come to mama.

CHULO: what the happened?
STAN: drug overdose.
DESIREE: you mean it's...
STAN: afraid so. i did everything i could.
LARRY: it's my fault. he's dead because... i left those drugs...
RICK: it's really not all your fault. i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. personal things, you know. made some bad investments. at least now he's peaceful...
O'NEILL: c'mon, we gotta get this thing out of here.

MANAGER: yes... i see... of course we don't allow that sort of thing here, ma'am. no... well, i'm sorry the noise woke you. i'll take care of it right away. 
MANAGER: i've had enough of this.
MANAGER: that's it. i'm calling the cops.

RICK: welcome, welcome, one and all. 
MR. THOMERSON: rick!
RICK: oh, no!
RICK: it's mr. laughs.
MR. THOMERSON: this is it. you're through. when debbie hears about this she'll never see you again. now i'm calling the cops to break up this orgy... and toss your in jail!
O'NEILL: what are you going to do about it?
RICK: what can i do? i'm dead. debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
O'NEILL: i'll stop him... you stall him.

RICK: mr. thomerson! 
RICK: please, no. don't ruin my life. please!
RICK: it's not me. i was brought up on the wrong side of the tracks. a victim of my environment...

O'NEILL: is that all the coke in the place? 
LARRY: that's it.
O'NEILL: good.

RICK: the end. 
MR. THOMERSON: no sob story is going to change my mind.
O'NEILL: the phone's all yours.
MR. THOMERSON: i never liked you. i've never liked any of your friends. i've hated you from the first time i saw you. and now you are out of my life. you are out of my life!
O'NEILL: reach out and snort someone.
RICK: i'm saved. let's party!

DEBBIE: let's give them what they want. 
PHOEBE: what?
DEBBIE: let's go. everyone inside.
BOBBIE: deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
DEBBIE: right in here. the big show starts in one minute.
DEBBIE: let's go.
ILENE: look, girls -- i'll stay behind and hold them off. the rest of you break for it!
DEBBIE: ilene, are you crazy?
ILENE: i know what i'm doing... go!

MRS. THOMERSON: i hope ilene's all right. 
DEBBIE: i hope those guys are all right.

O'NEILL: guess who's here? another surprise guest. 
RICK: who?
O'NEILL: debbie.
RICK: my debbie?
O'NEILL: what's with her costume?
RICK: i don't know... go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
O'NEILL: you got it.
O'NEILL: hi, baby. you're new here. i don't think the groom's had you yet, has he?
DEBBIE: no, not yet. where is he?

RICK: i can't see anything. 
DEBBIE: don't turn on the lights, sugar. i'll lead you around.
RICK: how wonderful. a seeing eye hooker.
DEBBIE: why don't you get undressed.
RICK: it's a lovely day in the neighborhood. it's a lovely day, it's a beauty, would you be mine, could you be mine. ...please won't you be my neighbor. hi... hi there... today we're going to learn about anatomy... he jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately. debbie snaps on the lights. she throws off her wig and she and rick come face to face.
RICK: debbie... you're a hooker! i can't believe it!
DEBBIE: i can't trust you!
RICK: c'mon, i knew it was you.
DEBBIE: rick, you're lying!

DEBBIE: let go of me! 
RICK: debbie, i'm telling you, i didn't do anything, hardly.
DEBBIE: the marriage is off. now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
RICK: i don't want that. i want to be with you.
DEBBIE: and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
RICK: i am committed. i love you.
DEBBIE: i don't believe you.
RICK: you don't believe me? okay, fine.
RICK: people! can i have your attention... people!
RICK: i want to ask you all a question. have i had with anybody in this room tonight?

RICK: of course, sir. that explains it. leather is a very good source of vitamin e.

RICK: your attention, please. may i be the first to say, it's a raid! 
RICK: i'm glad no one is panicking.

MRS. THOMERSON: ed! what are you doing here? 
MRS. THOMERSON: ed... you're kinky!
MR. THOMERSON: the phone made me do it!
MRS. THOMERSON: you've been having strange sex...!

COLE: she's mine!
RICK: he's kidnapped her! everyone into the bus!

COLE: he and debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. fourteen movie theaters under one roof. prominent is a sign which reads: "24 hour 3d festival!" cole drags debbie into one of the theaters. the gang runs up to the theaters. 
RICK: fan out and look for them.

MAN: gee, what a realistic effect. 
WOMAN: yeah, like you're in the movie with them.
PATRON: best 3d i've ever seen.

RICK: are you okay? 
DEBBIE: yeah.
RICK: this has been quite a night. here's a thought. why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?

LARRY: how'd you get here?
SUE: rick called me.
LARRY: why don't we go someplace and talk.

FATHER FALWELL: now, before i pronounce you man and wife, the groom wishes to recite his vow to debbie. richard. 
THOMERSONS: they fear the worst.
MR. THOMERSON: oh, almighty.
RICK: he turns to debbie. he waits a beat and begins.
RICK: cheese. i love you more than cheese. and i love cheese a lot.
THOMERSONS: they hide their faces in their hands. off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean. the wind begins to pick up. undaunted, rick continues his soliloquy.
RICK: in fact, more than dairy products in general. i love dairy. my love is cream. pour me on the cereal of your life...

RICK: i think this song pretty much sums up the way i feel at this moment. 
FATHER FALWELL: i now pronounce you man and wife. goodbye.
