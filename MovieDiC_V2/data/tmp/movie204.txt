speaker1: and how are you today, sir? 
speaker2: real good now. i'm checking in - mr. anderson.
speaker1: okay, mr. anderson, and you're still planning on staying with us just the night, then?
speaker3: you bet.

speaker1: - whether they will go to summer camp at all. katie jensen has more. 
speaker2: it was supposed to be a project funded by the city council; it was supposed to benefit those fargo-moorehead children who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend a lakeshore summer camp. but nobody consulted city controller stu jacobson...

speaker1: can i warm that up for ya there? 
speaker2: you bet.

speaker1: i'm, uh, jerry lundegaard - 
speaker2: you're jerry lundegaard?
speaker3: yah, shep proudfoot said -
speaker2: shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
speaker3: shep said 8:30.
speaker2: we been sitting here an hour.
speaker3: i'm sure sorry. i - shep told me 8:30. it was a mix-up, i guess.
speaker2: ya got the car?
speaker3: yah, you bet. it's in the lot there. brand-new burnt umber ciera.
speaker2: yeah, okay. well, siddown then. i'm carl showalter and this is my associate gaear grimsrud.
speaker3: yah, how ya doin'. so, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
speaker2: sure, jerry, we're all set. why wouldn't we be?
speaker3: yah, no, i'm sure you are. shep vouched for you and all. i got every confidence in you fellas.
speaker3: ... so i guess that's it, then.
speaker4: no, that's not it, jerry.
speaker3: huh?
speaker4: the new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
speaker3: yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. i thought shep told you -
speaker4: shep didn't tell us much, jerry.
speaker3: well, okay, it's -
speaker4: except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
speaker3: yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
speaker4: yeah, you already said that.
speaker3: yah. but it's not a whole pay- in-advance deal. i give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
speaker4: i'm not gonna debate you, jerry.
speaker3: okay.
speaker4: i'm not gonna sit here and debate. i will say this though: what shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
speaker3: oh, no, it's real sound. it's all worked out.
speaker4: you want your own wife kidnapped?
speaker3: yah.
speaker4: ... you - my point is, you pay the ransom - what eighty thousand bucks? - i mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. it's like robbing peter to play paul, it doesn't make any -
speaker3: okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. the thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. now, i'm in a bit of trouble -
speaker4: what kind of trouble are you in, jerry?
speaker3: well, that's, that's, i'm not go inta, inta - see, i just need money. now, her dad's real wealthy -
speaker4: so why don't you just ask him for the money?
speaker5: or your wife, you know.
speaker4: or your wife, jerry.
speaker3: well, it's all just part of this - they don't know i need it, see. okay, so there's that. and even if they did, i wouldn't get it. so there's that on top, then. see, these're personal matters.
speaker4: personal matters.
speaker3: yah. personal matters that needn't, uh -
speaker4: okay, jerry. you're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, it, let's take a look at that ciera.

speaker4: but the deal's already done, i already got the money -
speaker5: yeah, but we have an audit here, i just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
speaker4: yah, well, they exist all right.
speaker5: i'm sure they do - ha ha! but i can't read their serial numbers here. so if you could read me -

speaker5: no, fax is no good, that's what i have and i can't read the darn thing -
speaker4: yah, okay, i'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
speaker5: okay, because if i can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then i gotta call back that money -
speaker4: yah, how much money was that?
speaker5: three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. see, i gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
speaker4: yah, no problem, i'll just fax that over to ya, then.

speaker3: stan and i're okay.
speaker1: yah.
speaker3: we're good to loan in.
speaker1: yah.

speaker1: no, but, wade, see, i was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. it's my deal here, see?
speaker2: jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
speaker1: yah, right -
speaker2: you're sayin' - what're you sayin'?
speaker3: you're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
speaker1: no, no. i - i'd, i'd - pay you back the principal, and interest - heck, i'd go - one over prime -
speaker2: we're not a bank, jerry.
speaker3: what the heck, jerry, if i wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand i'd go to midwest federal. talk to bill diehl.
speaker2: he's at norstar.
speaker3: he's at -
speaker1: no, see, i don't need a finder's fee, i need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. i need the principal.
speaker2: jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
speaker3: what the heck were you thinkin'? heck, if i'm only gettin' bank interest, i'd look for complete security. heck, fdic. i don't see nothin' like that here.
speaker1: yah, but i - okay, i would, i'd guarantee ya your money back.
speaker3: i'm not talkin' about your word, jerry. geez, what the heck're you?... well, look, i don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal. i assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.

speaker2: certainly -
speaker3: can i see your license and registration please?
speaker2: certainly.
speaker2: ... i was gonna tape up the temporary tag, ya know, to be in full compliance, but it, uh, it, uh ... must a slipped my mind...

speaker3: what's this, sir?
speaker2: that's my license and regis- tration. i wanna be in compliance.
speaker2: ... i was just thinking i could take care of it right here. in brainerd.

speaker2: uh-huh.
speaker1: so he says, 'so i get it, so you think i'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
speaker2: i unnerstand.
speaker1: and then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. so i don't say nothin' and he says, 'what do ya think about that?' so i says, 'well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
speaker2: ya got that right.
speaker1: and he says, 'yah, that guy's dead and i don't mean a old age.' and then he says, 'geez, i'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
speaker2: white bear lake?
speaker1: well, ecklund andand swedlin's, that's closer ta moose lake, so i made that assumption.
speaker2: oh sure.
speaker1: so, ya know, he's drinkin', so i don't think a whole great deal of it, but mrs. mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought i should call it in, so i called it in. end a story.
speaker2: what'd this guy look like anyways?
speaker1: oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny-lookin'.
speaker2: uh-huh - in what way?
speaker1: just a general way.
speaker2: okay, well, thanks a bunch, mr. mohra. you're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.

speaker1: okay, are you sure, cause, i mean, how do you know? because, see, the crime i'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. and they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
