ANDERSON: you bet.

NEWS ANCHOR: - whether they will go to summer camp at all. katie jensen has more. 
KATIE: it was supposed to be a project funded by the city council; it was supposed to benefit those fargo-moorehead children who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend a lakeshore summer camp. but nobody consulted city controller stu jacobson...

WAITRESS: can i warm that up for ya there? 
ANDERSON: you bet.

ANDERSON: i'm, uh, jerry lundegaard - 
YOUNGER MAN: you're jerry lundegaard?
JERRY: yah, shep proudfoot said -
YOUNGER MAN: shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
JERRY: shep said 8:30.
YOUNGER MAN: we been sitting here an hour.
JERRY: i'm sure sorry. i - shep told me 8:30. it was a mix-up, i guess.
YOUNGER MAN: ya got the car?
JERRY: yah, you bet. it's in the lot there. brand-new burnt umber ciera.
YOUNGER MAN: yeah, okay. well, siddown then. i'm carl showalter and this is my associate gaear grimsrud.
JERRY: yah, how ya doin'. so, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
YOUNGER MAN: sure, jerry, we're all set. why wouldn't we be?
JERRY: yah, no, i'm sure you are. shep vouched for you and all. i got every confidence in you fellas.
JERRY: ... so i guess that's it, then.
CARL: no, that's not it, jerry.
JERRY: huh?
CARL: the new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
JERRY: yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. i thought shep told you -
CARL: shep didn't tell us much, jerry.
JERRY: well, okay, it's -
CARL: except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
JERRY: yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
CARL: yeah, you already said that.
JERRY: yah. but it's not a whole pay- in-advance deal. i give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
CARL: i'm not gonna debate you, jerry.
JERRY: okay.
CARL: i'm not gonna sit here and debate. i will say this though: what shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
JERRY: oh, no, it's real sound. it's all worked out.
CARL: you want your own wife kidnapped?
JERRY: yah.
CARL: ... you - my point is, you pay the ransom - what eighty thousand bucks? - i mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. it's like robbing peter to play paul, it doesn't make any -
JERRY: okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. the thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. now, i'm in a bit of trouble -
CARL: what kind of trouble are you in, jerry?
JERRY: well, that's, that's, i'm not go inta, inta - see, i just need money. now, her dad's real wealthy -
CARL: so why don't you just ask him for the money?
GRIMSRUD: or your wife, you know.
CARL: or your wife, jerry.
JERRY: well, it's all just part of this - they don't know i need it, see. okay, so there's that. and even if they did, i wouldn't get it. so there's that on top, then. see, these're personal matters.
CARL: personal matters.
JERRY: yah. personal matters that needn't, uh -
CARL: okay, jerry. you're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, it, let's take a look at that ciera.

GARY: i unnerstand.
MAN: and then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. so i don't say nothin' and he says, 'what do ya think about that?' so i says, 'well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
GARY: ya got that right.
