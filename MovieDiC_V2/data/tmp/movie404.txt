MR. BIXLER: the great way, is not difficult for those 
GUY: i got one. he gets up
GUY#2: that's not funny, his poem is about futility, we toil in unrewarded obscurity.
MR. BIXLER: now, i hear judgment, let's not forget the part about the open heart...
VADA: i paid the money.
MR. BIXLER: for this class?
VADA: uh huh, i wanna be a writer.

MR. BIXLER: welcome to the class, go find a seat. the class applauds okay ahh, who's next?
RONDA: i experienced something with my boyfriend the other day, and i wrote a few words down.
MR. BIXLER: the floor's yours ronda.
RONDA: he covers me like a blanket, from the cold, dark night, as i look into his eyes, i know it's right, to touch, to feel, i know he's real, flesh all a mush, flesh all a mush, i can't fight it, there's no point, i wake up in lighter joint.
MR. BIXLER: uhhh, va, uhh, vada.
VADA: i wrote a poem too.
MR. BIXLER: please.
VADA: loads of ice-cream by vada sultenfuss
JUSTIN: i hear that vada, flesh all a mush or rocky road, it's about desire.
MR. BIXLER: vada that's... it's very sweet, and it rhymes and that's also good but, you're not expressing to me what's in your soul. i want you to show me how you see the world, your fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.
VADA'S THOUGHTS: my fears and secrets. i'm afraid i killed my mother.

HARRY: can not do without, harry's wild about me. 
SHELLY: excuse me harry, i'm sorry, i just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. and the room's all set up.
HARRY: thanks, listen i wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about vada, i was a little harsh.
SHELLY: i shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. it's just that i like vada, very much.
HARRY: after my wife died, grammoo moved in here to help take care of vada. they were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, vada's been acting kinda crazy. i'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
SHELLY: i'm sure she will.

THOMAS J: nothing's biting today. 
VADA: maybe they had a big breakfast.
THOMAS J: i'm gonna be an acrobat when i grow up.
VADA: big deal, i can do that too. thomas j, you got something!
THOMAS J: oh no!

VADA: hurry! 
THOMAS J: i'm trying.
VADA: reel it in. he's only tiny, throw him back.
THOMAS J: i don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it? thomas j puts his foot on the fish and pulls

VADA: ouch! darn hook!
VADA: i'm bleeding, did he get away? go look.
THOMAS J: yeah he got away. come on let's go.
VADA: hey, we can become blood brothers.
THOMAS J: naah, i don't wanna.
VADA: you could pick that scab on your arm.
THOMAS J: it's a mosquito bite.
VADA: it'll bleed.
THOMAS J: if i do it, can we go?
VADA: uh huh.
THOMAS J: okay, ow!
VADA: okay, rub them together.
VADA: now we're blood brothers for life.

SHELLY: hi. 
HARRY: oh hi, what can i do for you?
SHELLY: nothing, i was just wondering what you were doing.
HARRY: oh, i'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
SHELLY: oh right, right, . bader lorenzo died june 22 1972 devoted husband to nicolette. cherished father of babritzio and heidi, in lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
HARRY: i wrote that.
SHELLY: no kidding?
SHELLY: oh it's good, "in lieu of" i love that word lieu.
HARRY: i prefer it to "instead", it has more dignity.
SHELLY: in lieu... "instead".... no contest.
HARRY: it's no big deal.
SHELLY: you have to learn how to take a complement. movies, movies, ahhhh, "love story" at the drive in, i cried my eyes out, did you see it?
HARRY: i haven't been to the movies in ages.
SHELLY: i love going to movies, especially at the drive in. i don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in. i'll let you get back to work.
HARRY: i do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
SHELLY: okay.

SHELLY: hi vada. 
VADA: are you going out somewhere?
SHELLY: no.
VADA: so how come you're putting lipstick on?
SHELLY: a girl's always gotta look her best.
VADA: i think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
SHELLY: have you ever tried any?
VADA: no.
SHELLY: come here, sit down.
SHELLY: now, first we blot.
SHELLY: take a look. i think it looks real nice on you. vada looks in shelly's mirror
VADA: shelly, do you think i'm pretty?
SHELLY: yes, vada i think you're very pretty. you've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
VADA: the boys at school don't think i am.
SHELLY: they'll come around. close your eyes, i wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. the first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
VADA: do you like putting makeup on people?
SHELLY: uh huh, i've been trying to get out to
VADA: shelly, i would definitely hold off on that hollywood thing.

THOMAS J: your lip bleeding? 
VADA: no.
THOMAS J: what's wrong with your eyes?
VADA: a girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
THOMAS J: where's your bike?
VADA: oh, in the garage. walk me over.
VADA: it's only a garage, come on.
VADA: hey, one of my streamers is gone! it probably fell off in here. thomas j walks over to a model of a head
THOMAS J: hey look at this!
VADA: that was grammoo's. it's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. come here, i'll diagnose your head.
THOMAS J: no, i don't wanna.
VADA: come on, it's fun.
VADA: hmmmm, interesting.
THOMAS J: what?
VADA: you have no personality.
THOMAS J: hey, where does it say that?
VADA: never mind.
THOMAS J: is that your dad?
VADA: yes.
THOMAS J: who's that with your dad?
VADA: it's my mother.
THOMAS J: do you remember her?
VADA: no. grammoo said she's in heaven.
THOMAS J: what do you think it's like?
VADA: what?
THOMAS J: heaven.
VADA: i think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
THOMAS J: but, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
VADA: it doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
THOMAS J: that doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.

HIS DATE WITH SHELLY: the tune "moonglow" is playing on the radio 
PHIL: well well well, what's going on in here?
HARRY: nothing, i'm dressing.
PHIL: oh, you're dressing, uh huh, harry harry harry harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother? phil then proceeds to give harry a noogie

PHIL: oh yes, oh that's great. 
HARRY: i'm very nervous.
PHIL: why?
HARRY: the last date i had was twenty years ago.
PHIL: that's true. harry harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, "the sexual revolution", now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing?

HARRY: oh come on. 
PHIL: harry, i'm serious, trust me harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every tom and harry.
HARRY: are you sure about all this?
PHIL: did you not tell vada i'm a womanizer huh?
HARRY: oh, i'm running late. shelly'll be here any minute.
PHIL: oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
HARRY: no, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. how do i look?
PHIL: like a sultenfuss. go get 'em.
HARRY: goodnight vada.
VADA: dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
HARRY: ahh, i just wanna look nice.
VADA: you never cared before.
HARRY: well shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
VADA: why?
HARRY: she likes to play bingo.
VADA: can i go too?
HARRY: naah, i think you'd better stay here and keep grammoo company.

THOMAS J: vada? vada?? where are you?? 
VADA: here.
THOMAS J: don't do that!!
VADA: sorry.
THOMAS J: what do you want? my mom will skin me alive if she finds i'm out here.
VADA: let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
THOMAS J: i told you i'll get in trouble.
VADA: pacifist!
THOMAS J: i am not.
VADA: bed wetter!
THOMAS J: i stopped that!

HARRY: don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. for instance, on a given night anybody can win, but i play the odds, when choosing bingo cards, i use a range of theories from the laws of probability to avoiding duplicate number systems. this way you get much more activity. 
SHELLY: does it make it easier to win?
HARRY: no. just, more activity.
HARRY: hi carl.
OUTSIDE THE CHURCH NIGHT: vada and thomas j are walking up to the church
THOMAS J: they're not gonna let us in vada, we're kids.
VADA: we're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
THOMAS J: watch bingo? i don't even like to play bingo.
VADA: duck!
SHELLY: oh great!
THOMAS J: hey there's your dad and shelly.
VADA: ssshhhhh, i don't want them to see me.
SHELLY: aarrggh.

SHELLY: i just had a terrible thought harry. 
HARRY: what's that?
SHELLY: i'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
HARRY: why d'you think these seats were empty.

THOMAS J: can we go yet? 
VADA: go???
THOMAS J: you know i'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.

SHELLY: oh, i'm just not lucky harry. 
HARRY: look, it's not always luck, i mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
SHELLY: kinda like men.
HARRY: oh, how do you mean?
SHELLY: you can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.

CARL: there was no bingo, it came from outside. 
VERNON: how could someone outside get a bingo?
CARL: someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone outside yelled bingo you
VERNON: who are you calling a mowon?
VERNON'S WIFE: put a lid on it vernon!
CARL: put a lid on it?? if you weren't 200 years old, i'd kick your wrinkled arse!!
HARRY: hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game. meanwhile, shelly has found it all rather amusing

SHELLY: i had a good time tonight. 
HARRY: i haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
SHELLY: would you like to come in and see my house? just for a minute.
HARRY: okay, sure.

SHELLY: home sweet home. 
HARRY: it's nice.
SHELLY: i did it myself. i read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
HARRY: well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
SHELLY: you can look in the bathroom if you want. people are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
HARRY: yeah.
SHELLY: are you mad at me?
HARRY: no, why?
SHELLY: i don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
HARRY: oh, that was phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. look i'm so out of touch, i haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
SHELLY: what happened to her?
HARRY: ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after vada was born.
SHELLY: did she ever see vada?
HARRY: i brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah i think she saw vada. it was.....
SHELLY: dance with me?
HARRY: here?
SHELLY: this is where we are.
HARRY: is there enough room?
HARRY: i haven't danced in.....
SHELLY: in ages, i know, me neither.
HARRY: rock?
SHELLY: see, you're not that out of touch. you're good.
HARRY: at widdman high i was considered a pretty hot date, i did a killer frugue. shelly smells harry's neck
SHELLY: what are you wearing?
HARRY: old spice, phil says it's a timeless classic. they continue to dance
SHELLY: do you want to?
HARRY: want to what?
SHELLY: kiss me.
HARRY: yes.
SHELLY: good.
SHELLY: good at kissing, and dancing, i'm very optimistic.
HARRY: i ahh, better go.
SHELLY: it's only eight o'clock.
HARRY: goodnight shelly.
SHELLY: goodnight.

SHELLY: well, i guess it's official we had a date, maybe we can play bingo again sometime. 
HARRY: i'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
SHELLY: goodnight.
VADA'S ROOM: vada finishes watching, and goes to bed

MR. BIXLER: before the class started, ronda and justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation. 
WOMAN: ooooh that's really cool.
JUSTIN: okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes out into the group.
RONDA: everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. relax your muscles and take deep breaths.
JUSTIN: now, try to feel what the other person is
RONDA: okay, open your eyes. what did everybody feel?
GUY: i felt mrs. hunsaker's strength.

RONDA: so right on, that's exactly what i sent out, and i felt like, you were full of inner peace and harmony. 
MR. BIXLER: vada, what did you feel.
VADA: i felt justin's hangnail.
JUSTIN: no vada, that's not what we're looking for, a hangnail is insignificant. what's in my soul, feel my aura.
VADA: i don't think i'm allowed to.
JUSTIN: i tell you what, let's try it again, hold hands.
VADA'S THOUGHTS: grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. it got infected and traveled to her vocal chords, it ruined her singing voice, i don't think grammoo thought it was insignificant.

HARRY: lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get lettuce. suddenly shelly appears behind them and calls out 
SHELLY: hey, i thought i recognized you two, hi vada.
VADA: hi.
HARRY: i'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
SHELLY: yeah, me too, mind if i tag along?
HARRY: not at all. lot of potatoes!
SHELLY: it's for shelly's famous potato salad.
HARRY: i'm looking forward to that.
HARRY: hey, ouch, it!! vada, watch what you're doing.
VADA: sorry.
SHELLY: you know this is gonna be my first 4th of july picnic in a long time.
HARRY: really?
VADA: dad, didn't you say you needed prunes real bad?
HARRY: ahh, vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. i don't know what's gotten into her today.
VADA'S THOUGHTS: i used to like to play with my ken and barbie dolls, ken was my favorite. then one christmas i got them a camper, and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves. so i wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff.

PHIL: harry harry harry harry harry, i told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. you've cremated them. 
HARRY: that's what i do. do you wanna do it??
PHIL: no, no no....
HARRY: look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while! phil exits scene, shelly comes up behind harry
SHELLY: how's it going chef?
HARRY: okay.
VADA: are they ready yet?
HARRY: no, sweetie, not yet.
VADA: when?
HARRY: soon honey, soon. shelly again tries to fix up vada's hair and vada shakes her off again
VADA: when??
HARRY: in a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out. vada backs off, followed by shelly

SHELLY: rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay 
HARRY: i'll second that.
VADA: hey shelly, like seafood?
SHELLY: uh huh, why?
VADA: see food!
SHELLY: that's attractive.
SHELLY: oh excuse me...

DANNY: what am i doing here????? what am i doing here?
SHELLY: hi ralph. oh danny, how'd you find me here?
DANNY: you told everybody where you were going, i'm here for the motor home. scene shifts to vada, phil and harry for a moment
PHIL: these two people do not have a good relationship.
SHELLY: i've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
DANNY: excuse me, mutual asset, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be "our mutual asset", not "shelly's recreational vehicle". gimme the keys.
SHELLY: keep your voice down!
DANNY: what?
SHELLY: the boss is watching us...
DANNY: i'm impressed.
SHELLY: i guess i'll have to introduce you now.
DANNY: yeah, all right...
SHELLY: this is harry, phil, grammoo and vada sultenfuss...
DANNY: vada sultenfuss?? tough break.
VADA: i like my name.
SHELLY: this is danny and ralph, they own the dino raphael salon in detroit. we used to be married.
VADA: are you here to take shelly back?
HARRY: uhh, it's nice to meet ya. uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
DANNY: can't stay, i'm just here because my wife.....
SHELLY: ex...ex, ex...
DANNY: my __ex__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
HARRY: shelly?
SHELLY: honestly harry, he got the mustang, i promise.....
DANNY: i don't think so, i got a copy of the property settlement right here. danny pulls out a piece of paper ahh this is my lease...... it, i keep forgetting things, i'm getting senile.
HARRY: danny?

HARRY: okay, i know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but i urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever. 
DANNY: this guy bonking you?
SHELLY: danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
HARRY: look, you're not gonna take shelly's camper.
DANNY: oh.. oh.. oh no?? oh?
HARRY: it's her home! it's where she lives!!
DANNY: oh really, okay fine look, go cook, gimme the goddam keys.
SHELLY: stop it! that hurts!!
HARRY: danny.....

RALPH: what'd you do that for?? 
HARRY: who are you?
RALPH: i'm his brother.
HARRY: oh then you'll probably be visiting us here quite often.

SHELLY: bye ralph. 
SHELLY: well, you were pretty great!
HARRY: is it really your camper?
SHELLY: can we see it from the back yard?
HARRY: you can get the general idea...
HARRY: yep, there they are... they always look the same every year...
SHELLY: pointing upwards look...
HARRY: did you ahh, love him?
SHELLY: i would never marry anybody i didn't love.

VADA: he must like shelly, i never saw him hit anyone in his life. 
PHIL: he likes her.
VADA: does he love her?
PHIL: probably.
VADA: do you like her?
PHIL: yes i do, and i think she's very good for your father.
VADA: why?
PHIL: after your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
VADA: really?
PHIL: now when i see him with shelly, sometimes he seems like the old harry.
VADA: my dad was funny?
PHIL: well he wasn't one of the marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
VADA'S THOUGHTS: my uncle fought in the korean war, he had a steel plate put in his head, daddy said he didn't come back the same, one night, he picked up a radio station from oklahoma in his teeth, it was really neat.

VADA: aaaaaaaaaahhhhh. 
VADA: carnnk yu sheeee ik??

THOMAS J: cool, can i get one for vada?
NURSE RANDALL: oh yes, yes. she gets another one out of her drawer thomas, let me ask you a question. does vada ever tell you why she comes down here so much?
THOMAS J: cause she's dying.
NURSE RANDALL: do you think she is?
THOMAS J: no.
NURSE RANDALL: why do you think she says that?
THOMAS J: cause she gets scared of all those dead
NURSE RANDALL: you know what i think? i think vada's very lucky to have a friend like you. nurse randall hands thomas j another syringe
THOMAS J: she's my best friend.
NURSE RANDALL: miss vada, how are you feeling?

SHELLY: i don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. you know vada you have to watch what you eat here, i remember one time i went to a carnival with my cousins david and frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
VADA: nephritis? it's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
SHELLY: well, i'm no doctor. all i know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. they baffled medical science, they were in a magazine. vada and harry give shelly a "yeah right" look
SHELLY: they were!! "popular mechanics", no "popular science". i don't know, popular.

SHELLY: oh look they're trying to hit that poor thing. 
HARRY: watch you don't knock out a fish.
SHELLY: perfect.

SHELLY: vada? would you like us to get you another goldfish? 
VADA: no!, he's fine.

SHELLY: oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival and not ride the bumper cars. 
HARRY: i fall asleep at the wheel.
VADA: i'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
SHELLY: oh great vada, come on...

THOMAS J: well when you get older, you just have to.
VADA: i'm gonna marry mr. bixler.
THOMAS J: you can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
VADA: it is not.
THOMAS J: yes it is, cause then he'll give you all a's and it won't be fair.
VADA: not true.

MR. BIXLER: i was hoping you'd stop by today.
VADA: i can't stay, i just came to read my poem.
MR. BIXLER: we'd love to hear it.
VADA: weeping willow with your tears running down, why do you always weep and frown, is it because he left you one day, is it because he could not stay, on your branches he would swing, do you long for the happiness that they would bring, he found shelter in your shade, he thought his laughter would never fade, weeping willow stop your tears, there is something to calm your fears, you think death as if you forever part, but i know he'll always be in your heart. there is a long pause as it sinks in, everybody remains

VADA: hi judy. 
JUDY: hi vada.
VADA'S THOUGHTS: things are a little better these days; i finally swallowed that chicken bone, judy and i are gonna be in the same home room and the republican party just re-nominated mr. nixon.
