NED: to some guys, women are like a cheap puzzle... with pieces that just don't fit. they think the soul of a woman is darker than a back alley... more tangled than a telephone cord... and colder than a klondike bar in canada. but those guys don't even have a clue. 
NED: when you know women the way i do, you understand exactly what what makes them tick... what makes them hum... what makes them jiggle up and down when they walk. and it's not the kind of thing you can learn from a correspondence course.

NED: one will take you for a fast ride on a bumpy road with no seat belt. but the other kind... 
ARCH: jeez... knock off the chatter, will ya.
NED: just trying to keep you awake, arch.
ARCH: i'm awake! where do you come up with all that about women?
NED: it's true. women are very complex, but if you know how to read 'em... they're an open book. you can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches.
ARCH: are you kiddin'?
NED: i'd stake my career on it. anybody ever proves me wrong, i'll throw away my badge.
ARCH: aayyhh... women are trouble...
NED: i used to believe that too. until i married lana. now, she... is a peach.
ARCH: yeah, well you're a lucky stiff, pal. ya hold down two jobs. got a beautiful wife waitin' for ya at home. everything a guy could ever want, including no kids.
NED: i'd love to have kids.
ARCH: what?! rug-rats? give me a break! jeez, i hate stakeouts. what makes you think milo's gonna show up here?
NED: logic. he knocked off all those banks. he's got cash. he's gonna want to spend it. this is one of the few places that still takes cash. sooner or later... he's gotta turn up.
ARCH: and how we s'posed to recognize this scumbag?
NED: the "support hose bandit"? when you see him... you'll know him.
ARCH: these are the best nachos in north america. maybe the world!
ARCH: i'm empty. i'm gonna get a refill. you want some?
LOLA: got a light?
NED: sure.
LOLA: how about a match?
NED: no thanks. i have plenty.
LOLA: you really are incredibly stupid, aren't you? i like that in a man.
NED: i'd be insulted, but i know you're serious.
LOLA: you sound so sure of yourself.
NED: i'm not as as i look.
LOLA: let me buy you a drink, mr. uh...
NED: ravine. ned ravine. and you are...?
LOLA: thirsty. what about that drink?
NED: i'm on duty.
LOLA: brain surgeon?
NED: cop.
LOLA: oooo... and i bet you have a big gun.
NED: you lose.
LOLA: if i can't buy you a drink... ...let me buy you one of those.
NED: who can say no to a weiner?
LOLA: not me.
LOLA: two dogs. hot.
NED: you come here often?
LOLA: only when i'm in heat.
NED: oh! sorry.
LOLA: where ya going?
NED: get something to wipe it off.
LOLA: that's okay. you're doing just fine.
NED: i'll get you a wet paper towel.

NED: hold it right there, milo! 
RESTROOM PATRON: look out! he's got a weenie!

NED: you take science in high school, milo? 
MILO: i skipped high school, cop!
NED: then you're probably not familiar with the theory of inverse proportionate explosive dynamics.
MILO: what about it?
NED: if you fire a weapon with the barrel obstructed, the explosive force multiplies by twenty-three point five nine eight and reverses on itself with diametric polarity?
MILO: yeah. so?
NED: the gun will blow up in your hand... and it won't even scorch my pinkie.
MILO: ha! that's just theoretical hypothesis. inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment.
NED: oh yeah. then pull the trigger, smart guy. let's find out.
NED: you have the right to remain silent... next... if you waive that right, anything you say... next...

NED: ...may be used against you in a court of law... next... you have the right to an attorney... do you have an attorney? 
MILO: nahhhh!
NED: then today's your lucky day...
ANGLE - THE BUSINESS CARD: it reads... "ned ravine - defense attorney"

LANA: oh yes, frank! adjust the stroke by ten percent! that's it. now tweak my points. oh yes, oh yes! you got it! stabilize your ball joints and grind my rear differential! now accelerate! floor it! lay rubber, baby! vrrroooooooooommmmmmmmm! 
LANA: not bad for an auto mechanic...
FRANK: yeah, well you're not so bad yourself... for a lawyer's wife...
LANA: better watch your tongue, sweetie, or i'll have my husband arrest you.
FRANK: busy man. cop and a lawyer. when does he ever find time for you?
LANA: he doesn't. that's why i need you to keep my engine tuned, frank. why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod?
FRANK: maybe you should trade him in on a new model.
LANA: i would... if i could make any money on the deal.
FRANK: want to go for another test drive?
LANA: pull over and park it, frank. i'm still under warranty.

NED: morning sweetheart. 
LANA: uh huh. want some coffee?
NED: no thanks.
LANA: frank here was just grabbing a little before going back to work on my car.
NED: how long you been working on lana's mercedes, frank?
FRANK: oh... i don't know... six, seven weeks.
NED: and ya still haven't found the problem?
FRANK: think i got my finger on it though.
NED: i know what he's doing, lana. i wasn't born yesterday. he's not fixing your car. he's you!
NED: you are my wife! i can see what your game is, frank. you open up her hood, poke around in there... squirt some lubrication in... play around with all her parts... then take an old used piston and stick it in... then pull it out... in, out, in, out! every day! there's no end to it. you just keep coming and coming!... and the bill just gets bigger and bigger!
NED: but you don't see it, do you, lana? you're too good... too pure. you can't see the evil in people like him. well, you're not getting away with it, pal. i'm pulling the plug! you're fired!
LANA: ned... don't you have to be somewhere?
NED: you are so naive.
NED: finish your coffee... then get out!
FRANK: who's that?
LANA: just the postman. he always rings twice.
OMIT: sequence omitted from original script.

NED: laura... do you know where...? 
LAURA: right here. the judge decided to skip arraignment and take milo direct to trial. you're six minutes late, but don't sweat it. you got judge allen. he's always eleven minutes late.
LAURA: i suggest you try lemming versus florida, 1956... where the guy jumped in the water and everybody followed.
NED: yeah. good idea.
NED: i don't know what i'd do without you?
LAURA: really?
NED: laura, how long have you worked for me?
LAURA: two years, seven months, twenty-three days, nineteen hours... ...six minutes and fifty-two seconds. ...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty- five... fifty-six...
NED: and when was the last time i gave you a raise?
LAURA: never. but that's okay. i don't need a raise. in fact... i was thinking of giving you a rebate on my salary.
NED: naw. that's okay. you keep it.

LAURA'S HUSBAND: did we forget something? 
LAURA'S HUSBAND: did we forget something?

NED: laura. laura! what is it? 
LAURA: i'm okay, i'm okay. i just get a bit... claustrophobic... in the bathroom.
NED: maybe we should try some prune juice.
LAURA: wear the blue one.
NED: ladies and gentlemen... i ask you... does this look like the face of a crook?

NED: of course it does. but the question of my client's guilt or innocence is not the issue here today. i'm certain every member of the jury can clearly see that he's guilty! 
BLIND JUROR: i can't.

NED: put yourself in his shoes. look through his eyes. see the world the way he sees it! 
NED: things just don't look the same. it's fuzzy... and frightening!

NED: ladies and gentlemen... milo crumley is not the perpetrator here. he is the victim! 
NED: like all of us... this man is the unfortunate victim of these tragically difficult economic times. and what does that mean? he can't support his family! ned motions toward the gallery, where we see...
NED: for sake!... he can't even support his own face! judge allen notices that milo is chewing gum.
JUDGE ALLEN: mr. crumley... you cannot chew gum in my courtroom... unless you have enough for everyone.
JUDGE ALLEN: bailiff. pass these out.
JUDGE ALLEN: and don't forget the jury.
NED: and so, desperate and broke, with no other options before him, mr. crumley went to eleven savings and loans and did what any of you would have done. he stole back the money that the sandls had stolen from him!
JUDGE ALLEN: you're not running for congress here, so knock off the speeches and quit inciting these brainless morons! now pick up the pace and wrap this son- of-a-bitch up! call your first witness.
NED: i call... detective ned ravine.
BAILIFF: do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
NED: i do.
NED: detective ravine, at the time of the arrest, did you read the defendant his miranda rights?
NED: of course. that's standard procedure.
NED: are these the cards officer brooks used to prompt you while reading mr. crumley his rights?
NED: yeah. these are them.
NED: reading from the cards now... quote "you have the right to remain silent, if you waive that right, anything you say... may be used against you in a court of law." is that right?
NED: that's right.
NED: wrong! the official miranda warning is... "anything you say can be used against you in a court of law." not "may"... "can!" don't you know the difference between "can" and "may", detective? every school kid knows "can" is a verb that indicates ability to perform, while "may" is a verbal auxiliary indicating the permission to act.
NED: i didn't have time to worry about past participles or interrogative pronouns! i was trying to protect society from a deranged madman! but this ivy league fop...!!!
NED: i have no more use for this witness.
JUDGE ALLEN: mr. ravine...
JUDGE ALLEN: i'm dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar.
NED: ow!
PROSECUTOR: but your honor...!
JUDGE ALLEN: i know, i know. it's a technicality. but it's the kind of technicality that makes the american legal system what it is today! court's adjourned!

LOLA: i waited. you never came back. 
NED: i got busy. here's that paper towel i promised.
LOLA: thanks...
NED: how'd you get in? the door was locked.
LOLA: it's miraculous what a real woman can do... with a bobbie pin.
LOLA: cigarette?
NED: no... thanks. they're bad for ya.
LOLA: yes, i know. i like things that are bad for me. so... i hear you go both ways.
NED: only once. it was a fraternity prank. i never saw him again.
LOLA: no, i mean... you're a cop and a lawyer.
NED: oh. yeah. well, there's a lot of scum out there on the streets... but they all deserve a fair and costly trial.
LAURA: i'll get that.
NED: oh... laura... this is, uh...
LOLA: lola cain.
NED: gotta keep these darn books in their right place or we'll never find the ones we need. let's see, q thru m... r thru b... w thru f...
LAURA: it's getting late. i'll give you a ride home, ned. finished with the books, ned turns... smiles.
NED: i have my car.
LAURA: i'll tow you.
NED: not today. you don't need to wait. i'll see you tomorrow.
LAURA: i should call someone to fix this...
NED: tomorrow...
LAURA: i'll call from home.
LOLA: i think i should warn you, mr. ravine... i'm not wearing any underwear.
NED: try these on.
NED: so... what can i do for you?
LOLA: i've run across some... papers... and i thought you might be able to tell me what they are. you see, i'm not very experienced when it comes to... papers.
NED: i'll help you miss cain, if i'm able. do you have the... papers... here?
LOLA: no... they're at home. i thought you might stop by...
NED: i'm on duty tonight.
LOLA: don't they ever give you a night off?
NED: yeah. tomorrow.
LOLA: i'll let you know where.
NED: what's wrong with my office?
LOLA: nothing a good interior decorator couldn't fix.

FRANK: i came back for my shower cap. 
LANA: yeah, well you came to the right place.
LANA: sit down.
FRANK: where is he?
LANA: on duty all night. by the time he wraps up his reports, it'll be close to noon tomorrow.
LANA: i was just reading over...
LANA: take off the hat, frank.
LANA: i was just reading over my husband's insurance policies. you wouldn't know anything about insurance, would you, frankie?
FRANK: yeah, matter of fact, i sell policies part-time. i got half a brain... or didn't you notice?
LANA: i musta had my eye on something else. how about a translation.
FRANK: standard accident policy... all the usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. the face value is... wow. not bad. three million bucks! and there's a triple indemnity rider.
LANA: meaning?
FRANK: aw, it's just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium. if the policy holder dies under very specific conditions, it pays off three times the face value of the policy.
LANA: nine million dollars...?
FRANK: yeah... but it's a sure bet for the company. nobody ever collects.
LANA: why not?
FRANK: well, like here... it only pays off if he's shot with a pistol, falls from a moving northbound train and drowns in a fresh water stream.
LANA: all three?
FRANK: see what i mean, sweetheart? what are the odds of that?
LANA: it could happen. suppose it did happen?
FRANK: then you'd be rich.
LANA: then we'd be rich.
FRANK: what're you sayin'...?
LANA: we're gonna kill the and i know exactly how! he has a legal symposium in santa barbara this weekend... all we have to do is get him to take the train up instead of driving.
FRANK: how we gonna do that? didn't you tell me he hates trains?
LANA: that's where you come in, baby. you're gonna rig his car so it doesn't work. that should be no problem for you.
LANA: then... we give him a lift to the train station... through dealey plaza, past the book suppository and around the grassy knoll...
FRANK: isn't that out of our way?
LANA: move, frank.
LANA: and pay attention.
LANA: ten minutes out of the station he'll be standing in the vestibule between cars... trying to avoid a panic attack. fourteen minutes and ten seconds out, the train crosses the santa ynez river. so at thirteen minutes and fifty-four seconds, i shoot him, shove him out the door... he hits the river and drowns. bingo! a triple play. we're rich!
FRANK: you been thinking about this a lot, haven't you?
LANA: no. it just came to me. i had this image of a big, powerful, throbbing train... plunging into a long, dark, wet tunnel.

NED: stand over there and shut up! 
GANG MEMBER #1: hey, man, we got rights! don't you be layin' no deleterious malfeasance on us.
NED: watch your mouth, punk! i don't want to hear language like that!
ARCH: whoa, hold on, hoss! take it easy. you seem a little tense tonight. what is it?
NED: aw... i don't know. i guess it's lana. it's just... i know she wants to have a baby so bad...
NED: ...but i never get to spend any time with her. and when i am home... it's like she's, you know... avoiding sex.
GANG MEMBER #1: you should try to be more sensitive, man. more romantic. bring her flowers.
GANG MEMBER #1: try to understand how she feels. after all...
GANG MEMBER #1: she may be weary... women do get weary... wearing that same old shabby dress... but when she's weary... try a little ten-der-ness...
NED: that can't be it. i'm the tenderest guy on the force. nah... i think she's just afraid she won't be able to get pregnant.
ARCH: what's to be afraid! it's like making breakfast! you bring home the bacon... she's got the eggs. ya scramble it up. ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! she's got an omelette in the oven! why don't you knock off early... go home. it'd be nice for lana to wake up in the morning and find you there for a change.
NED: naw... i can't. i got all this paperwork.
ARCH: don't worry about that.
GANG MEMBER #1: we'll do our own paperwork, man!
OTHER GANG MEMBERS: yeah! we'll fill out all that

LAURA: my ned... you look like you were hit by a bus. 
NED: i was. who's in my office?
LAURA: max shady's mother.
NED: not again.

NED: hello, mrs. shady. 
NED: laura... check on my insurance. make sure it's paid up.
MRS. SHADY: good idea, mr. ravine. my son, max, is getting out of prison tomorrow.
NED: gee, has it been seven years already?
MRS. SHADY: seven long, miserable years in the slammer. and he's a bit off.
NED: well, being locked in a tiny room with no tv can make a guy feel pretty tense.
MRS. SHADY: i'm very concerned about him, mr. ravine. he said you were a two-bit shyster... and he's going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling ball!
NED: i'm sure the experience wasn't all negative. he probably made a lot of friends...
MRS. SHADY: you think?
NED: ...learned a useful trade...
MRS. SHADY: oh yes... live autopsies...
NED: ...caught up on all those books he wanted to read...
MRS. SHADY: maybe so... but he said he's going to punch you in the testicles...
MRS. SHADY: ...smash your face...
MRS. SHADY: ...and decimate your wardrobe.
MRS. SHADY: and i wouldn't want that to happen. he's a naughty naughty boy. i just thought i should warn you.
MRS. SHADY: bye for now. oh... may i have a cookie?
LAURA: sure.
MRS. SHADY: thank yooooooooou.
LAURA: oh my ned.
NED: i hate when she comes to see me.
LAURA: don't you realize, ned?... you could be in real danger.
NED: what's that?
LAURA: extreme peril. you know, the risk of personal bodily harm.
NED: no... i mean that.
LAURA: your insurance file. but the policy's missing. did you take it home?
NED: i don't think so.
LAURA: oh, wait a second...

NED: laura! are you alright? that was a very long flashback you had. 
LAURA: yes... i know. it's okay. i'm just a little... pre-menstrual.
LAURA: that lola cain... "person"... stopped by. she left this!

NED: oh yeah, before i forget... you asked me to take care of this. 
LOLA: thanks...
NED: you smoke too much. it's hot tonight.
LOLA: is it? i never know. my body heat runs about twenty degrees above normal.
NED: maybe we should look for a cooler place.
LOLA: i doubt we'll find one. even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days. they keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night. i go out there expecting to find a cool breeze... but it's just a lot of hot air.
NED: what're they lookin' at?
LOLA: a lot of them have tried that seat. you're the first one's lasted this long.
NED: i feel honored.
LOLA: don't. it's broken.
NED: did you bring the... papers?
LOLA: no. i thought you might come over...
NED: sure. i'll drive you.
LOLA: i brought my own car.
NED: i'll follow you then.
LOLA: i know it sounds silly, but would you leave first... wait in your car? i come here a lot and i wouldn't want those men to think i'm "easy"... a who'll jump into bed with anyone at the drop of a hat. but if you leave first...
NED: ...they'll think i'm a putz for passing up a sure thing.
LOLA: now leave me alone!

NED: well, here we are... in the dark. 
LOLA: i have the clapper.
NED: you what?

LOLA: my wind chimes. 
NED: you know, these would work a lot better if you took them out of the boxes.
LOLA: well well... i guess you have been around. i'm impressed.
NED: why don't we take a look at those... papers?
LOLA: papers. right.

NED: that's it? these are the... papers? 
LOLA: yes. they're so confusing to me. can you tell me what they are?
NED: this one's a laundry receipt... and the other one's an expired lottery ticket.
LOLA: no. you keep them... as a memento of our time together.
LOLA: i'm so grateful. how can i ever repay you for all you've done?
NED: cash would be nice.
LOLA: isn't there some other way?
NED: i suppose you could wash my car.
LOLA: no, i mean, isn't there something else you want? something i could give you?
NED: hey... slow down... there's a speed limit in this state. sixty-five miles an hour.
LOLA: how fast was i going, officer?
NED: oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.
LOLA: suppose you pull me over and frisk me?
NED: suppose i let you off with a warning?
LOLA: suppose i find a cop with a bigger nightstick?
NED: suppose i put you under arrest for being a bad girl with bad thoughts?
LOLA: suppose you handcuff me to the bed?
NED: suppose i do and then we lose the key and while i'm gone to get a duplicate made the house catches on fire and i can't get back to save you because the bridge is washed out and so you die a horrible death toasted like a polish sausage on a flaming spit! nah... i better be going.

LOLA: you're not so tough. last chance. 
NED: no thanks. i got a cold shower and a wife who trusts me waiting at home.
LOLA: what's the matter? don't you want me? it's the way i look, isn't it?
NED: don't forget to lock up.
LOLA: i knew you'd come back...
NED: i forgot my car keys.
LOLA: that's not what you came back for.
NED: yes it is.

REPORTER #1: mr. shady! what's the first thing you're gonna do now that you're out? 
MAX SHADY: find ned ravine... rip his head off and use it for a bowling ball!
REPORTER #2: are you a good bowler?
REPORTER #3: you ever bowled a three-hundred game?
REPORTER #4: how would you handle a seven-ten split?
REPORTER #1: say, aren't you wearing one of ravine's "trademark" blue suits?
MAX SHADY: yeah. the gave it to me as a gift... to make up for losing my case. now i'm going to wear it to his friggin' funeral!!
MAX SHADY: ma!

NED: that's madam butterfly, isn't it? 
LOLA: iron butterfly. in-a-gadda-da-vida.
NED: oh yeah, sure... now i can hear it.
LOLA: it tells the sad story of a woman who is rejected by her lover after a brief, but torrid, affair... so she stalks him with an ice pick and stabs him with it more than a thousand times.
NED: really? i never could understand the lyrics.
NED: you know, what happened last night was very, uh...
LOLA: yes... it was. i should check on my homeowners insurance.
NED: but we can't ever let it happen again. ever!
LOLA: what are you saying, ned? that you're rejecting me, your lover, after a brief, but torrid, affair?!
NED: i wouldn't put it exactly like that. it's just that... well, i'm married to a wonderful woman... who is very, very attractive... ...not that you aren't very attractive!

CLERK: don't touch anything. you bond with it... you buy it. whatdya want? 
NED: i'd like to buy a pet.
CLERK: yeah. for what purpose?
NED: it's a gift... for my wife.
CLERK: right. they all say that.
NED: she spends a lot of time alone. i thought it might be nice if she had something to keep her company.
CLERK: yeah. sure. i bet. how do i know you're not the kind of guy who punches out parakeets? or takes some poor defenseless animal, throws it in a sack and runs over it with your car five or six times.
NED: i would never hurt an animal.
CLERK: boy, i would. they're driving me
CLERK: shuddup!
CLERK: okay... tell me more about this broad you're married to. i like to match people with the pets they deserve.

ARCH: uh-uh. 
NED: you do all my paperwork?
NED: get out of here.
ARCH: and a good job, too. one of 'em even did it in spanish.
ARCH: hey ned! catch this! friend of yours.
MAX: ...i'd like to reach down ned ravine's throat and pull out his guts with my bare hands!
ARCH: jesus... you hear that?
NED: he's just working through his anger, trying to find a constructive outlet.
ARCH: are you kiddin'! he'll do it! the guy's a friggin' looney!
NED: trust me, i spent a lot of time with him when i was preparing his case. he's really a very sweet, sensitive human being.
MAX: i'd like to mash his head like a ripe melon...
NED: he gets a little melon-dramatic.
MAX: ...then cut off all his fingers and rip out his liver with my teeth!
NED: see. loves to exaggerate.
ARCH: christ, ned... you're in deep
NED: lieutenant ravine.
LOLA: i want to see you, ned.

NED: i told you not to call me! it's finished between us. no. no, i'm not sucking anything of yours anymore! it's done! over! 
NED: wrong number.

FRANK: how come we gotta meet here? 
LANA: we have to be careful now. we can't risk being seen together at the house or someone might connect us to the murder later on.
LANA: here... put this on.
LANA: speak yiddish.
FRANK: what?
LANA: red yiddish.
FRANK: ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der nisht geshtoigen un nisht gefloygen.
LANA: zein nisht azoy meshige! der plan iz kosher vi yosher.

FRANK: oy! mir vellen zein oif groise tsures. me'vet unz chap'n.
OLDER GENTLEMAN: there's very little risk involved. statistics reveal that less than thirty-two percent of all murderers are ever apprehended.
LANA: you speak yiddish?
OLDER GENTLEMAN: no. but i can read sub-titles.
SUB-TITLE: oy vay!

LAURA: oh gee, you shouldn't have... 
NED: i didn't. it's for my wife.
LAURA: she called. wondered why you never came home last night. i told her you were working with a client, undercover.
LAURA: were you?
NED: what?
LAURA: there's lipstick on your collar.
NED: no there isn't.
LAURA: no... there isn't. but you answered my question. she's a real looker, huh?
NED: who?
LAURA: lola cain.
NED: i hadn't noticed.
LAURA: yeah, i noticed how you hadn't noticed. that's alright. she noticed enough for both of us.
LAURA: i worry about you, ned. i worry a lot. max shady's been faxing death threats to you all morning.
NED: ...stick a knife in your... ...rip the eyeballs out of your... ...drive razor-sharp spikes under your...
LAURA: did you get to the one...?
NED: ...cut it off... shove it in a blender.
LAURA: yeah... that one.
NED: he's just getting it out of his system. once they say it... they never do it. you know... like the president.
LAURA: wait. it might be him.
NED: where did you get that?
LAURA: from my purse.
NED: what are you doing with it?
LAURA: handing it to you.
NED: jeez, laura, what do you use a gun for?
LAURA: you shoot it. a bullet comes out. gosh, ned, after all your years as a cop, i'd think you'd know these things.
NED: laura... put the gun away.
DELIVERY MAN: flowers for ned rav... hey... aren't you that lawyer guy? man, you are dead meat!
LAURA: is this another sick joke from max shady?
NED: what is it...?
LAURA: lola cain.
LAURA: i'll put these in water for you.

LOLA'S VOICE: ned, darling... i know this seems like a strange way to talk with you... but since you won't take my calls, i have no other choice. watch it! that red car's turning left! 
LOLA'S VOICE: i love you, ned. we're meant to be together... forever. the light's changing! floor it! go! go! go!
LOLA'S VOICE: nice move! nothing can keep us apart, ned. not even your wife. i'd hate to have to tell her about us, but if necessary... i will.

LANA: what happened to you last night? 
NED: why? what have you heard?
LANA: you could have called. but then, i suppose you were tied up.
NED: only part of the time.
LANA: i never know when you're coming home, ned. how can i ever make any plans?
NED: i promise i'll spend more time with you. i know it's been rough, being alone so much. but i'll make it up to you. maybe we should try again, you know... to have a baby.
LANA: so what's in the box?
NED: oh... i brought you a present!
LANA: what is it?
NED: it's... sorta like a cat.
LANA: not enough like a cat.
NED: it's a little skunk. i got it at birds-and-skunks-r-us.

NED: so... what're you going to name him? 
LANA: how about... ned?
NED: yeah. got a nice ring to it. i've always liked the name ned.
LANA: no kidding.
NED: so whatdya think? you love ned junior as much as you love me?
LANA: at least.
THE ADJOINING ROOM: ...to answer the phone.
LANA: hello?... hello?... hello? frank? is that you?

LOLA: who's frank? 
NED: frank? the only frank i know is an auto mechanic... but i sure as wouldn't recommend the guy. he's really slow.
LOLA: i had to see you, ned. i need to feel your arms around me! i wanna your toes til the nails pop off!
NED: i told you, what happened was a big mistake. a one night stand. it's over. i have a wife...
LOLA: it doesn't matter. she'll know all about us soon anyway. i want you! in my bed... in my arms... in meeeeeee!
LOLA: i got us tickets to see iron butterfly!
NED: i hate opera!

LOLA: why are you running from me? didn't it mean anything to you?... buffing my buns with carnuba wax? come on, neddy-poo. doesn't mr. pokey want to go exploring? 
NED: he's busy right now.
NED: look, i told you... mr. pokey made a big mistake! one lousy mistake in his whole stinkin' life! so why don't you give him a break! besides... he belongs to my wife!

NED: your birthday! today? why didn't you tell me? 
LAURA: it's not important. i just had one last year.
NED: well, i'm taking you out to celebrate!
LAURA: oh no no! it's no big thing. i'll have another one sometime.
NED: i insist. and i want to get you a nice present.
LAURA: you're so sweet. you don't have to. you gave me a present last year. those lovely ginzu knives.
NED: yeah... aren't they great! they last forever. and you can cut right through a shoe with 'em!

NED: it's nice to be off the streets... away from all the pain and misery out there. 
LAURA: what's he thinking when he looks at me with that goofy smile...?
NED: boy, does she look stupid in that hat.
LAURA: if i told him how i really feel, he'd probably fire me. what am i saying? he probably doesn't even know i exist.
NED: laura's incredible. and so smart. smart enough to recognize that ginzu knives are the gift of a lifetime. but she never goes out with guys. i wonder why?
LAURA: i guess i'll just have to wait. but he's married. i could wait forever. than again... maybe lana will get hit by a runaway truck. there's always a chance that...
NED: but who cares if she... oh, sorry.
LAURA: that's alright. i was just rambling.
NED: go ahead...
LAURA: no, no, really... you first...
NED: i insist... please...
LAURA: oh, uh... i just wanted to remind you about...
NED: ...the legal symposium...
LAURA: ...in santa barbara...
NED: ...tomorrow...
NED and LAURA: ..."how to sue your loved ones."
NED: yeah. i'm driving up in the morning.

LAURA: what is it, ned? you can tell me. 
NED: i'm a man, laura. and all men feel passion at one time or another. even me.
LAURA: really?
NED: what would you think of a married man who gave in to those wild, sensual, raging desires?
LAURA: oh... wow... golly...
NED: what if, for just one crazy moment, he couldn't resist...? he got knocked for a loop and lost control?
LAURA: gosh... that might be okay.
NED: what if a tidal wave of crashed over him and he was sucked into a vortex of wild, thrashing urges?
NED: well... it's not your problem. i'll work it out.

LOLA: like some ice for your drink? 
LOLA: does your wife know you're... "working" late? i certainly hope so, mr. ravine.

LANA: hurry up, darling. you'll be late! 
FRANK: it's all taken care of. when do i knock on the door?
LANA: wait until i signal you. when i raise the blinds... you knock.
LANA: not now!
FRANK: oh, later... right... okay.
LANA: drive carefully, sweetheart. say bye- bye to little ned. he loves his daddy... don't you stink pot?
NED: see you tonight, junior.

LANA: what's wrong? 
NED: this neighborhood is getting worse all the time! kids stole my engine!
LANA: why don't you catch the train to santa barbara? it leaves in twenty minutes.
NED: i'll just fly up.
LANA: no!
LANA: i mean... you can't. armed terrorists seized the airport this morning. a plane crashed into the tower... and all the runways are on fire!
NED: yeah. so?
LANA: and it's fogged in.
NED: dammit.
LANA: for my peace of mind... take the train.
NED: i can't do it. you know how i feel about riding trains.
LANA: darling... it's only a short trip.
NED: yeah... right. a short trip.
LANA: just because both your parents died in a train wreck...
NED: and my brother, jeff...
LANA: and your brother, morty...
NED: my two sisters...
LANA: right...
NED: my best friend, al... my dog, woof... grandma rose... and uncle lionel. all killed by trains!
LANA: coincidence, ned. beside... that's the past. they're gone.
NED: yeah. i guess i can't bring them back by not riding on a train.
LANA: that's right.
NED: but i just can't get over this stupid nagging fear that...
LANA: fear! what about our baby, ned? i don't want to raise a child in a home filled with fear!
LANA: but if you can conquer your fear... maybe i can conquer my fear of having a baby with a father who's fearful. ned... don't let a train kill our child before it's even conceived!
NED: i guess you're right.
LANA: you're sure now...?
NED: but we'll never make it to the station. by the time a cab gets here...
FRANK: i was in the neighborhood. thought i'd stop by and pick up my tools.
LANA: frank will drive you. won't you frank?
FRANK: sure, i'll take you to the train station.

NED: we're not going to make it. 
FRANK: we'll make it!

LANA: okay... now what're you going to do if you feel queasy going through the tunnel? 
NED: i'll stand in the vestibule between the cars.
LANA: that's right. when you get queasy... go stand in the vestibule between the cars.

WOMAN PASSENGER: oh! my dear gracious! 
IRRITABLE MAN: sir! would you please extinguish that foul smelling cigar?
MAX: you want me to put out my cigar? you want me to put out my cigar? you want me to put out my cigar?
IRRITABLE MAN: yeah.
MAX: certainly.

CONDUCTOR: ticket? 
CONDUCTOR: sorry pal... automatic weapons are only allowed in the club car after nine p.m.
CONDUCTOR: i'll check it with baggage. you can claim it at the depot in santa barbara.

JEFF: hi! i'm jeff and i'm eight years old. didja know if ya put a penny on the track it'll make the train crash? no kiddin'! you ever been in a wreck? my uncle has. lotsa times. it's really neat. everybody gets creamed! all guts... heads ripped off and stuff... hey... wanna hear my song "great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts"? 
LANA: you want to earn a couple bucks, kid?
JEFF: hi! i'm jeff and i'm eight years old. didja know if ya put a penny on the track it'll make the train crash?
LANA: he's losing it. you better get up to the next car. remember, give me the high sign as soon as you see the river. it'll be two minutes and nine seconds past the tunnel. i'll take care of the rest. anything goes wrong... just make sure you back me up. and don't let him see you.

NED: this... is not a toy! 
JEFF: yes it is.

MAX: here... let me help you with that. 
OLD WOMAN: what a nice young man. you are so polite.
MAX: i try to be.

JEFF: french fried eyeballs and ugly scabs you wanna pick... stuff to make your mother sick... dog on a stick... puke and snot all mixed together in a pot... ned is looking very pale and queasy. suddenly, jeff jumps up... presses his face against the window. 
JEFF: oh boy! here comes the tunnel!

MAX: you shootin' at me? 
MAX: yeah... you're definitely shootin' at me.

NED: in this crazy world, there's not a whole lot a guy can count on. but when the chips are down, i can always count on you. 
NED: you risked your life to save mine. a guy can't ask any more from a woman than that.
NED: but i saw you shoot him, lana. in cold blood. i gotta arrest you for murder.
LANA: ned... you wouldn't...
NED: sorry. i'm a cop. i have a job to do.
LANA: but... you said it yourself. i saved your life.
NED: don't worry, baby. i know a good lawyer.

REPORTER #1: what kind of gun did she use? 
NED: that's a question for the arresting officer.
REPORTER #2: aren't you the arresting officer?
NED: you'll have to ask her attorney.
REPORTER #1: but aren't you her attorney?
NED: only her husband can answer that.
REPORTER #3: what will mrs. ravine be wearing at the trial?
NED: a lovely powder blue dress with a cinch waist, full bodice and a delicately pleated skirt.
REPORTER #3: does it have a matching jacket?
NED: no comment.
REPORTER #3: is it cotton or rayon?
NED: i said... no comment!
REPORTER #1: did she eat any of the victim's body parts?

NED: jeez... they're really throwing some tough questions out there today. 
LAURA: they're just doing their job.
NED: yeah... well i call it a "high-tech lynching of an uppity white housewife."

NED: what's this? 
ARCH: only cell available. they had that serial killer locked up here... you know, the one who talks his victims to death then eats them... hannibal the lecturer. but they let him out for a three week tour to publicize his new book.
NED: "to serve man."
ARCH: it's a cookbook.

ARCH: and look, look... he autographed it. 
NED: to arch... love to have you for dinner sometime... hannibal. very nice.
ARCH: they're waiting for ya. they didn't want to start without her attorney being present.

LANA: pffftt! moths! this place could use a good exterminator. 
INVESTIGATOR # 2: let's get the swat team in here.
LANA: can't you get me out of this cage, ned? i'm goin' buggy in here.
NED: judge said no bail. don't worry. just tell the truth, you'll be fine.
NED: who's gonna handle the interrogation?
INVESTIGATOR 1: it's your collar... your bust... your call... your show... your play... your move... your wife...
NED: okay, okay!... i'll handle it.
INVESTIGATOR 2: sorry mrs. ravine... there's no makeup allowed in this building.
LANA: what're you gonna do... arrest me for primping?
NED: don't give us a tough time. just spill it! what were you doing on that train?
LANA: well...
NED: alright, quit playing games with us! who put ya up to it? where'd you get the gun? what's your link with the

NED: whoa whoa whoa whoa! that's it! i will not tolerate this unwarranted badgering of my client. she'll have her day in court, gentlemen. 
NED: i want to thank you, mrs. ravine, for being so cooperative with these gentlemen. did you get all that down, laura. every word she said?
LAURA: yep. both of 'em.

LOLA: yes! 
NED: noooooooooooooo!!!
LOLA: yes! cappelini pomodoro!
NED: what?
LOLA: pasta with tomato sauce. whatsa matta? you don't like italian?
NED: where's ned junior? where is he?!
LOLA: i thought he might like to get out, so i took him to the amusement park.
NED: you can't just break into my house, cook my food... borrow my skunk! leave me alone. stay out of my face! out of my neighborhood! out of my
LOLA: you haven't seen the last of me, ned.
LOLA: i told you.

CHEERLEADERS: lana, lana, she's the one shot a bad guy with a gun blew that sucker off a train some guys are a friggin' pain yaaaaaaaaaaaaay lana! 
COMMENTATOR: once again, americans are making a mockery of their courts, turning a murder trial into a media circus! how can justice ever prevail when it is ridiculed and reviled in such a heinously revolting manner? this is clement von franckenstein returning you to our bbc studios in london for the latest photographs of lady di naked in the bath.

PROSECUTOR: ...the prosecution will prove that this repulsive and degenerate woman coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding citizen... 
NED: objection! move to strike. hearsay, irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca- doody poo-poo...
JUDGE SKANKY: sustained.

NED: and can you tell us what this is? 
LAURA: yes. it's a death threat that max shady faxed to you on the day he was released from prison.
NED: a fax in which he threatened to puree certain parts of my anatomy in a blender! i'd like to submit this into evidence.
PROSECUTOR: objection! who cares about the fax in this case?
JUDGE SKANKY: i'll allow it.

NED: and is this the blender you found in the lavatory of the train? 
CONDUCTOR: yes... it is.
NED: i'd like this marked as evidence.

SPORTSCASTER: awwwww... a bad call by ravine. let's check out the re-play. 
SPORTSCASTER: look at that! the bailiff is wide open! but instead of handing it off, ravine goes for the long bomb. ohhhh! the pass is wide! a real wobbler! there's no way! he scrambles, but he just can't get his hands on it... and right there!... ...wham! that blender is gone!

LAURA: ned... did you ever consider that maybe you don't know women as well as you think you do? 
PROSECUTOR: now would you tell the court, in your own words, what you said to mr. ravine?
NED: i'm really worried about this guy. he could blow our whole case right out of the water.

JEFF: great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts... mutilated monkey meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet... great green gobs of greasy grimy gopher guts... and me without a spoon! the jurors turn pale and reach for the air sickness bags in front of them. the courtroom erupts. the judge pounds his gavel loudly. 
JUDGE SKANKY: recess! ten minutes!

PROSECUTOR: gotcha, dork face! gotcha, gotcha! 
LAURA: no you didn't!
NED: no way! uh-uh! missed by a mile!
BAILIFF: recess is over! let's go... move it, move it, move it!
SPORTSCASTER: there they go... the ucla marching band! and now... holy toledo!... it looks like the victim's mother... helen shady... is gonna take the stand! this will be the first defensive play of the afternoon.
NED: mrs. shady... would you tell us about your son, max. was he a... a good boy?
MRS. SHADY: he was the best. and that's not just a mother talking. you can ask anybody.
NED: but he got into trouble once in awhile... like all kids do?
MRS. SHADY: well, you know, pranks. little jokes and things. but he was so cute. i have pictures!
MRS. SHADY: here. this is when he set the cat on fire... oh... but the cat deserved it.
NED: and what, uh... what are these...?
MRS. SHADY: marshmallows. he just loved to toast marshmallows over a roaring cat. burned on the outside... all soft in the middle. and right here... this was taken on the day he left the priesthood to join the green berets.

NED: this is cute. 
MRS. SHADY: oh yes! that was during his ku klux klan phase. he would take the sheets right off my bed... cut those little holes in them. what a stitch he was!

NED: and is this max... with all the tools... fixing his bike? 
MRS. SHADY: why that shouldn't even be in there! it's his rotten little half-brother. stinkin' little pecker... he never was any good...

MRS. SHADY: oh! i didn't like these neo-nazi boys. they were all so fussy and persnickety about everything. heil this and heil that. oh look... here's max with his chainsaw. he loved to go to the national park and cut down those giant old trees. it made him feel so patriotic. you know, if he hadn't been such a successful criminal... i think he would have been a lumberjack. 
MRS. SHADY: but now he'll never be anything! not since... ...that woman, your wife, pulled the trigger and put my little max in his grave!
JUDGE SKANKY: mrs. shady! do not point your finger in my courtroom. it's discourteous, impolite and disrespectful.
MRS. SHADY: don't you tell me what to do with my finger! it's been more places than you've ever dreamed of!
JUDGE SKANKY: sit down!
MRS. SHADY: i'll point my finger wherever i want!

NED: did you encounter the victim... max shady... on board the train? 
IRRITABLE MAN: yeah. and i told him... "this is the no smoking car! would you please put out your cigar!"
NED: and is that the cigar in your ear?
IRRITABLE MAN: i believe it is.
NED: i'd like the cigar and the head of this witness entered into evidence.
NED: the defense calls... lana ravine!
BAILIFF: do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god?
LANA: do i have to answer that, harlan?
JUDGE SKANKY: no, no dear. i'll vouch for her.
NED: now, mrs. ravine... may i call you lana?
LANA: no. call me angel
PROSECUTOR: i object!
JUDGE SKANKY: sustained. counselor... you will address angel as mrs. ravine.
NED: mrs. ravine... would you please tell the court... what were you doing on that train?
LANA: i saw max shady at the station... saw him get on board. i knew he'd made threats to kill you and mutilate your reproductive organs...
LANA: ...so i got on the train too... so i could warn you.
NED: do you want to have children?
LANA: someday. with the right man.
NED: but you couldn't have children if my... ...were... ...and, uh...
LANA: it would be difficult.
NED: so you followed him, knowing you had to protect me... your husband... your best friend... the man you love... the future father of your children.
LANA: something like that.
NED: and when you saw that maniac standing in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and fired and fired and fired!
LANA: and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired and fired...
LANA: ...and fired and fired and fired.
NED: the defense rests, your honor.

NED: how can you convict a courageous woman who risked everything to save the life of her beloved husband? a woman who acted boldly to stop a demented maniac from doing this!... 
NED: lana ravine is a loving wife and the potential mother of my potential child. i challenge you to strike a blow for motherhood and the american justice system! put the "con" back in the constitution. put the "ju" back in jurisprudence. put the "can" back in american. and put the "dom" back in freedom. find this woman innocent!... so we can all go to bed happy tonight!

JUDGE SKANKY: so... has the jury reached a verdict? 
JURY FOREMAN: yes we have, your honor.
JUDGE SKANKY: how do you find the defendant... on the count of manslaughter?
JURY FOREMAN: not guilty.
JUDGE SKANKY: on the count of murder in the first degree?
JURY FOREMAN: not guilty.
JUDGE SKANKY: on the count of monte cristo?
JURY FOREMAN: not guilty.

JUDGE SKANKY: good. then on the count of three, let's all get the out of here! one... two... 
JUDGE SKANKY: wait... for... it...
JUDGE SKANKY: two and a half... three!
LANA: well, counselor, looks like you won another case. lucky for me.
IRRITABLE WOMAN: i told you, bernard... smoking cigars is bad for your hearing!
COURT CLERK: mrs. ravine! what can i do for ya?
LANA: how much for my gun?
LAURA: i don't believe it! she just bought her gun back! the gun she used to kill a man!
NED: yeah... the same gun that saved my life. i'm sure it has sentimental value.

FRANK: so... you did it. ya beat the rap. 
LANA: no thanks to you.
FRANK: hey... i knew he'd spring ya.
LANA: you didn't lift a finger, frank. you let me take all the heat.
FRANK: heeeee-eeey... what could i do?
LANA: you were gonna let me rot in the slammer... never say a thing.
FRANK: look... you're out... free. now we're together. that's what counts. we can try again! forget triple indemnity. we'll whack him and split three mil.
LANA: i'm not splitting anything, frank. and you know too much.
LANA: you're right. maybe i'll just screw you to death.
FRANK: now you're talkin' baby.

FORENSIC MAN: watch your step, guys. there's a lot of blood. 
INVESTIGATOR: looks like a suicide. we found a note.
INVESTIGATOR: it was stuck up his nose.
ARCH: "i can't take it anymore. i'm a mediocre mechanic... and a lousy lover."
NED: he's sure got that right.
NED: the "mechanic" part, i mean.
NED: i don't know why, arch, but i just can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't suicide.

LANA: oh... uh, ned... this is lola, um... 
NED: um? she told you her name was um? and what other lies did she tell you? i've never seen this woman in my life! never followed her home! never had with her in the refrigerator! it's all a sick fantasy... and i deny everything!
NED: when will women like you learn, you can't tear apart a perfectly good marriage with your vicious lies... miss ummmm!
LOLA: actually... it's smith. lola smith. i sell vacuum cleaners, mr. ravine. the big powerful kind that up everything in sight. i was just telling your wife, if she wants to get rid of all her dirt, she has to be willing to pay the price.
LOLA: let me know what you decide, mrs. ravine. i'm sure we can work out a convenient "payment" plan. a pleasure meeting you... ned.
LANA: i... hate... salesmen!
NED: i know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything. tell you what... let's take a trip.
LANA: a trip?
NED: yeah. just the two of us.
LANA: i like that. just you and me... all alone. i'll start packing.
NED: great. listen... i got something to take care of. i'll be back in awhile.

LOLA: who is it? 
NED: i just want to talk.
LOLA: why didn't you say so?
LOLA: would you like a drink?
NED: no thanks. i'm driving.
LOLA: then let's get to the point!
LOLA: so what's your problem, tough guy?
NED: stay away from my life, my wife, my home and my pets! i'm taking lana on a vacation and when i come back, i don't ever want to see your face again!
LOLA: a vacation! she doesn't deserve a vacation! she's a brat! a bad girl! she always was and always will be!
NED: what are you talking about? you don't know anything about lana?
LOLA: i know everything!
NED: how do you know her? who is she to you? tell me!
NED: who is she!
LOLA: she's your wife!
NED: who is she!?
LOLA: she's my sister!
NED: liar! who is she?
LOLA: she's your wife!

LOLA: she's my sister! 
LOLA: she's your wife... and my sister!
LOLA: she was spoiled rotten! she stole everything i ever had. everything! including him.
NED: him? who, him?
LOLA: dwayne. the boy's gym teacher. he was older. so mature... so strong. he smelled like dirty sweat socks and old basketballs. and he was all mine. for awhile. but lana wasn't satisfied with her own things. she had to have mine too. she took it all... my makeup, my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...
NED: you wore the same clothes?
LOLA: we were identical twins.
NED: what're you talking about? you two don't look anything alike.
LOLA: not anymore. one day i caught her stealing my lavender eye shadow and she smashed my face in with a shovel. i had fifty-three operations. when the doctors were finished with me... i looked like this! i'm ugly. ugly!
NED: you're beautiful.
LOLA: don't lie to me.
NED: they did a terrific job!
LOLA: i look in the mirror. i can see!
NED: but... you're gorgeous!
LOLA: tell that to dwayne. when he saw my face, he left me for her... because she looked more like me than i did! first she stole my looks... then she stole the only man who ever loved me!
LOLA: but i found a way to get even. the best revenge possible. destroy her marriage!
NED: that's why you did all this? seduced me... harrassed me... the tape... the flowers... the phone calls...
LOLA: you been hangin' out with tracy, haven't ya?
NED: it won't work. lana loves me.
LOLA: it doesn't matter. i'm blackmailing her for everything she's worth. she murdered that greasy auto mechanic. i saw her do it.
NED: lana killed frank kelbo?
LOLA: kelbo! his name was kelbo?
NED: yeah. why? did he burn you on car repairs too?
LOLA: dwayne's name was kelbo. he had a son. frankie kelbo.

NED: the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place and i didn't like the picture they were making. if lana really killed frank kelbo, then i had misjudged her by a mile. sure... he was a lousy mechanic. but murder? 
NED: it was all starting to give me a headache bigger than the national deficit.

LAURA: ned! i'm glad you're here. i have so much to tell you. 
NED: come on in. i'll make some tea. grab a chair.
LAURA: thanks... i brought my own.
NED: so... what have you got?
LAURA: a lottery ticket and a laundry receipt. i found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client.
LAURA: you remember that night, don't ya ned? then it hit me. lottery starts with l-o. laundry starts with l-a. l- o... l-a. lola.
LAURA: don't sweat it. it's the way a woman's mind works.
NED: how about ovaltine?
LAURA: fine. then i remembered you told me some guy named frank had been working on your wife's car for two months. you with me so far?
NED: i'm way ahead of you.
LAURA: well back it up. you probably took a wrong turn. remember your insurance policy... the one we couldn't find? i started thinking, who else had access to it beside you and me? the answer came up... lana. and since she's a woman, it's probably hidden right here.
NED: so that's where she hid the oreos.
LAURA: ned, lana wasn't trying to save your life when she shot max shady. she and frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy. but she shot the wrong guy.
NED: that's the craziest thing i ever heard.
LAURA: don't you see... frank was going to let her take the fall. so she murdered him and tried to make it look like suicide. that's when i realized there was a connection between lola and lana...
NED: yeah... they're sisters. twin sisters.
LAURA: well, hang on to your jock strap, ned. there's more.
LAURA: not only is frank's father dwayne kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher and lola cain's former lover... frank's mother is helen shady. max and frank are half-brothers who never met.
LAURA: your lovely wife, lana, murdered both of helen shady's sons.
NED: this is so unbelievable.
LAURA: and you haven't even heard my story.

LAURA: he turned into a monster. and that's when i left him. i just couldn't... 
NED: that faucet keeps turning on all by itself. i'll go check it.
LAURA: okay. i'll make the ovaltine.

NED: women are an open book. you can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches. i'd stake my career on it... stake my career on it... stake my career on it... 
NED: ...if anyone ever proves me wrong, i'll throw away my badge.

LAURA: oh ned! 
NED: you were right... there's a million things i don't know about women. maybe you can teach me a few hundred.
NED: hell... i had too many careers anyway.

LAURA: okay. but i want to have kids. 
NED: great.
NED: so... maybe i was wrong. maybe women really are like a big jigsaw puzzle... with pieces that never seem to fit where you want 'em to.

NED: ...understand women... give birth... and program a vcr. and giving birth is the easy one. 
LAURA: ned...
NED: yeah, laura?
LAURA: knock off the chatter, will ya?
LAURA: we won't need you anymore.
LAURA: we can make our own music.

ROLL END CREDITS: after the final credit, we hear: 
LAURA: ned, do you know... i want you to make love to me all night long?
NED: no. but if you hum a few bars... i'll fake it.
