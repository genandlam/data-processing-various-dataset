TOMMY: 
DARIA: key-card.
DARIA: why don't you keep my purse? i shouldn't be too long.
TOMMY: ... aloha.
DOUGLAS: hi.
TOMMY: i hope you don't take offense at this... but i just have such a weakness for a man in uniform.
DOUGLAS: if that's your thing...
TOMMY: uniform's definitely my thing. i mean, i see a sailor, i'm thinking, mmm, seafood. y'know?
DOUGLAS: i'm not actually supposed to be

10.: talking on duty. 
TOMMY: who's talking? honey, this is a flirting... but you're probably just another good-looking man wasting it all on women. world's full of fools.
TOMMY: yahtzee!... okay, mr. i-always-have- a-hard-nightstick. put away the pictures of those underfed, white males and let's broaden your horizons.
TOMMY: i like sunsets and puppy dogs, and i'm big in the pants. just hope i'm not too cute for you. and don't tell me it's a color thing, hon, or i'll come over there and slap a little discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks.
DOUGLAS: i'm hooked up.
TOMMY: another big, hot, cuddly, black love- got there first. that
DOUGLAS: sorry.
TOMMY: hey... this day and age, sweetie, i can appreciate the monogamy. saving it for your number one is keeping the world safe, and it's okay by me. even if you are just breaking my heart... guess i'll just have to come in here someday, let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest -- just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me.
DOUGLAS: i can be pretty rough.
TOMMY: don't you get me all excited now. i was just learning to accept my disappointment.

11.: tommy sticks out his hand. 
TOMMY: tommy. but you can call me rachel.

TONITA: i'm watching tv, if you need me. 
TOMMY: what the happened?
TOMMY: should we be considering a long vacation in a warm, foreign climate where there's no extradition?
FAIT: the guy who called was only interested in the black stones...
DARIA: christophe sold us out.
FAIT: or something.
DARIA: you made it.
MILES: by the skin of my ass. some chinese dude kicked me around the block. busted my ear piece.

CHRISTOPHE: please, monsieur ling --
LING: whatever you're going to say... make it the truth.

VOICE: bang. 
ARCHIE: like it?
FAIT: it's cool.
ARCHIE: want it? give you a good deal. ammo included... reactive armor, twin m240 machine guns, 120mm smoothbore cannon. guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and keep the neighbors in line.
FAIT: pass.

ARCHIE: how about a marine corps assault hovercraft? 
FAIT: i got other business.
MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS: we're outta room over here, arch.
ARCHIE: stack 'em in the office, if you have to. then archie turns his attention back to fait.
ARCHIE: ... you weren't downtown tonight by any chance, were you, tony?
FAIT: don't know what you're talking about.
ARCHIE: me either.
FAIT: ever see black diamonds before?
ARCHIE: white, blue, yellow, pink. neil diamond. lou diamond phillips. black diamonds? solid rocks? no.
ARCHIE: you got me.
FAIT: find out how much they're worth.
ARCHIE: there a timetable on this, or --
FAIT: yesterday.
ARCHIE: that's what i figured.

27.: fait's heading out. 
FAIT: i'll be back. i gotta go over a guy who me over.

SU: looks dead to me. 
FAIT: guess you got to him first.
SU: not me. someone else.
FAIT: ... you're the one who called me. the one who took on my guy... who the are you, man?
SU: my name is su.
FAIT: cool. i'm sally.
SU: i want the black stones.

FAIT: yeah? make me an offer. 
SU: you can walk out of here.
FAIT: ... no deal.
CHRISTOPHE: christophe here. leave a message.

LING: i know you're there, mr. fait. 
FAIT: who's this?

LING: the man for whom mr. christophe arranged to have the black stones brought into the country and deposited at the jewelry exchange. 
FAIT: fine. how much?
LING: maybe you didn't understand me. the stones are already mine.
FAIT: i got 'em, i'm selling 'em. so get your bid in or go yourself.

LING: i don't have time for this. 
FAIT: that your final offer?
LING: i can be a very dangerous man, mr. fait.
FAIT: everybody think i'm the goodwill or something...? look, i've had a night, and so far, i got zip for all my troubles. so i don't know who the you are, and i don't care. but hear this: you can beat my around the block all night -- brother, it ain't gonna get you those stones. a long beat. the two men facing off. then...

LING THUG #1: give us the stones. 
FAIT: man, how many times i gotta tell people: i'm a business man. make me a offer.
LING THUG #2: here's your offer.
FAIT: that ain't gonna do it, biggie. 'cause i ain't scared of guns, and i ain't got the stones.
LING THUG #1: then you're gonna tell us where they are.

SU: over here. 
FAIT: man, what the hell's up with these stones? go.

ARCHIE: it's archie. bad news. we got a problem. 
CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR: surveillance camera footage of archie's.
ARCHIE: ... i did what you said, right? put it out on the street, trying to get info on the stones. next thing i know, the jackson five here show up... now, there are three significant elements to notice here. one, i'm outnumbered. two, they're heavily armed. three, they're gonna beat me like a bongo drum...

ARCHIE: ... i mean, hey, i coulda resisted, sure -- and they coulda beat me into a coma or killed me or whatever -- but then, see, i'm thinking: how would i be able to tell tony what happened to the stones? right? what good am i dead or on life-support. so i threw in the towel. reluctantly, of course. for your sake. 
FAIT: okay. you saved yourself to tell me.
ARCHIE: what?

FAIT: who are they? 
ARCHIE: uh... don't know.
FAIT: what'd they say?
ARCHIE: well... 'give us the stones, motherfucker.' you know. that kinda thing.
FAIT: that's it?
ARCHIE: pretty much. yeah.
FAIT: thanks for keeping yourself alive to pass on all that valuable information.
SU: did you call the police?
ARCHIE: look around. are you crazy? then again, maybe you are crazy, 'cause i have no idea who you are.
FAIT: big question is, who's behind the boost?
ARCHIE: i don't know that, but i know they got great guns. i can't even get those. u.s. special forces only.
FAIT: ... chambers.
ARCHIE: what?
FAIT: he's wired into everything going down in this city, and he can get that kind of firepower. gotta be him.
SU: who's chambers?

FAIT: runs the biggest outfit in town. what warlords are to afghanistan, chambers is to l.a... and you want to take him on, you're on your own. game over for me. and now that i'm truly -- what the are you, anyway? you got some i.d.? 
INSERT - I.D.: in chinese. clearly official.
FAIT: doesn't mean to me.
ARCHIE: let me see that.
ARCHIE: taiwan. central security bureau.
FAIT: you read chinese?
ARCHIE: no. but i know 'cop' in every language.
FAIT: what, you some kinda asian james bond?
SU: the stones belong to my government.
FAIT: yeah, well, they're chambers' now. and even governments don't go to war with him.
FAIT: i'm starting to hate this phone. what now?

LING: i hope you've reconsidered. 
FAIT: hey, it's mr. dangerous. 'sup, 'homie'?
LING: you've made this difficult, mr. fait.
FAIT: can't wait to hear.
LING: i have your daughter.
LING: she's very pretty in her pink pajamas. aren't you, vanessa?
VANESSA: daddy!
FAIT: vanessa!
LING: i want my stones, mr. fait.
FAIT: motherfucker...
LING: you think about it a moment. let me talk to the chinese gentleman who's with you.
FAIT: don't you hurt her.
LING: that's up to you... the chinese

36.: gentleman, please? 
FAIT: he has my daughter.
ARCHIE: oh, jesus...
FAIT: he wants to talk to you.
SU: hello.
LING: i thought i killed you.
SU: i have the stones. no negotiations.
LING: do you really want one more person to die?
SU: no negotiations.

FAIT: what'd you just do? what happened? 
SU: i said i have the stones and won't negotiate for your daughter.
FAIT: you what?
ARCHIE: oh, jesus...
SU: it will confuse him. buy us time and keep her alive.

37.: what the fuck're you talking about? 
SU: look -- i know him. i want the stones, you want your daughter. we'll get them both back.
FAIT: ... i gotta work with you?
SU: you have no choice.
FAIT: ... we gotta go see chambers... oh, vanessa...

LING: find a place to put her. 
VANESSA: my daddy's gonna come and kick your butts.
LING: su says he has the stones... but why cut me off? why not negotiate for the girl? it doesn't make sense.

38.: the buyers fly in tomorrow. should we stop them? 
LING: we'll never regain their confidence. we need information. find the right people. pay whatever it costs. something's not right. something's happening with the stones.
SONA: what about the girl?
LING: we'll need her... she stays alive.

FAIT: i'm on the way to chambers... yeah, i know, but i got no other choice. just get the word into his pipeline that i'm coming and want permission to visit... i'll get back to you... faith... maybe chambers'll have a heart and give the stones back. yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join the peace corps. 
SU: i'm sorry about your daughter... how old is she?
FAIT: this ain't the biography channel. let's just get there.
FAIT: eight. she'll be nine in september.

39.: mine is fifteen... boyfriends... 
FAIT: never happen. i'll just kill 'em.
SU: i wish it were that easy.
FAIT: about time i got the 4-1-1.

FAIT: what's this all about? 
SU: the stones aren't what you think they are.
FAIT: no how about the guy who has vanessa?
SU: he's exactly what you think he is -- a thief and a killer.
FAIT: great...

FAIT: i used to look up to that guy. all i wanted was to be like him.

SU: in taiwan, i could force him to talk. 
FAIT: this ain't taiwan. only thing we can do now is find out where the stones are and go take 'em.

FAIT: it won't be.
FAIT: ... they're at his club.
SU: how do you know?
FAIT: i know. i can feel it. that ever happen to you?

ODION: tony fait? thought you and him were tight. bonnie and clyde.
DARIA: used to be that way. not treating me right these days. the kid's all he cares about.
ODION: ... what do you want me to do?
DARIA: ... man, i don't know. probably nothing you can do. i just

DARIA: here?... oh, man, i don't know.
ODION: you were the best. not many girls pulling in two g's a night.
DARIA: yeah, but it's been a while for that... might not remember how.
ODION: just like a bicycle, baby. you don't forget that stuff.
DARIA: don't know how jump'd feel about it.
ODION: hey, you let me worry about jump,

51.: okay? meantime, why don't you come on in, and you and me can, y'know, talk some more about it. 
DARIA: ... just talk?
ODION: ... no.
SU: they have boxing matches in the day?
ARCHIE: not exactly boxing. more dangerous. no gloves. no rules. big money. very illegal... started holding 'em during the daytime to fool the cops.
SU: the man you remembered -- how do you know he will be here?
ARCHIE: i don't. but chambers owns the operation, so i figure it's a good place to start. this is it.

SU: how will you recognize him? 
ARCHIE: i didn't see his face. but i'll know his pinkie ring when i see it. ten carats. round cut with square mount. good color and clarity. i remember thinking what it would do to my face if he hit me.

SU: how do we get in? 
ARCHIE: leave that to me.
ARCHIE: hey, man, how you doing? got a fighter here i want to enter.
ARCHIE: my man's gonna put the rest of these bums to beddy-bye. he'll go in there and get all chinese on 'em -- the teeth are gonna fly, the blood's gonna run... gonna be fun.

TOMMY: hey. howzit? 
DOORMAN: what the you doing?
TOMMY: pest control. don't tell me you didn't get your notice.
DOORMAN: what notice?
TOMMY: see, that burns my right to the bone. i mean, hey, i'm here doing my job... anyway, putting that aside, if you had gotten your notice, you'd know there's a new city ordinance saying all businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed.
DOORMAN: yeah? how come?
TOMMY: 'cause foreign people're bringing all

55.: their scary-assed foreign bugs over here. y'know, in their luggage and and then the bugs're getting loose and everything up -- eating all the trees and everything, y'know, making people sick... anyway, city says we gotta spray to prevent any infestation and possible spread. 
DOORMAN: we're doing business inside. can't let you just start hosing the place with bug spray.
TOMMY: yeah, well, maybe you should at least ask the manager about it.
DOORMAN: manager's busy.
TOMMY: ... okay. your call. just know the city quarantine people'll be here first thing tomorrow.
DOORMAN: quarantine people?
TOMMY: they'll be shutting you down for non- compliance... peace out.
DOORMAN: wait, wait, wait.
DOORMAN: city's really gonna come and close us up?
TOMMY: quicker'n a zip-loc.
DOORMAN: ... you sure you're not with me?
TOMMY: i'm a licensed exterminator. why would i be with you?

TOMMY: look. let's do this. you let me start with a couple small rooms, y'know, offices or something, someplace you don't have customers. upstairs, so the fumes don't bother anybody. i'll pop off a couple bug bombs, and then we'll do the rest later. how's that? 
DOORMAN: ... yeah, okay. get the bombs, and come on.

TOMMY: ... look. at. this. 
DOORMAN: just do your thing and go, bro.
TOMMY: roger that.
TOMMY: just keep the door closed and be sure to give this a full hour before anyone comes in.

FAIT: safe. he kneels. removes a desk panel. and... 
FAIT: take it down.

MILES: even with the music, they're gonna hear it when i fire this tank buster. 
FAIT: daria. get ready to move.

CHAMBERS: you're willing to pay ten, you're willing to pay twenty. twenty, forty. forty, eighty... i'm not selling till i know exactly where the ceiling is.
CHAMBERS: you like foreplay?
LING: how much money do you want for the stones?
CHAMBERS: i hate foreplay. the warm-up drills -- girl's gotta get in there and be ready to score points. bring it straight to the hoop. you understand? so, instead of us going back and forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for you to think of a number. a very high number. a very final number. a number so high and final it'll get me off good, bam, right when i hear it.

CHAMBERS: okay, okay... 
CHAMBERS: ain't worth my life... i'll take the five and call it a game.

ARCHIE: ... by the way, when we do find him, what then? 
SU: i'll handle it.

62.: the midget ring announcer steps in with a mike. 
RING ANNOUNCER: seven advances, eleven's out... next up, eight versus twelve. eight versus twelve. fighters report to the cage.
ARCHIE: you're after the stones, too, huh?
ARCHIE: ... i did some more checking around to see what anyone knows about 'em... guess who get back to me? my defense department connection. now, i think he's calling me about this surplus f- 14 tomcat i'm trying to get my hands on. but no. turns out he's calling to tell me about a rumor outta taiwan about black stones --
RING ANNOUNCER: number twelve!
ARCHIE: -- only they're not jewels --
RING ANNOUNCER: number twelve!
ARCHIE: they're --
FIGHT CLUB FAN: twelve's right here!
FIGHT CLUB FAN: i'd be scared of him, too.

BRUISER: let's go, chickenshit! 
SU: not today...
ARCHIE: i know it wasn't the plan. but if you don't fight, they're gonna toss us out on our asses. we might never find the guy.

COP #1: he's pretty beat up. 
ODION: yeah. fell down the stairs... enjoy the jail sex, fait.

ARCHIE: doomsday in disguise.
ARCHIE: they're some kinda new synthetic plutonium. small and portable, but mega-powerful.
TOMMY: this fucker's making bombs?

FAIT: ... okay, so we know what he's up to. how's it get us to vanessa?
SU: the buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly... somewhere private...

MILES: man, there's dozens of little airports around here. we'd never get to 'em all. 
SU: ... flight plans.
ARCHIE: hey, yeah. flight plans show destinations. all aircraft file 'em with the aviation administration. if we could get a list, we could maybe figure out where the sale's going down.
