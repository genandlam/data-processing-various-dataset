BATEMAN: you like huey lewis and the news? 
OWEN: they're okay.
BATEMAN: their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. but then sports came out in 1983, i think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the shower. he takes two valium.
BATEMAN: he's been compared to elvis costello but i think huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the barneys catalogue.
OWEN: hey, halberstam?
BATEMAN: yes, owen?

BATEMAN: no, owen. 
OWEN: is that a raincoat?
BATEMAN: yes, it is.

KIMBALL: hi. i'm donald kimball
BATEMAN: hi. pat bateman. nice to meet you.

BATEMAN: so, what's the topic of discussion?

KIMBALL: would you rather i not smoke?
BATEMAN: no, i guess it's okay.
KIMBALL: you sure?
BATEMAN: no problem.
JEAN: yes, patrick?
BATEMAN: bring us an ashtray for mr. kimball, please.
KIMBALL: what can you tell me about paul owen?
BATEMAN: well...
KIMBALL: how well did you know him?

KIMBALL: yale thing? 
BATEMAN: yeah...yale thing.
KIMBALL: what do you mean...yale thing?

KIMBALL: so...there's nothing you can tell me about paul owen? 
BATEMAN: he led what i suppose was an orderly life. he... ate a balanced diet.
KIMBALL: what kind of man was he? besides... the information you've just given.
BATEMAN: i hope i'm not being cross-examined here.
KIMBALL: do you feel that way?

BATEMAN: we were both seven in 1969.
KIMBALL: so was i.
BATEMAN: do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

BATEMAN: well, maybe he did, huh? 
KIMBALL: his girlfriend doesn't think so.
BATEMAN: but...has anyone seen him in london?
KIMBALL: actually, yes.
BATEMAN: hmmm.

KIMBALL: yeah, i know, and was into that whole yale thing. a pause - the longest so far. 
BATEMAN: have you consulted a psychic?
KIMBALL: no.
BATEMAN: had his apartment been burglarized?

KIMBALL: no, not yet. as i said, we're not sure. but... basically no one has seen or heard anything. 
BATEMAN: that's so typical, isn't it?
KIMBALL: it's just strange.
BATEMAN: nothing.
KIMBALL: people just...disappear.
BATEMAN: the earth just opens up and swallows people.
KIMBALL: eerie. really eerie.
KIMBALL: isn't the four seasons a little far uptown? i mean aren't you going to be late?
BATEMAN: uh, no. there's one...down here.
KIMBALL: oh really? i didn't know that.
BATEMAN: yes. it's very good.

BATEMAN: absolutely, i'm 100% with you. 
KIMBALL: great, and thanks for your, uh, time, mr. bateman. bateman closes the door firmly on kimball. he closes his eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

BATEMAN: you like that, slut? the person on the other end clearly hangs up. close-up on his fingers dialing the phone. 
BATEMAN: you want to know what i'm wearing? sixty-dollar
GIRL: dad, is that you?

BATEMAN: i haven't seen you around here. 
CHRISTIE: you just haven't been looking.
BATEMAN: would you like to see my apartment?

CHRISTIE: i'm not supposed to. but i can make an exception.
BATEMAN: do you take american express?
BATEMAN: do you take american express?

BATEMAN: thank you. send her up. christie, get out and dry off, choose a robe-not the bijan and come and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks. bateman answers the door.

BATEMAN: not quite blonde, are you? more dirty blonde. i'm going to call you sabrina. i'm paul owen. bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a glass of wine. christie enters, sitting next to sabrina on the couch, and bateman sits across from them. there is a long silence. 
BATEMAN: so, don't you want to know what i do?
CHRISTIE: no.
SABRINA: no, not really.
BATEMAN: well, i work on wall street. at pierce and pierce. have you heard of it?
CHRISTIE: you have a really nice place here...paul. how much did you pay for it?
BATEMAN: actually, that's none of your business, christie, hut i can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap. bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and sabrina takes a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.
BATEMAN: no, no smoking. not in here.
BATEMAN: varda truffle?
BATEMAN: i don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking.
BATEMAN: do you like phil collins? i've been a big genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, duke. before that i really didn't understand any of their work. it was too artsy, too intellectual. it was on duke where phil collins' presence became more apparent. he puts aside the cd and takes out another one.

BATEMAN: in terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer

BATEMAN: just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. the driver's here, you'll be safe. christie gets in hesitantly.
BATEMAN: nothing like last time, promise.
CHRISTIE: alright.
BATEMAN: so, you're looking great, how have you been?
BATEMAN: really?
CHRISTIE: my friend told me i should maybe even get a lawyer.

BATEMAN:  
BATEMAN: uh uh uh. half now, half later.

BATEMAN: did you know that whitney houston's debut lp 
ELIZABETH: you actually listen to whitney houston? you

EVELYN: i want a firm commitment. 
BATEMAN: i think, evelyn, that we've...lost touch. evelyn waves to a couple across the room.
EVELYN: why? what's wrong?
BATEMAN: we need to talk.
EVELYN: talk about what, patrick? what is there to talk about?
BATEMAN: it's over, evelyn. it's all over
BATEMAN: i'm serious. it's over. us. this

EVELYN: you're really serious, aren't you? 
BATEMAN: yes, i am.
EVELYN: but what about the past? our past?
BATEMAN: we never really shared one.
EVELYN: you're inhuman.
BATEMAN: i'm...in touch with humanity. evelyn, i'm sorry. you're just not terribly important to me. evelyn begins to cry.
EVELYN: no, no, no.
BATEMAN: i know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
EVELYN: oh i can't believe this.

EVELYN: where are you going?

EVELYN: but where?
BATEMAN: i have to return some videotapes.

BATEMAN: here kitty, kitty. 
WOMAN: oh my stop that! what are you doing?

KIMBALL: no hash browns? 
BATEMAN: not in the mood, i guess.
KIMBALL: but...everyone orders the hash browns here. i mean- it's-have you been here before?
KIMBALL: suit yourself, i guess.
KIMBALL: so, the night he disappeared? any new thoughts on what you did?
BATEMAN: i'm not really sure. i had a shower...and some sorbet?
KIMBALL: i think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
BATEMAN: but how? where do you place paul that night?

BATEMAN: and? 
KIMBALL: i've questioned him.
BATEMAN: marcus?

BATEMAN: but marcus denied it? 
KIMBALL: yes.
BATEMAN: well, does marcus have an alibi?
KIMBALL: yes.
BATEMAN: he does? you're sure?
KIMBALL: i checked it out. it's clean.
BATEMAN: oh. kimball now where were you?
BATEMAN: where was marcus?
KIMBALL: he wasn't with paul owen.
BATEMAN: so who was he with?

DOORMAN: of course. mrs. wolfe is up there right now. 
BATEMAN: mrs. wolfe?
DOORMAN: the real estate agent? you do have an appointment, don't you? bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway. owen's door is open. the apartment is freshly painted and has been immaculately redecorated in english country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. there are flowers everywhere, and a young yuppie couple stands admiring the place talkingto the realtor, mrs. wolfe. bateman wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. he stops at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. he opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. mrs. wolfe approaches, smiling.
MRS. WOLFE: are you my two o'clock?
BATEMAN: no.
MRS. WOLFE: can i help you?
BATEMAN: i'm looking for...paul owen's...place.
BATEMAN: doesn't he live here?
MRS. WOLFE: no, he doesn't.
BATEMAN: are you sure?
MRS. WOLFE: you saw the ad in the times?
BATEMAN: no. yes. i mean yes, i did. in the times. but... doesn't paul owen still live here?
MRS. WOLFE: there was no ad in the times.
MRS. WOLFE: i think you should go now.
BATEMAN: but i think...i want to know what happened here.
MRS. WOLFE: don't make any trouble. please. i suggest you go. bateman backs away slowly.
MRS. WOLFE: don't come back.
BATEMAN: i won't...don't worry.

BATEMAN: excuse me, gentlemen. right back.

BATEMAN: shut up, carnes, they will not. 
BATEMAN: so, harold, did you get my message?

CARNES: it was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
