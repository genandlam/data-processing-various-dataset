speaker1: oh christ, this really isn't worth it. and see, courtney, it's there for what? huh? tell us. why is it pulled down half an inch? so it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
speaker2: well, it's not a turn-on for me.

speaker1: eggshell with romalian type. what do you think?
speaker3: nice.

speaker1: but wait. you ain't seen nothin' yet. 
speaker1: raised lettering, pale nimbus white...

speaker1: so, wasn't rothschild originally handling the fisher account? how did you get it?

speaker1: no, man. i'm gonna bail. 
speaker2: come on, you son of a

speaker1: you like huey lewis and the news? 
speaker2: they're okay.
speaker1: their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. but then sports came out in 1983, i think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the shower. he takes two valium.
speaker1: he's been compared to elvis costello but i think huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the barneys catalogue.
speaker2: hey, halberstam?
speaker1: yes, owen?

speaker1: no, owen. 
speaker2: is that a raincoat?
speaker1: yes, it is.
speaker1: in 1987 huey released this, fore!, their most
speaker1: hey, paul?
speaker1: bastard...

speaker1: patrick? is that you? 
speaker2: no, luis. it's not me. you're mistaken.
speaker1: this is gwendolyn ichiban. this is my very good
speaker2: commes des garcon.
speaker1: call me please, patrick.
speaker2: lives, luis.

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: patrick?
speaker1: ye-es, je-an?
speaker2: patrick, a mr. donald kimball is here to see you.
speaker1: who?
speaker2: detective donald kimball?
speaker1: tell him i'm at lunch.
speaker2: patrick, i think he knows you're here. it's only ten-thirty.

speaker1: no, i'm sorry. i should've made an appointment. was that anything important? 
speaker2: oh that? just mulling over business problems. examining opportunities...exchanging rumors... spreading gossip. they laugh politely.
speaker1: hi. i'm donald kimball
speaker2: hi. pat bateman. nice to meet you.

speaker1: so, what's the topic of discussion? 
speaker2: i've been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen.
speaker1: you're not with the fbi or anything, are you?

speaker1: ah, i see...yes. paul's disappearance...yes. 
speaker2: so it's nothing that official. i just have some basic questions. about paul owen. about yourself-
speaker1: coffee?
speaker2: no. i'm okay.
speaker1: perrier? san pellegrino?
speaker2: no, i'm okay.
speaker3: patrick?
speaker1: can you bring mr...

speaker1: mr. kimball a bottle of san pelle- 
speaker2: oh no, i'm okay.
speaker1: it's no problem
speaker1: well, what's the topic of discussion?
speaker2: the disappearance of paul owen.

speaker1: i think his family wants this kept quiet. 
speaker2: understandable.
speaker1: no, really. i'm okay.
speaker2: you sure? i can always get you a lime.

speaker1: shoot. 
speaker2: how old are you?
speaker1: twenty-six. i'll be twenty-seven in october.
speaker2: where did you go to school?
speaker1: harvard. the harvard business school.
speaker2: your address?
speaker1: fifty-five west eighty-first street. the american gardens building.
speaker2: nice. very nice.
speaker1: thanks.
speaker2: pardon me, but are you okay?
speaker1: who do you ask?
speaker2: you seem...nervous.
speaker1: nuprin? kimball uh...no, thanks.
speaker1: bad habit.
speaker2: i know. i'm sorry. a pause, as bateman stares at the cigarettes.
speaker2: would you rather i not smoke?
speaker1: no, i guess it's okay.
speaker2: you sure?
speaker1: no problem.
speaker3: yes, patrick?
speaker1: bring us an ashtray for mr. kimball, please.
speaker2: what can you tell me about paul owen?
speaker1: well...
speaker2: how well did you know him?

speaker1: yale thing? 
speaker2: yeah...yale thing.
speaker1: what do you mean...yale thing?

speaker1: so...there's nothing you can tell me about paul owen? 
speaker2: he led what i suppose was an orderly life. he... ate a balanced diet.
speaker1: what kind of man was he? besides... the information you've just given.
speaker2: i hope i'm not being cross-examined here.
speaker1: do you feel that way?
speaker2: no. not really.
speaker1: where did paul hang out?
speaker2: hang...out?
speaker1: yeah. you know...hang out.

speaker1: he had a yacht? 
speaker2: no, he just hung out there.
speaker1: and where did he go to school?
speaker2: don't you know this?
speaker1: i just wanted to know if you know.

speaker1: i understand. 
speaker1: anything else you can tell me about owen?
speaker2: we were both seven in 1969.
speaker1: so was i.
speaker2: do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

speaker1: well, maybe he did, huh? 
speaker2: his girlfriend doesn't think so.
speaker1: but...has anyone seen him in london?
speaker2: actually, yes.
speaker1: hmmm.

speaker1: yeah, i know, and was into that whole yale thing. a pause - the longest so far. 
speaker2: have you consulted a psychic?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: had his apartment been burglarized?

speaker1: no, not yet. as i said, we're not sure. but... basically no one has seen or heard anything. 
speaker2: that's so typical, isn't it?
speaker1: it's just strange.
speaker2: nothing.
speaker1: people just...disappear.
speaker2: the earth just opens up and swallows people.
speaker1: eerie. really eerie.
speaker1: isn't the four seasons a little far uptown? i mean aren't you going to be late?
speaker2: uh, no. there's one...down here.
speaker1: oh really? i didn't know that.
speaker2: yes. it's very good.

speaker1: absolutely, i'm 100% with you. 
speaker2: great, and thanks for your, uh, time, mr. bateman. bateman closes the door firmly on kimball. he closes his eyes and leans against the door, sweating.

speaker1: you like that, slut? the person on the other end clearly hangs up. close-up on his fingers dialing the phone. 
speaker1: you want to know what i'm wearing? sixty-dollar
speaker2: dad, is that you?

speaker1: i haven't seen you around here. 
speaker2: you just haven't been looking.
speaker1: would you like to see my apartment?
speaker2: i'm not supposed to.
speaker1: do you want to come to my apartment or not?
speaker2: i'm not supposed to. but i can make an exception.
speaker1: do you take american express?
speaker1: do you take american express?
speaker1: i'm joking. come on, get in.

speaker1: that's a very fine chardonnay you're drinking. 
speaker1: i want you to clean your vagina.
speaker1: no. from behind. get on your knees.
speaker1: i want to watch. you have a very nice body. the doorman rings. bateman answers.
speaker1: thank you. send her up. christie, get out and dry off, choose a robe-not the bijan and come and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks. bateman answers the door.

speaker1: not quite blonde, are you? more dirty blonde. i'm going to call you sabrina. i'm paul owen. bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a glass of wine. christie enters, sitting next to sabrina on the couch, and bateman sits across from them. there is a long silence. 
speaker1: so, don't you want to know what i do?
speaker2: no.
speaker3: no, not really.
speaker1: well, i work on wall street. at pierce and pierce. have you heard of it?
speaker2: you have a really nice place here...paul. how much did you pay for it?
speaker1: actually, that's none of your business, christie, hut i can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap. bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and sabrina takes a pack of cigarettes out of her purse. bateman returns, carrying a tray of chocolates.
speaker1: no, no smoking. not in here.
speaker1: varda truffle?
speaker1: i don't want you to get drunk, but that's a very fine chardonnay you're not drinking.
speaker1: do you like phil collins? i've been a big genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, duke. before that i really didn't understand any of their work. it was too artsy, too intellectual. it was on duke where phil collins' presence became more apparent. he puts aside the cd and takes out another one.

speaker1: in terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer 
speaker1: take the lyrics to "land of confusion." in this

speaker1: don't touch the rolex. 
speaker1: we're not through yet...

speaker1: what an mcdermott why is laurie kennedy dating price? he's a drug addict. no self-control. 
speaker2: but laurie kennedy is a total hardbody. what do you think, bateman?
speaker1: i know her. i knew her. mcdermott
speaker2: because he dated her.
speaker1: how did you guess?
speaker2: girls dig bateman. he's cq. you're total cq, bateman.
speaker1: thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality. mcdermott so what? it's all looks. laurie kennedy is a
speaker2: if they have a good personality, then something is very wrong. mcdermott if they have a good personality and they are not great looking-who cares?

speaker1: a good personality consists of a chick with a 
speaker1: absolutely. mcdermott
speaker2: do you know what ed gein said about women?
speaker1: ed gein? maitre d' at canal bar?

speaker1: i mean-mon. we be jammin'...
speaker2: i have to talk to these girls? they're models. mcdermott someone has to get the bolivian marching powder. you went last time. stay here. mcdermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears.
speaker3: where did craig go?

speaker2: no, not really.
speaker3: gorbachev's not downstairs.
speaker4: are you iying?

speaker1: ask me a question.

speaker1: no, you son of a i'm serious. i'm disappearing.
speaker2: where to? morgan stanley? rehab? what? price looks away. mcdermott and daisy walk up to them. mcdermott hey-don't worry, be happy. price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is shouting something that can't be heard, then
speaker1: goodbye! fuckheads! he climbs over the railing.
speaker2: price! come back!

speaker1: oh really? 
speaker2: he said... he said you gave him bad vibes.
speaker1: that's...that's too bad.

speaker2: no. no, i guess not. i don't want to get bruised. you're right, i should go. she gets up to leave.

speaker1: kimball-i've been wanting to talk with you, come into my office. jean, great jacket. matsuda? jean looks flustered. kimball follows bateman into his office. 
speaker2: i actually came to see timothy price, but he's taken a leave of absence.

speaker1: does he do this all the time?
speaker2: christie, you're not drinking your wine.

speaker1: did you know that whitney houston's debut lp 
speaker2: you actually listen to whitney houston? you

speaker1: i want a firm commitment. 
speaker2: i think, evelyn, that we've...lost touch. evelyn waves to a couple across the room.
speaker1: why? what's wrong?
speaker2: we need to talk.
speaker1: talk about what, patrick? what is there to talk about?
speaker2: it's over, evelyn. it's all over
speaker2: i'm serious. it's over. us. this

speaker2: we never really shared one.

speaker2: i'm...in touch with humanity. evelyn, i'm sorry. you're just not terribly important to me. evelyn begins to cry.
speaker1: no, no, no.
speaker2: i know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.

speaker2: i'm just leaving.
speaker1: but where?
speaker2: i have to return some videotapes.

speaker1: here kitty, kitty.

speaker1: no hash browns? 
speaker2: not in the mood, i guess.
speaker1: but...everyone orders the hash browns here. i mean- it's-have you been here before?
speaker1: suit yourself, i guess.
speaker1: so, the night he disappeared? any new thoughts on what you did?
speaker2: i'm not really sure. i had a shower...and some sorbet?
speaker1: i think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
speaker2: but how? where do you place paul that night?

speaker1: and? 
speaker2: i've questioned him.
speaker1: marcus?

speaker1: but marcus denied it? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: well, does marcus have an alibi?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: he does? you're sure?
speaker2: i checked it out. it's clean.
speaker1: oh. kimball now where were you?
speaker1: where was marcus?
speaker2: he wasn't with paul owen.
speaker1: so who was he with?

speaker1: of course. mrs. wolfe is up there right now. 
speaker2: mrs. wolfe?
speaker1: the real estate agent? you do have an appointment, don't you? bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway. owen's door is open. the apartment is freshly painted and has been immaculately redecorated in english country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. there are flowers everywhere, and a young yuppie couple stands admiring the place talkingto the realtor, mrs. wolfe. bateman wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. he stops at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. he opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. mrs. wolfe approaches, smiling.
speaker3: are you my two o'clock?
speaker2: no.
speaker3: can i help you?
speaker2: i'm looking for...paul owen's...place.
speaker2: doesn't he live here?
speaker3: no, he doesn't.

speaker2: no. yes. i mean yes, i did. in the times. but... doesn't paul owen still live here?
speaker3: there was no ad in the times.
speaker3: i think you should go now.
speaker2: but i think...i want to know what happened here.
speaker3: don't make any trouble. please. i suggest you go. bateman backs away slowly.
speaker3: don't come back.
speaker2: i won't...don't worry.

speaker2: keep your shirt on. maybe lose the suspenders. bateman spots harold carnes at the bar, tenses.
speaker1: excuse me, gentlemen. right back.

speaker1: shut up, carnes, they will not. 
speaker1: so, harold, did you get my message?

speaker3: i'm just a happy camper. rockin' and a-rollin'.
speaker1: rehab's done wonders for you, pal. working for unicef now? mcdermott

speaker2: but inside...
speaker3: but inside doesn't matter...
