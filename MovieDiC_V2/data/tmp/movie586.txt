LYONS: quite a beast, there. but what you gonna do with him - on a working farm? i hope you got the rent, ted. i'll be around for it when it comes due.
SI EASTON: you're a fool, ted. and our rosie'll never forgive you.

MRS. NARRACOTT: what have you done? 
ALBERT: that's mooney's colt!
MRS. NARRACOTT: you were supposed to buy a plow horse.
ALBERT: you bought him?
MRS. NARRACOTT: what'd you pay for him?
MRS. NARRACOTT: how much, ted narracott?
DAD: i won't tell you a lie - though i would love to. thirty guineas.
MRS. NARRACOTT: thirty guineas!
MRS. NARRACOTT: he's not worth ten! are you out of your mind? what about the rent?
DAD: he's a strong one, rosie. look at the way he holds his head!
MRS. NARRACOTT: how the are we gonna pull anything with that? ted - you have to take him back. you have to take him back right now now.
ALBERT: no.

MRS. NARRACOTT: you have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back. 
ALBERT: no. no, please don't take him back.
DAD: we can't take him back till he's broken in.
MRS. NARRACOTT: and how are you gonna train a horse with that leg?
ALBERT: i'll train him.
MRS. NARRACOTT: no, you stay out of this, albie. you don't know nothing about horses.
ALBERT: please, mum. please let me. i can do it.
DAD: we have to keep him. we've no choice.
MRS. NARRACOTT: right. well... you've got one month to break him in or i'm taking him back myself. how did you get to thirty - what other fool bid you up that high?
DAD: it was lyons.
MRS. NARRACOTT: we're gonna lose everything. after all we've been through - we're gonna lose it all.

ALBERT: right. let's make a start then. 
ALBERT: it's oats. very tasty, that is. it's beef and gravy to us!
ALBERT: come on...
ALBERT: i bet you're missing your mother. look at you... first time without your mum. first time away from home. but you're not alone, are you. in fact. cos i'm `ere...
ALBERT: it's alright. it's alright.

ALBERT: whoa. i want you to stay there, joey. stay. that's it. good boy. that's it, you've got it. 
ANDREW: hey, look at him, albie. he's playing "grandma's footsteps."
ALBERT: right, come on, joey. back you go.

ALBERT: you're all right. that's it. good boy. right. you've gotta stay there, understand? 
ALBERT: that's it. good boy. you've got it. good boy.
ANDREW: good boy. good.
ANDREW: now call him. whistle.
ALBERT: come now, joey. come on.
ALBERT: you can come now, joey.
ANDREW: don't think he fancies your owls.
ALBERT: no, i read it in a story. it's how the indians used to summon their horses.
ALBERT: now, joey, when i whistle, you've gotta come, understand?
ANDREW: my dad had a dog who stayed when you called him. he used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and uh...
ALBERT: he's not a dog. he's just puzzling it through.

ANDREW: brilliant. look at you. 
MRS. NARRACOTT: albie.

LYONS: there's only fifteen here. 
DAD: the rest will come.
LYONS: you know by rights i could take this farm back today, don't you? and i'm a great believer in my rights.
DAD: it will come.
LYONS: if you drank less beer and bought fewer horses you might be able to look your landlord in the eye, narracott.

DAD: i said i'll pay you. we got to plant the bottom field. 
LYONS: bottom field's rock hard. only stones down there.
DAD: no, we're going to plow it. just give me `til the autumn. i'll pay every penny i owe you. with interest.
LYONS: how you going to plow it? not with that fancy animal of yours?
DAD: he'll do it.
LYONS: you'll not get that one in a harness, let alone pulling a plow. even drunk on a tuesday night, you know that. and i can't wait for the money - there's a war coming. dad stands up from his chair, resolute.
DAD: i promise you that field will be plowed. we'll plant it with turnips. and the money will be yours when harvest comes. mrs. narracott interjects, desperate.
MRS. NARRACOTT: please, sir. please.
LYONS: very well - if that fancy plows that field i'll give you till october to set things straight.
ALBERT: what if he doesn't?
LYONS: i'll take the horse on the day he fails.

LYONS: and i'll take your father's farm and give it to working men who can hold their pints and hold their heads high in decent company. 
ALBERT: no, please. sir, you can't do that.
LYONS: now, now, now, lad. what - are you bladdered as well?! ted narracott - i got you down in my book!

ALBERT: you can't harness him. 
DAD: he's got to be collared.
ALBERT: no, you can't. look, you're scaring him, dad. you're scaring him. he...
ALBERT: he can't take a plow!
DAD: he's got to plow!

ALBERT: he won't be able to do it - he's too young - he's not even been backed yet.... 
MRS. NARRACOTT: ted!
ALBERT: it's alright, boy. it's alright. it's alright. it's alright.
MRS. NARRACOTT: i knew this would happen soon as i laid eyes on him....
MRS. NARRACOTT: ted. no. ted, no!
DAD: he's worth nothing to me! if he won't take the collar, he's not worth a thing!
ALBERT: dad? he grabs the rifle, but dad shoves him away.
DAD: move aside.
ALBERT: dad. stop.
MRS. NARRACOTT: you shoot that horse we have nothing.

ALBERT: you were right what you said, dad. "he'll do it," you told lyons, "he'll plow that field." and he will! you'll see. he'll show you. we'll show you. we'll get it done. 
MUM: let go. let go.
MUM: go back to the house.
MRS. NARRACOTT: here, here. some days are best forgotten. today ain't one of them. come on.

ALBERT: now, i'm gonna teach you how to plow and you're gonna learn. is that understood? and then we can be together, which is how i believe things are meant to be. 
ALBERT: boy. steady, boy. here we go. here we go.
ALBERT: easy, easy... look at me, joey. see? see? you've just gotta put your nose through.
ALBERT: that's it. see? you've got it. you've got it. good boy. there... harold honks his approval.

ANDREW: yet he will, i say. 
SI EASTON: you'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if albert had told you so. it's a fine thing, loyal to your mate. even if he is a bit barmy. a team of two might manage, given a month and good weather.
LYONS: ted too squeamish to watch, is he?
SI EASTON: `course he's watching.
LYONS: well, you've raised him up a true narracott, ted, picture of his father, he is: not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness that'll lead him to insist on the impossible.
LYONS: wasn't a farmer in devon didn't admire you, myself among `em, leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stoney patch of unpromising ground. you've fettle enough for twenty men, but with a gimpy leg and the drinking - for the pain, isn't it, that you drink?

LYONS: and now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you. 
ALBERT: see joey - i got the collar, too!
ALBERT: come on, boy. walk on. that's it. walk on! walk on, joey. come on, boy, walk on.
LYONS: you'd be better off startin' at the top of the hill and goin' down! gravity's the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad.
ALBERT: walk on, joey! walk on! come on, joey, walk on. walk on, boy.
ALBERT: walk on. come on, walk on.

LYONS: bravo! you've reached the top of the hill! off you go again, boy! you'll make even better time comin' down!! he continues past dad, laughing. 
ALBERT: good boy. good lad. good lad. now walk on. good boy.
ANDREW: albie, we're all with ya!
LYONS: look look look! the plow hasn't even cut yet!

ALBERT: do you know - i believe we can do it, joey. i knew when i first saw you that you'd be the best of us. that's why he bought you. he knows you've all the courage he never had. i knew when i first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us. 
ALBERT: whoa. whoa.
LYONS: you've got no chance, lad. he'll not turn over half an acre. give it up now. you've done well. you've tried hard. you're more of a man than your father.
SI EASTON: come on now, mr. lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it?
LYONS: well, he'll destroy that horse.
LYONS: i'll be over thursday. give you a day to close it up.

NEIGHBOUR: your wool. 
NEIGHBOUR: i'm sorry, rosie.
ALBERT: now, boy! you've got to do it, joey. you don't know, so i'm gonna have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this! so get set to pull - and pull straight! and pull hard!
ALBERT: now, boy! go!
ALBERT: walk on, joey! walk on! that's it! good boy, joey! good boy!
ANDREW: walk on! walk on! walk on! walk on, joey!
ANDREW: go around it!!
ALBERT: whoa, joey! whoa, joey! joey! joey, whoa whoa whoa! joey, stop! you'll break the blade -

LYONS: i'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade. he could lose a foot! 
ROSIE NARRACOTT: you'll likelier lose an eye, mr. lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son! or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm!
MRS. NARRACOTT: come on, albie! push on through!
ANDREW: get it done, albie! get it done!

ROSIE: you're as battered and bloodied as he is. 
ALBERT: and where's dad?
ROSIE: still in the bottom field.
ALBERT: stumbling about, i suppose.
ROSIE: it's not the drink, albert, that makes him stumble -

ALBERT: he drinks, mum. 
ROSIE: well, so might you if you'd been where he's been, seen what he's seen!
ALBERT: well, he don't talk to me about it.
ROSIE: he don't talk about it because he can't. there aren't words for some things. come here...
ROSIE: the mice've been at it. sit down.
MRS. NARRACOTT: here. it's his campaign pennant. he were sergeant, seventh battalion, imperial yeomanry.
ROSIE: and that is the queen's south africa medal. every man who fought in the boer war got one of those. but this...
ROSIE: that's the distinguished conduct medal.

ALBERT: not dad's? 
ROSIE: well it ain't mine, dear. he got that after the fighting at transvaal. after he'd been hurt, and he'd saved some other lads, and well... i don't know what else, he won't tell me either. but the first day he got home he just... tossed them out. first day he could walk, he threw `em straight in the dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word i said not to.
ROSIE: see, what you done today, you and joey, you're chuffed up now, and so you should be, my splendid boy. it's good to be proud when you done something good. but what he done, in africa, whatever it was, he takes no pride in it. hard as it surely was, and however much pain it's cost him, he refuses to be proud of killing, i suppose.
ALBERT: i'd be proud. if i'd gone off to war. if i'd gone and saved my mates, and -
ROSIE: well, whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him... think how brave he is for refusing to be proud.

ROSIE: oh, your dad makes mistakes. and he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made - but he never gave up and he does that for us. and today, you showed the world it's all been worth it. 
ROSIE: you keep looking after joey and he'll always be looking after you.
ALBERT: sergeant, seventh battalion, imperial yeomanry. you see this, joey? it's been through an entire war.
ALBERT: i'm not stealing it. i'll give it back to him, someday.

DAVID: um, i'm the only boy that drives in the village. no one else drives but me. 
YOUNG WOMAN: oh, yeah?
DAVID: that's right and this is my dad's car. you're lucky that you're in it. i'm not normally allowed to drive it `cause it's so -
YOUNG WOMAN: is he a friend of yours?
ALBERT: come on, boy, let's show her how to fly!

ALBERT: we can try planting something else, or we could hire ourselves out to uncle bob. 
ALBERT: how else we gonna pay mr. lyons' rent?

MRS. NARRACOTT: what we gonna do? 
DAD: i used to believe that gave each man his fair portion of bad luck. i don't feel that any more. i've had more than my share.

MOTORBIKE RIDER: it's war! 
MOTORBIKE RIDER: we are at war with germany. you hear? england is at war with germany.
MOTORBIKE RIDER: they're going to ring the bells at six o'clock - and then never ring them again until the war is over.

ALBERT: look smart, joey lad, it's the tavistock fair! 
EXT./ INT. KITCHEN / YARD. DAY.: albert runs out.
ALBERT: what has he done with him?

DAD: take my word for it - finest horse in the parish. goes like a racer, strong, decent, very fine. 
SAM PERKINS: no curbs, no splints, good feet and teeth. he's as sound as a bell, sir.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: and how much are you charging, sir - for this strong, decent, and very fine animal?!
DAD: forty.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i'll give you twenty and not a penny more.
DAD: twenty is no good to me, captain. thirty five and he's yours.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i don't even know how he rides.
DAD: oh, he rides... splendidly. you'll be astonished. i promise you that.
DAD: finest horse in all of devon. finest horse i ever seen.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: thank you. 
ALBERT: you can't! you can't, he's mine! i trained him!

DAD: albert. 
ALBERT: you can't have him. he's my horse, sir.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i'm afraid it's too late, lad. i've just paid thirty guineas for him.
ALBERT: please, i'll get you money. i will, i'll get you money. i'll...i'll work for it! i'll work for it.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i'm sorry.
ALBERT: well, if joey's going, i'm going, too. i'm volunteering.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i see. what's your name, lad?
ALBERT: albert, sir.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: and how old are you, albert?
ALBERT: nineteen, sir.
CAPTAIN NICHOLS: is that the truth?
ALBERT: no sir. but, but i look nineteen and i'm bigger than most nineteen-year- olds, sir! and i'm strong, sir! and i...i'm not afraid of anything.

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i don't doubt your qualifications, albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering, and your father's done what he had to do. you know that. thirty guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your joey, i know that. but it's all i've got. will you lease him to me, albert, to be my own mount? 
EARNEST): i promise you, man to man, that i'll look after him as closely as you've done, i'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him. and if i can - i'll return him to your care.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: now say goodbye.
ALBERT: it's all right, boy...
SAM PERKINS: all right, turn it in, eh? that's enough. he's a horse, not a dog. now, on your way.
SAM PERKINS: come on.
DAD: do you want to lose the farm, rose?
ROSIE: it's the way you did it.
DAD: but we're at war.

ALBERT: joey... 
SAM PERKINS: here now, i've told you - sling your hook!
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: let him be, perkins.
ALBERT: this isn't the end. this isn't the end, my brother... i, albert narracott, solemnly swear we will be together again. wherever you are, i will find you. and i will bring you home!

GROOM: whoa whoa whoa. easy easy... 
SAM PERKINS: whoa whoa whoa, joey! stop muckin' about, you hear? yer in the army now, son.
SAM PERKINS: good boy, good boy. steady steady... easy. relax. easy easy, back up.
SAM PERKINS: joey - meet topthorn. topthorn - this is joey. sort out who's in charge between the two of you, you hear? if you want to fight, you get it over with - `cause once we're over there, you're gonna need everything you've got for fritz!
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: gently, perkins. i don't want to sour him.

SAM PERKINS: there'll be nothing gentle about the war, sir. and there'll be nothing gentle about this one either! 
SAM PERKINS: i understand that, sergeant, but i want him fit and shining. he's my horse.
SAM PERKINS: sir.
CHARLIE WAVERLY: scares the living daylights out of me.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: who?
CHARLIE WAVERLY: perkins. glad he's on our side.
MAJOR STEWART: not bad. not bad at all. still not a patch on my topthorn.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i wouldn't be so sure. i think he's got potential. he's certainly got the bit between his teeth.
CHARLIE WAVERLY: i actually think my blenheim is faster than the pair of them.
MAJOR STEWART: clear off!

MAJOR STEWART: all right, gentlemen, listen here. everything tells us the same story, from waterloo to omdurman, from pickett's charge to the battle of mars la tours - the first attack can and should be the decisive one. 
SAM PERKINS: yes, sir!
MAJOR STEWART: no excuses, no mistakes - every horse groomed and fit for presentation! i want a full practice charge tomorrow.
SAM PERKINS: sir.

MAJOR STEWART: thought you two had bottled out. 
CHARLIE WAVERLY: as if.
MAJOR STEWART: all right, then, let's see what you two jokers are made of, shall we?

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: this is what quiet confidence looks like. 
CHARLIE WAVERLY: i'll wait for you two at the duke of york.
MAJOR STEWART: over to you, captain nicholls.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: draw...swords!
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: give...point!
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: charge!!!!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: come on, joey. i know you've got it. come on, boy! come on! 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: come on, boy!
MAJOR STEWART: whoa. whoa.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: nice of you to turn up.
MAJOR STEWART: he's got speed...i'll give him that. but has he got stamina?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: he has everything.

MAJOR STEWART: what are you up to? 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i'm writing a letter.
MAJOR STEWART: with a picture in it?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: it's to the boy who owned joey. i want to show him how wonderful he's looking.
MAJOR STEWART: before we take him away across the channel to face a million germans guns.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: yes. before that...
MAJOR STEWART: 4 a.m. start tomorrow - travelling with the dragoon guards and the royals. transport detachment - they'll need to be at the docks at 5 am. check all kit. battle orders: no polishing - buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons - let `em all go dull. i want nothing to flash in the sun and give us away.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: of course.
MAJOR STEWART: charlie...
CHARLIE WAVERLY: jamie.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: charlie.
43.: charlie checks his new cap in the mirror.
CHARLIE WAVERLY: what do you think of the cap?
CHARLIE WAVERLY: silk lining. i quite like it.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: i'm not sure it's going to make a lot of difference to the germans.
CHARLIE WAVERLY: oh, i don't know about that. think about it - you're a boche, just working out which of two chaps to shoot - and you thought - "good lord - one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed!" you might shoot the other one instead.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: or, alternatively, think - "i fancy that cap" and kill you first of all. pause. charlie removes the cap.
CHARLIE WAVERLY: hadn't thought of that.

SGT. MAJOR SINGH: that is our target - the german 11th division - at the moment bivouacked three miles to the east of the menin road. we have been watching them and they have pitched tents for the night and lit cooking fires. knock them out - and we could slide in behind the german lines and come at them from the south at geluveld. 
MAJOR STEWART: excellent.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: numbers?
SGT. MAJOR SINGH: about six hundred. infantry.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: twice our size...
MAJOR STEWART: in regiments of horse and men, the advantage is ours.
SGT. MAJOR SINGH: and we have surprise on our side. but the sooner we move, the better - we have no assurance they'll still be there tomorrow morning.
MAJOR STEWART: right. good. so - today it is.
CHARLIE WAVERLY: salisbury formation?

MAJOR STEWART: salisbury formation. we'll charge through them and secure the ground behind. 
SGT. MAJOR SINGH: the grass to the left is taller than we are - it's perfect cover.
MAJOR STEWART: excellent work, sergeant major. time spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: thank you, singh.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: jamie!
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: they have no idea we're coming.
MAJOR STEWART: not having scruples, are you, jim?
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: no. i understand the surprise is everything. but if it must be done, let's do it quickly.
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: are you alright, charlie?
CHARLIE WAVERLY: never been better. literally, never better. we worry for him - he is afraid.
MAJOR STEWART: prepare to mount! mount!

CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: thank you, standley. 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: hey, joey. my bonny boy. you're all right, aren't you, joey? hey?
MAJOR STEWART: gentleman. it is an honour to ride beside you. make the kaiser rue the day he dared to cross swords with us. let every man make himself, his king, his country, and his fallen comrades proud! be brave. fear honor the king!
TROOPERS: fear honor the king!

MAJOR STEWART: draw swords! 
CAPTAIN NICHOLLS: good luck, my friends.
MAJOR STEWART: forward, to walk! walk...march! the regiment begins moving through the field.

MAJOR STEWART: forward to canter! canter...march! 
GERMAN SOLDIER: kavallerie!

JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER.: what do we do with the horses? 
GERMAN OFFICER: if they're injured, shoot them.
JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER: and the others, sir?
GERMAN OFFICER: the others you round up and take to base camp - they will pull guns.
THIRD OFFICER: you'll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns.
GERMAN OFFICER: then shoot them also.
GUNTHER: sir - perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances - to get the injured men off the field.
GERMAN OFFICER: will they take the harness?
GUNTHER: i'd like to try, sir.

MICHAEL: it won't work - they're cavalry 
GUNTHER: let's try.
MICHAEL: you won't get the harness on.
GUNTHER: come on, michael.
GUNTHER: whoa, whoa. easy, now, easy now, englishman... whoa, whoa, whoa.
MICHAEL: gunther! it's hopeless - we can't help them.
GUNTHER: well, well, look at you. whoever taught you this has just saved your life.

SI EASTON: hello the farm! 
ROSIE: looking up, wiping her
BROW): hello, si easton!
SI EASTON: i was at the post office and while i was there, mrs. allen said a parcel had come for albert, from the, from the, from over there - and i thought i could go up that way in the morning. and - here it is.

ALBERT: "in action," it says.
BASE CAMP OFFICER.: gentlemen! we move forward to the frontline tonight. full marching orders. get moving!
BASE CAMP OFFICER: schroeder! schroeder!
BASE CAMP OFFICER: no, not you - you. come.

BASE CAMP OFFICER: i'm keeping you here. you are best with the horses and we need to move the camp quickly if the enemy continue to push through from the west. 
GUNTHER: they're pushing through?
BASE CAMP OFFICER: i'm told. we will move later when we find where the horses are needed most.
GUNTHER: yes, sir. perhaps i can keep my brother here with me, he's also very good with horses.
BASE CAMP OFFICER: oh no no. not necessary.
BASE CAMP OFFICER: get moving. we leave tonight.
MICHAEL: it's all right, gunther.

GUNTHER: you are not going. i'll tell them you are only fourteen, that you're a boy. 
MICHAEL: father signed me in. he knew my age -and so do they.

MICHAEL: mother obviously never taught you how to fold a shirt. 
GUNTHER: of course she did. i just wasn't listening. but you need to listen now! i promised her, i made her a solemn promise, that you would be safe with me. with me, michael!!
GUNTHER: they'll never make a head count. there are too many of us. you can stay here - slip underneath the bed - until they move out.
MICHAEL: then what?
MICHAEL: gunther, it will be fine. and when all the machines break down and they call up the horses, i'll see you at the front. we'll be together again.
MICHAEL: gunther...
GUNTHER: i'm giving this to you. for luck.
GUNTHER: to keep you safe.

BASE CAMP OFFICER: im schnellschritt! marsch...links! zwei, drei, vier! 
GERMAN OFFICER: get back in line! line!

MICHAEL: i'm hungry. did you bring food? 
GUNTHER: i'm sorry.
MICHAEL: will father be ashamed?
GUNTHER: he will pretend to be. maybe at first he will be. but in the end, he will be glad.
MICHAEL: and us? what about us?

MICHAEL: i was ready to go. i was proud to go. 
SMALL VOICE): i wanted to go.
MICHAEL: the food in italy is good.
GUNTHER: yes.
MICHAEL: what about the women?

GUNTHER: not as good as the food. 
MICHAEL: because...they've eaten too much of the food?
GUNTHER: you are too young for war. and you're too young for women!
MICHAEL: i don't feel so young. not anymore.
MICHAEL: michael.
MICHAEL: what?
GUNTHER: go to sleep - we have a big night of riding ahead. goodnight, michael.
MICHAEL: night night, gunther.

GERMAN SOLDIER: hei! in die windmã¼hle! 
GUNTHER: go, go, go...
MICHAEL: okay.

BASE CAMP OFFICER: schroeder. 
GUNTHER: yes, sir.
BASE CAMP OFFICER: a mistake?
GUNTHER: a promise.
BASE CAMP OFFICER: ja...

EMILIE: grandpã©re. 
EMILIE: it's closer today.
GRANDFATHER: the wind plays tricks with the noise - it's moving away from us.
EMILIE: i can hear it, grandpã©re, and there is no wind. you shouldn't lie to me.
GRANDFATHER: here. there is no wind here. but over there - a wind so strong it will lift you off the ground...
EMILIE: you lie about everything. you say you aren't worried but it's clear you are. i know the war is approaching but you say, "oh, it's just a trick of the wind."

GRANDFATHER: did i say that? 
EMILIE: you started lying when mama and papa went away.
EMILIE: they're dead. but you won't say so. do you think i'll die if you tell me the truth?
GRANDFATHER: the truth is - he feeds her a spoonful of the medicine.
GRANDFATHER: - you should speak to your elders with respect.
EMILIE: if you tell me the truth about the war, i will tell you the truth about the big horses i've been keeping in the windmill.
GRANDFATHER: now - who is the one telling lies!

GRANDFATHER: in the windmill? 
EMILIE: yes. they were standing in the windmill waiting for don quixote. this is franã§ois and this is claude .

GRANDFATHER: yeah. 
EMILIE: i named them after two boys who broke my heart last summer.
GRANDFATHER: they must belong to someone. horses like this don't just appear from a fairy-tale.
EMILIE: yes - i know, grandpã©re. they are not unicorns - so i will be fair and wait -- one day.
GRANDFATHER: emilie... emilie...
EMILIE: and if no one comes to get them by night-time, then they belong to me.
GRANDFATHER: emilie. look at me. you cannot ride.
EMILIE: mother used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall.
GRANDFATHER: yes. that's right. so it is settled?
GRANDFATHER: good girl.
EMILIE: it will only be settled when i decide which one to ride first.
GRANDFATHER: but it's - over my dead body!
EMILIE: at least i won't have long to wait.

EMILIE: eyes on me. no talking. 
EMILIE: today we learn to jump. did you know the french cleared one meter eighty- five at the paris olympics to win the gold medal? today we will beat that record.
EMILIE: this is your jump. when i call you....be very brave and leap over it.

EMILIE: leap over it! watch me. 
EMILIE: and now it's your --

EMILIE: he doesn't think we can do it. but we will show him, won't we? 
EMILIE: you are...very tall.
64.: before she can swing her leg over joey's back -
GRANDFATHER: you'll kill yourself.
EMILIE: only if you get in my way to make me fall.
GRANDFATHER: oh please, come off the ladd--
GRANDFATHER: find somewhere to hide them. and do it quickly!!!
GERMAN OFFICER: halt! und aussteigen!
GRANDFATHER: my name is bonnard - this is my land. why are you here?
SOLDIERS: food for the soldiers at the front. everyone must give their share.

GRANDFATHER: they are taking everything. where are the horses? 
EMILIE: what horses?
GERMAN SOLDIER: what is it?
GRANDFATHER: leave it if you don't know what it's for.
GERMAN SOLDIER: a pot is a pot. we'll find some use for it. sir, where's the livestock?
GRANDFATHER: i make jam. we have no animals.
GERMAN SOLDIER: but there's fresh hay in your barn.
EMILIE: we use it to replace the mattress stuffings.
GERMAN SOLDIER: her grandfather?

GRANDFATHER: yes. 
GERMAN SOLDIER: where are her parents?
EMILIE: they're dead. they died.
GERMAN SOLDIER: what is that?
GRANDFATHER: the wind. it plays tricks in the attic.
BRANDT: there is no wind.
GRANDFATHER: an old house creaks.
GRANDFATHER: go - close the shutters.
GERMAN SOLDIER: she's sickly, no?
GRANDFATHER: if you or any of your friends harm her, as old as i am, i will kill you.
GERMAN SOLDIER: you know, i was going to give you back your pot. but now i'm going to keep it. for soup.

EMILIE: tell me what happened to them. to my mother and father. 
EMILIE: you said you would tell me how they died. on my birthday. and tomorrow's my birthday! they died fighting, didn't they? but when the soldiers
EMILIE: - you do nothing. you are a coward, aren't you?
GRANDFATHER: yes. yes. it was your parents who were brave. i make jams.
EMILIE: and you've never done a brave thing in your life?
GRANDFATHER: maybe there are different ways to be brave. did you know the french have the best carrier pigeons? and this could be the difference in the war - our messages getting through.

EMILIE: i don't want to hear about the birds. 
GRANDFATHER: they are released at the front and told to go home - this is all they know. but to get there they must fly over a war. can you imagine such a thing? here you are flying over so much pain and terror - and you know you can never look down. you have to look forward or you'll never get home. i ask you - what could be braver than that?

EMILIE: what is that? 
GRANDFATHER: a present.
EMILIE: i hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that i then have to wear like last year.
GRANDFATHER: it was disgusting?
EMILIE: yes. i looked like an ugly nun.

EMILIE: give me your hand. grandpã©re, we have no money. when the war is over, then you can buy me jewels and carriages. 
GRANDFATHER: anything you say, my sweet one. anything-you-say! you are, of course, the boss. it's just an old thing i found - don't worry yourself - leave it, i'll put it back.

GRANDFATHER: it was your mother's. i hid it, so as not to encourage you. emilie, i want you to ride very slowly, very carefully. and promise me you won't go far -- 
EMILIE: of course. okay, i promise.
GRANDFATHER: to the top of the hill and straight back again.
EMILIE: i promise.

EMILIE: my hero. 
GRANDFATHER: slowly...slowly...
GRANDFATHER: emilie!
GRANDFATHER: emilie!

GRANDFATHER: she is my granddaughter! emilie, stop! don't hurt her, please! don't hurt her. a soldier roughly shoves emilie at him. 
EMILIE: you don't need them! there are so many others!
GRANDFATHER: please, take the bigger one and leave the smaller one. you are breaking my granddaughter's heart.
BRANDT: the war has taken everything from everyone.
GRANDFATHER: what will happen to them?
BRANDT: they will pull artillery until they

EMILIE: franã§ois! 
BRANDT: - or until the war is over.
GRANDFATHER: it will never be over!
BRANDT: you have your answer then.

BRANDT: heiglemann - these are yours. 
FRIEDRICH: yes, sir.
BRANDT: they look strong - should last a month or two.
FRIEDRICH: you are beautiful.
FRIEDRICH: it's a pity they found you.
FRIEDRICH: such a pity...

ARTILLERY OFFICER: pull together! 
ARTILLERY SOLDIER: halt! halt! stop!
FRIEDRICH: stop! stop!
BRANDT: heiglemann, bring up another one!
ARTILLERY OFFICER: heiglemann, bring up another horse!
BRANDT: that one!
BRANDT: no, no. the big black one!
74.: as he reaches brandt:
FRIEDRICH: he's a good horse, sir. but if you move him up to the heavy gun, he will be no use at all. prince is already losing condition. his leg, sir.
BRANDT: you have given them names?
FRIEDRICH: yes, sir.
BRANDT: you should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose.
FRIEDRICH: his leg is not good enough, sir.
BRANDT: private, you will do as you are told.
BRANDT: hook him up.
FRIEDRICH: as you see, sir, this one is stronger.
BRANDT: hook him up.

OFFICER: halt! halt! take the horses away! 
ARTILLERY OFFICER: shell!
ARTILLERY OFFICER: and load!
ARTILLERY OFFICER: back! case!
ARTILLERY OFFICER: position!
ARTILLERY OFFICER: and...fire!

91.: the geordie nods.
GEORDIE: you speak good english.
PETER: i speak english well. may i?

GEORDIE: we need a vet, sir.
DOCTOR: there are no vets. we've scarcely any horses left.
GEORDIE: he's cut all over, but this leg here's got the worst of it.
DOCTOR: it's probably tetanus. it's no good.
GEORDIE: please, sir -
DOCTOR: i've all these men to take care of, corporal, you can see that, can't you?
GEORDIE: please, sir, this horse can pull through anything.

AN ORDERLY: it's a horse they found, wandering about in no man's land. 
AN ORDERLY: down you go.
ALBERT: what kind of an horse?
AN ORDERLY: miraculous kind of an horse, be my guess. nothing makes it out of no man's land.
ALBERT: miraculous horse...

GEORDIE: he was alive, y'see, sir, where nothing survives, so to me and me mates, to the men, sir, he's - well, we have high hopes for him - 
DOCTOR: you should shoot him now.
GEORDIE: oh, but i can't.
