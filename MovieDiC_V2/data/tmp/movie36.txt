speaker1: once we lived in an enchanted world. . . 
speaker1: a world of tsars and princesses and elegant palaces. . .
speaker1: and grand parties. . .
speaker1: a beautiful, magical time. . .

speaker1: princess anastasia - you're late and it's all my fault! 
speaker2: don't worry, sonya, no one'll notice. . .
speaker3: someday my place will be out there!
speaker4: never! you're a peasant, dmitri! back in the kitchen

speaker1: why were you so late tonight 
speaker2: i was showing sonya something . . .
speaker1: what were you showing her?
speaker2: how to read.
speaker1: i thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
speaker2: i know, but i had to because . . .
speaker2: oh, grandmama, why do you have to go back to paris?
speaker1: it's where i've made my home but i do have something for you . . .

speaker1: "together in paris"! oh, when can we be "together in paris?! 
speaker2: when you're older . . .
speaker2: until then, whenever you hear this song, think of me and know that i'm waiting for you.

speaker1: as he gathers his son and wife to his side 
speaker1: rasputin! you're alive . . .
speaker2: despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . .

speaker1: i had nothing to do with it! 
speaker2: you gave the orders!
speaker1: i did no such thing!
speaker2: after all i've done for your family - you tried to kill

speaker1: we're not afraid of you! 
speaker2: you . . . my little babushka . . . you'll be so much fun to kill that i'll save you for last! twirling the reliquary again, the moans grow louder as bartok circles around his head. the smoke that emerges seems to have almosy a human shape to it.

speaker1: my music mox! 
speaker2: anastasia, no!

speaker1: hurry, child! 
speaker2: no - this way!
speaker2: go! run!! out the servant's quarters!
speaker2: go!
speaker2: go!
speaker2: no one's here! let's try the next room!

speaker1: hurry, grandmama! 
speaker2: get on! anastasia, get on!

speaker1: grab my hand! 
speaker2: don't let go!

speaker1: anya! anya! 
speaker2: you can't get away from me now . . .
speaker2: you! you did this!
speaker2: brats! there'll be no supper for any of you! back to work!
speaker2: you ragged, skinny, little nothing! i have had just about enough of you . . . phlegmenkof raises her hand to slap anya, who hold her ground. suddenly, phlegmenkof sniffs the air.

speaker1: comrade serebreakov! she tries to straighten herself out nervously - this must be someone very important. comrade serebreakov stands in the doorway, lecherously 
speaker1: comrade serebreakov! what a lovely surprise! what brings you here?
speaker2: i need. . . a worker.
speaker2: i will take her.
speaker2: tomorrow you begin your life's work in my hearing factory. you'll start by cutting off the tails - but if i'm pleased with

speaker1: you - you just may move up to cutting off the heads. how does that sound? 
speaker2: about as bad as you smell!
speaker3: no, no, comrade - you don't want her . . .
speaker1: i want her.
speaker3: that's horrible, skinny thing?! she's crazy - she has no memory of anything before she came here! she didn't even know her name! that one is a rotten troublemaker, willful. . .
speaker1: i'll break her will. . . i shall come for you tomorrow at dawn. you will enjoy serving under me.
speaker3: i couldn't break you - but he can!

speaker1: anya? 
speaker1: are you running away?
speaker2: no. i'm running
speaker2: to find my home.
speaker3: but you are home.
speaker2: no. this isn't a home - it's just a building. home is where you belong and none of us belong here.
speaker1: where is your home, anya?
speaker2: i'm not sure but look. . . anya shows gregor the key around her neck. close up on the inscription: "together in paris"
speaker2: it says "together in paris". i was wearing this when i came here ten years ago - it's the only way that i know . . .
speaker2: . . . that i must have been someone someone loved.
speaker3: is your home in paris?
speaker2: it might be. i have to go and find out.
speaker1: but what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
speaker2: then you'll have to make your own home. lots of people do.
speaker1: anya! what if

speaker1: could someone tell me. . . 
speaker2: end of the line!
speaker1: which line?
speaker3: any line.
speaker4: all lines are good lines.
speaker5: in our beloved soviet union! they turn toward an armed soviet guard and smile sweetly, hoping he heard their flattery. he did.
speaker6: very good. . .

speaker1: is this the right line to get papers to travel? 
speaker2: travel? travel to where?
speaker1: to paris. i have to get to paris peasant 5, in front of her, turns around.
speaker3: paris?! what do they have in paris that they don't have here?
speaker4: shorter lines?!
speaker1: is this where i get traveling papers?
speaker5: it would be if we let you travel which we don't so it isn't. russia is the people's paradise!
speaker5: see dmitri. he can help.
speaker5: but you didn't hear it from me.
speaker1: i didn't he opens it again.
speaker5: no.

speaker1: which line is this? 
speaker2: the line to get into the line.
speaker3: excuse me, do you know dmitri. . .
speaker1: i know nothing!
speaker2: nothing!
speaker4: try the tavern/ library.
speaker5: but we didn't tell you!
speaker3: i wish they'd all stop telling me they didn't tell me! meetoo gives a "retu" of agreement. anya looks down and sees him.
speaker3: what are you doing. . .
speaker6: could you get rid of her moustache?
speaker3: excuse me - i'm looking for a man named dmitri. . .
speaker7: but i didn't write it.
speaker8: "st. petersburg art theatre - 99 pushkin street"

speaker1: vladimir, calm down! 
speaker2: this, my friend, as an exercise in futility! we shall never find a girl to play the princess anastasia out of this motley crew of commoners!
speaker1: for a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. this is the big one. . . and all i need is the right girl.
speaker3: oh, grandmama! it's me, anastasia. i've waited so long to see you.
speaker1: next!
speaker4: oh. . . grandmama it's me. anastasia, i have waited so long, too. see you!
speaker1: next!
speaker5: oh. . . grandmama. . . it's me. . .
speaker1: next!

speaker1: i wouldn't be on the outside anymore. the ten million rubles would make me welcome anywhere. i'd really belong somewhere - if i could just find the right girl. 
speaker2: oh, grandmama. . .
speaker1: next!
speaker3: what's my modivation?

speaker1: stanislavski! 
speaker2: shrugs innocently.
speaker3: next!
speaker4: oh. . .
speaker3: i've gotta find the right girl!

speaker1: it's no use, dmitri - we'll never find the right girl! 
speaker2: we will. we

speaker1: she could be right under our nose 
speaker1: ouch! that really hurt!

speaker1: i'm sorry. . . i'm. . . 
speaker2: that's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
speaker1: i'm looking for dmitri. i need traveling papers - to paris. i heard dmitri could help me. vladimir and dmitri exchange a look. . . wary. . . dmitri looks around and motions to vladimir to handle it while he walks ahead nonchalantly.
speaker3: who did you hear it from?
speaker1: i heard it from everyone who said i didn't hear it from them! do you know dmitri?
speaker3: providing travel papers is illeagal! i know dmitri well - perhaps i can help you. providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
speaker1: well, i don't have any money . . .
speaker3: good day! vladimir pats her on the head and walks away.
speaker1: i have a bike! perhaps i could sell it and. . .
speaker1: what are you doing here? and where's my bike?
speaker1: officer! my bike has been stolen!
speaker4: nonsense. there is no crime in the soviet socialist republic.
speaker1: sorry, boy, i have to go.
speaker1: no. you can't come with me. i'm leaving. . .
speaker1: it sounds like you're saying "me too". listen little guy, i have money, no food. . . and no bicycle. i'm the last person you should be following!

speaker1: . . . even if we find her, what makes you think the empress will even see us? 
speaker2: she'll see us.

speaker1: what was that? 
speaker2: that was your dinner! i do hope there is no cabbage in paris!

speaker1: whatta' ya say we go somewhere - maybe get a bug to eat. get it? a "bug" to eat, 'cause we're. . . 
speaker1: i'm a gemini. . .
speaker2: anya climbs into the ballroom.

speaker1: you're trespassing, boy! 
speaker2: i. . . i. . . spoke to you earlier about traveling paper. .
speaker3: it's her.
speaker1: he's her?
speaker3: look!
speaker2: are you dmitri? i didn't mean to trespass - i don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me. . .
speaker1: perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and. . .
speaker3: she doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
speaker1: ew. . . the honest type.
speaker3: you look like her. like the princess anastasia. has anyone ever told you that before?
speaker2: oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly told me i looked like a princess! stop that!
speaker3: people say anastasia was the only member of the royal family to escape alive. that makes her an orphan too

speaker1: what happened to your parents? 
speaker2: i don't know - i don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
speaker1: you know, it's strange - anastasia's grandmother, the dowager empress tatiana has been looking for anastasia since the revolution. why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
speaker2: i don't know. i don't see what this has to do with me.
speaker1: perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
speaker3: how much do you weigh?
speaker3: i was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
speaker2: look, i came here to get papers to travel to paris and. . .
speaker1: why do you want to go to paris?
speaker2: i have my reasons.
speaker1: anastasia's grandmother is in paris. we're going to bring anastasia to her - in paris.

speaker1: you never thought of the possibility? 
speaker2: look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . look at me!

speaker1: find out the truth - come to paris with us. 
speaker2: all right. i will go with you.
speaker1: the her royal highness princess anastasia!
speaker3: oy. . . he's gonna be so mad. . .

speaker1: find out the truth - come to paris with us. 
speaker2: all right. i will go with you.
speaker1: the her royal highness princess anastasia!
speaker3: oy. . . he's gonna be so mad...

speaker1: ummm ... father gregori? it's, uhh ... me. bartok. phew! not home ... 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: oh my don't do that ... feel my heart.
speaker2: and what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
speaker1: name calling! that's mature.
speaker2: i gave you that tongue and i can rip it out!
speaker1: no, i really like my tongue... we're very attached. oyyyy... okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
speaker2: why would i ever be angry with you, little friend?
speaker1: yeah, right. keep that thought okay? so, i'm in town, stop by the old palace. you get a better class of bats there - no tattoos or anything.
speaker1: so, i'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can i say, i struck out. i thought chicks would like the fact that i can talk, you know but, i mean, the way things are going i couldn't get invited to a plague. someone's gotta clean that up...
speaker2: get to the point sometime tonight..
speaker1: okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like anastasia is ... still alive.
speaker2: impossible. that rumor's been around for years.
speaker1: trust me, it's her!
speaker2: how do you know?
speaker1: rodent's intuition, how do i know? she looks exactly like her. except she's taller, which is natural ... of course my second cousin treplev - he never grew. looks like a little pepper shaker. he was so cute ...
speaker1: oyyy... i knew this was gonna to upset him!
speaker2: source of my power. owner of my soul. i need your help.
speaker1: hey, she's just a kid. and she's going to paris outta sight, outta mind, outta russia.
speaker2: i cursed then all!
speaker1: my aunt bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "curses were made to be broken". course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
speaker1: you know, this is really obsessive behavior. there is this doctor this doctor in austria, sigmund something and he feels. . .

speaker1: do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?! 
speaker2: you'd lose your security deposit?
speaker1: evil, powerful beings - i have their power only if i contain them, control them. if they should all be released at once... well ...

speaker1: where is she? where is princess anastasia... 
speaker1: she has friends. no matter...
speaker2: ohhh, that was dumb...
speaker2: hello, i've get really terrible claustrophobia. that's why i could never live in a cave ...
speaker1: finish my prophecy...
speaker2: ew, i hate when he does this!
speaker1: she is not to get off that train... alive!

speaker1: haven't anything better to do than to break my heart. 
speaker1: no more. so more...
speaker2: oh, oh... i must say. i thought that one was bar - i'm just so shocked that she wasn't real well, she was real, i mean she was human, of course. but not our real. i must say, even my sisters were touched by her yes - yes they were... xenia and estelle, as pinched and skinny as sophie in "full", don't appear to ever have been "touched" by anything .
speaker2: ... moved to tears of joy! we won't be ooled next time, girls! i'm a going to think of really hard questions...
speaker1: no, sophie. my heart can't take it anymore! i will see no more girls claiming to be anastasia.

speaker1: hurry up with those papers. 
speaker2: would you have leaned over rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
speaker2: you probably would. they're still wet. a train whistle slows and vlad moves to anya.
speaker2: wake up, young lady, that's our train.
speaker1: "wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
speaker2: what a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'your highness".
speaker1: wake up!
speaker3: we have a lot of work to do...

speaker1: come on! 
speaker1: take my hand!

speaker1: do you always punch people first thing in the morning? 
speaker2: sorry - it's a reflex. living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
speaker1: i wasn't bothering you. i was trying to wake you up!
speaker2: by pulling my hair?!
speaker1: i was all out of dynamite!
speaker2: put it on your nose. for heaven's sake, you're making such a fuss!
speaker2: men are such babies...
speaker2: here, let me dmitri and vlad both pull her back down.
speaker1: you're a princess...
speaker3: royalty do not help people with their luggage.
speaker3: well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
speaker1: yes. and i hate that in a woman.
speaker4: papers!
speaker3: it's what i hate about this government - everything in red! the guard hand papers back to a soulful looking man with a frozen beard.
speaker4: thank you, comrade zhivago.
speaker5: doctor zhivago.
speaker3: what do we do now?
speaker1: pray he's color-blind...
speaker4: wait here.

speaker1: i'm going to stretch my legs 
speaker2: that's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs ... stretch then that way.
speaker1: i must have hit him harder than i thought... dmitri runs back in and grabs his small backpack. he pulls vlad, carrying meetoo, out off the compartment anya has a load on them as they follow.

speaker1: wait here! 
speaker1: come on up!
speaker2: why?

speaker1: just what do you think you're doing?! 
speaker2: trying... to... breathe...

speaker1: forged papers! now, what?! 
speaker2: now just get off the train.

speaker1: noooo.... 
speaker2: she's quite right, dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
speaker3: come on, we'll jump together... take my hand.
speaker3: come on!
speaker1: no!

speaker1: i think i have hurt my... 
speaker2: you must enjoy causing me pain!
speaker3: you shouldn't have pushed us!
speaker1: is everyone all right?
speaker3: i'm fine.
speaker2: she's fine! i may never walk right again, but she's fine...

speaker1: she's too far away, isn't she? 
speaker1: yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. we must get close to her.
speaker2: oy... not a road trip. i get wagon sick, you know that.
speaker2: you're absolutely right. travel broadens your horizons...

speaker1: we'll catch her and finish her! we ride this night! 
speaker2: well, we wait this night!

speaker1: no have a lot of work to do, anya! come along, meetoo! 
speaker1: we have to prepare you for an audience with sophie.
speaker2: who's sophie?
speaker1: ah ... the lady sophie... the ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the empress. we must convince sophie that you are the princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the empress ... your grandmother, i mean.
speaker2: what?!
speaker2: you never said anything to me about having to prove i'm a princess!
speaker3: you are the princess.
speaker1: we're just going to refresh your memory...
speaker2: i don't have a memory and i'm not a princess! even if i were - no one's ever going to believe it. i'm not exactly...
speaker2: ... good enough... i can't go through with this!
speaker3: what do you see?

speaker1: see? the princess is under there ... 
speaker2: ah! let us begin!

speaker1: ...and on my father's side, there was [this section is not ledgable] anya thinks as dmitri looks at a long sheet of paper, prompting her. 
speaker2: every russian family has one..
speaker1: natasha! natasha feastavich!- but we called her nashie fooshie!
speaker3: did i tell you that?
speaker1: you must have.

speaker1: it's the best fork of all 
speaker2: the dessert fork!
speaker3: ah, yes ... i have always loved that fork... dmitri and anya exchange a look and then laugh, adding ad libs of "we can tell" and "there's a fork you should have skipped". this is the first time dmitri and anya have laughed together - actually the first time he's ever seen her smile.

speaker1: what a beautiful ship! 
speaker2: it used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
speaker3: oh, yes it was the seagoing vessel of elaborate elegance in entertaining... a party boat. it once belonged to ...
speaker1: konstantin petrovich of moscow!
speaker4: no, no, boys! you don't know where he's been!

speaker1: no! i look ridiculous! 
speaker2: come out! i can do alterations.
speaker1: you'll laugh.
speaker2: i shant!
speaker1: not you. him.
speaker3: i won't laugh - i swear...
speaker1: you said you wouldn't laugh!
speaker3: it's not you - it's the dress!

speaker1: i'm never going to be.. 
speaker1: well! maybe i am...

speaker1: i wanted to show you something. 
speaker2: it's so beautiful ... and sad.
speaker1: sad?
speaker2: lost. it feels lost. this was hers?
speaker1: yeah ... well, yours. you still don't believe that you're the princess, do you?
speaker2: i know i must have had something to do with the palace - i've had little flashes of things - but being the princess? it doesn't matter as long as i find my home.
speaker1: well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! you're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- i never had much, but what i did have -- i lost.
speaker2: i'm sorry.
speaker1: hey! it doesn't matter! you gotta make your own way in the world! don't be sorry for me! i'm going to get what i want don't you worry! dmitri goes back over to his bed. anya sees through him and knows how much it all did matter to him.

speaker1: she's out there ... 
speaker2: i'm getting a chest cold..
speaker1: bartok... a question.
speaker2: i'm getting pneumonia. i have a fever. feel my forehead...
speaker1: what do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
speaker2: my cousin mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way...

speaker1: ... anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - i know, cliche, but there you have it, and mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang 
speaker1: and it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either.

speaker1: what were you doing?! 
speaker1: it's okay now - i've got you. you're safe...
speaker2: boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
speaker3: she leads a charmed life, that little one ... someone is always there to save her. in the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him. rasputin studies dmitri in the reliquary - dmitri and anya still in a warm embrace.
speaker2: nice looking fellow. i mean, don't get me wrong - i'm not attracted to him in the physical sense, i just ...
speaker3: you are toying with me, aren't you? you let me get so close...
speaker3: bartok ... have you ever been to paris?
speaker2: me? no. rich food - it kills me. ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
speaker3: we are going to paris - and while we're there, let's kill the young man. he annoys me.

speaker1: oh! i'm sorry... 
speaker2: it's okay. didn't hurt..
speaker1: i'm almost there... i'm finally going to know...
speaker2: how is our current financial status?
speaker3: if i used the word "bleak" i would be optimistic.
speaker3: the "odessa dunk"?
speaker2: it worked in odessa...

speaker1: help! my little dogs! chevalier! maurice! hold on, darlings! dmitri comes running up, a little too gallant. 
speaker2: i'll save them, madame
speaker3: such bravery! why, that man should be rewarded! amply rewarded!

speaker1: that was really very kind of you. 
speaker2: i won't say a word...

speaker1: nervous? 
speaker2: yes - if i can't convince sophie, i'll never be able to see tatiana....
speaker1: you'll convince her. you have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.

speaker1: may i present her royal highness princess anastasia! 
speaker2: oh good! we haven't seen an anastasia in several days!

speaker1: i'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear... 
speaker2: of course.
speaker1: where were you born?

speaker1: the real anastasia couldn't have grown up to be lovelier. 
speaker2: this is the hard one ... what rare treat was served on the night of the three hundredth anniversary of the romanov dynasty? the last ball they ever had? dmitri and vladimir exchange a nervous look. it's obvious they never briefed anya on this one. anya thinks a moment, then looks up, smiling, as she remembers ...
speaker3: father had fresh tropical fruits sent in. oranges and pineapples from the far east. i remember ... i remember i threw an orange to a young boy who was hiding under a table...
speaker2: yes ... yes, it was fresh fruit. well, maybe not "fresh" estelle got one rather brown banana but ...

speaker1: are you impressed with our anastasia? 
speaker2: oh, heavens - i must say, yes.
speaker1: then, you'll take her to see tatiana?
speaker2: oh, heavens i must say... no, no actually, i can't - tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
speaker1: perhaps you could convince her?
speaker2: oh, heavens, no... but ... she is going to be at the ballet russe tonight! that's the russian ballet - russe for russian, oh those crazy french... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
speaker2: come my dear, we've much to talk about.

speaker1: we did it! we did it, my boy! we're going to see tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! 
speaker2: but it's not the money, vlad.
speaker1: are you feeling all right?
speaker3: but you never doubted who i was, did you, dmitri? not for a second ... anya gratefully kisses dmitri an the cheek and runs into the house. vladimir, who's been watching, has a warning.
speaker1: life is funny, isn't it. you find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: dmitri ... you must understand that once you take her to tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. she's a princess and you're a commoner.

speaker1: lovers! 
speaker2: ooh la la!

speaker1: sorry, it's just... you know i saw these french postcards once and... ooh la la ... well, i'm not sure about the "ooh", but it's the "la la" i'm really lookin' forward to... right, i'm shutting up. 
speaker2: we're close to her, aren't we?
speaker2: excited, eh? you look about to burst ... you'd like to burst, wouldn't you?
speaker2: no, no, no. we made a bargain. someday you'll have me for all eternity. till then... i'm in charge.
speaker1: what do you think? is it me?

speaker1: compliments of sophie. her has to look his best. 
speaker2: how do i look?
speaker3: fine. we better go.

speaker1: dancers in bright costumes leap across the stage. 
speaker2: look. there is your grandmother...

speaker1: come on. it's time.. 
speaker2: i'm so scared...
speaker1: don't be
speaker2: and grateful. to you. if it weren't for you --
speaker1: i know.

speaker1: how much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?! 
speaker2: please, if you'd just listen...
speaker1: remove him at once.
speaker2: please! empress! it's not what you ....
speaker2: anya. . . please. . .

speaker1: anya, wait! 
speaker2: tell me it isn't true?! tell me you didn't do this for the money!
speaker1: no! well, yes, but
speaker2: no! i thought you believed in me! it was all a lie!

speaker1: sir! your rear tire is flat! 
speaker2: it is?
speaker3: ulo! slow down!
speaker1: i'm not ulo and i won't slow down.
speaker3: you! how dare you?! stop this car immediately!
speaker4: tatiana's car flying down small streets.

speaker1: stop this car! 
speaker2: please don't be afraid! i'm sorry, but there was no other way!
speaker2: look at this!
speaker1: anastasia's music box... she had this all these years... you could have found it...
speaker2: what i
speaker3: anya holding meetoo in front of the window.
speaker4: reacting to how much she looks like anastasia.
speaker5: go away!
speaker1: who are you, child?
speaker5: i don't know! i don't want to hurt you...
speaker1: do you remember this?
speaker5: i remember something lost ... i'm so confused! oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! do you think i could have... belonged to you ...
speaker1: oh! where did you get that?!
speaker5: i've always had it... i came here because of this! tell me if you recognize it! please! it's all i have...

speaker1: ... and that christmas dinner, when cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! i do remember so much now, grandmama, - but not everything. 
speaker2: don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
speaker3: yesss ... finally "home". and what a charming ... girlish little home it is. look, bartok, little angels, the symbol of ... love. so sweet, so harmless.
speaker3: let's go for a touch of irony, shall we?

speaker1: and there will be no blood on my hands ... 
speaker1: nooooooo!
speaker2: anastasia! it was just a bat!
speaker3: no, it wasn't a bat! i saw this horrible man - i remember him, i think...
speaker2: no, no child... shush... it's all right ... she embraces anya, who is still terrified and knows that she saw what she saw.

speaker1: a grand ball for the princess. how very exciting. so much to do, so little time... 
speaker2: do it somewhere else, please. quietly.
speaker1: caterers ... invitations ... saber dancers! we must have saber dancers!
speaker3: beeg. zat is how you say it.
speaker4: and the crown she is ... how you say?
speaker3: small! zat is "how you say" it! don't be so french, pierre wit the "how you say" all za time - zat is really annoying.
speaker2: you are going to make a beautiful princess.
speaker2: lovely... what troubles you, child?
speaker5: madame, your... eh... guest has arrived.
speaker2: thank you, vladimir.,
speaker5: anya... anastasia... i'm sorry ... we didn't mean to hurt you ...

speaker1: i sent for you because i owe you a debt of gratitude larger than i can ever repay 
speaker2: no. empress, you --
speaker1: i want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
speaker2: empress, no! i will not take the money! i just came to tell you i was sorry...
speaker1: young man, i...
speaker2: ... and i'm going to keep my promise to stay out of your lives, forever.
speaker1: you are the boy ...
speaker2: i should go
speaker1: that last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. you were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you? please, is there nothing i can do to repay you?
speaker2: promise me she'll have her home.
speaker1: she does.
speaker2: and tell me that she's happy.
speaker1: oh, dmitri.i wish that i could.
speaker2: i'm glad you found what you were looking for.
speaker3: i'm glad you did too.
speaker3: enjoy your fortune.

speaker1: but this invitation came from the empress herself! it's the social event of the decade! you can't turn it down! 
speaker2: watch me.
speaker1: so where will you go?
speaker2: she found her home. maybe it's time i found one too!

speaker1: so. you don't want to go to the coronation, eh? 
speaker2: rasputin!
speaker1: i know, i know ... you thought i was dead. that's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of russia, which i should have been - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.

speaker1: what do you want?! 
speaker2: the same thing i wanted ten years ago - all the romonovs dead i got the others, now i have to finish up with that nuisance, anastasia...
speaker1: you're insane! you didn't kill the romonovs - it was the...

speaker1: look at me... look at me! 
speaker1: you are going to help me kill her... you are going to help me kill her...

speaker1: ... then as i say "her serene highness princess anastasia" you, your highness, should walk out on to the stage and greet your ... 
speaker2: i believe her highness understands what she has to do.
speaker2: don't you, child?
speaker3: oh, yes, grandmama - i wait until i hear...
speaker2: no, not about the ceremony, anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
speaker3: there's no choice...
speaker4: your "guest" is unable to attend. tatiana is troubled by this news. anya starts laughing when she sees meetoo.
speaker3: oh, meetoo! you look miserable!
speaker4: yes, your highness.
speaker3: poor meetoo!
speaker4: yes, your highness.
speaker3: cut it out, vlad! i'm not angry with you anymore - i know how much you needed the money.
speaker2: but they didn't take the money - either one of them. i offered it to them, but they both refused.
speaker3: dmitri didn't want the money?
speaker2: no, he just wanted to know you were happy.
speaker4: fortunately, i am to be married. with your highness, permission.
speaker3: vlad, stop acting this way! you're my friend!
speaker4: no. from now on i am your loyal subject ... your highness. by your leave?
speaker3: why does everyone have to act that way?
speaker2: you'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
speaker3: "if" i accept?! of course i'm going to accept! it's what i always wanted!
speaker2: is it? is this what you want?
speaker3: i wanted to come home, grandmama - and i did. i came back to my home with you.
speaker2: you can't go back to find your home. your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
speaker3: and this is my future. this is who i am!
speaker2: this is who you were. exactly who you are is up to you.

speaker1: i don't know who i am! 
speaker2: yes, you do. you do.
speaker2: and in your heart, you know what is right for you.

speaker1: i've spent my whole life waiting to find you ... 
speaker2: and we have found each other nothing will ever change that! i am your family, dear child, but i may not be your home.

speaker1: the princess anastasia. but not anya. 
speaker2: her serene highness, the princess anastasia! pause. we hear mummers from the crowd outside, various "where's anastasia?", then
speaker3: anya!
speaker3: anya ...

speaker1: look, bartok. most of them were there the night i made this curse. now, they'll get to see it finished! revenge is a dish best served... in front of a larrrrrge audience! 
speaker1: do not despair. i'll make sure your beloved princess drops in.
speaker2: ahh, very witty. there's this english guy - noel coward - i'll bet he's quaking ...

speaker1: dmitri? 
speaker1: dmitri ... grandmama told me.
speaker1: dmitri, what's wrong?
speaker2: throw her off the edge! do it!
speaker3: sees rasputin.
speaker4: orange flash of gunshots
speaker1: dmitri ... look at me! it's anya! it's anya!
speaker1: you saved my life in the palace! you won't take it now...

speaker1: dmitri. i know you would never hurt me. you love me. 
speaker1: dmitri?
speaker2: anya... where are we?
speaker1: i guess you aren't as powerful as you thought!
speaker3: i'll show you!
speaker2: run, anya - go...
speaker1: i'm not leaving you!
speaker3: fighting for fair lady. how noble...
speaker3: and how pathetic.
speaker3: that's only going to make you fall farther.
speaker2: anya!

speaker1: take my hand! hurry! 
speaker2: don't let me go!
speaker1: i'll never let go!
speaker3: their hands, gripping one another.
speaker4: what a touching sentiment...
speaker4: this little piggy had a palace... this little piggy had a throne...
speaker4: this little piggy missed the firing squad..
speaker4: and this little piggy wanted a home... and this little piggy went wee wee wee all the way... down!

speaker1: come on... i'll take you home. 
speaker2: i am home.
