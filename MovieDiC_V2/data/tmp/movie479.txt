speaker2: name's ethan... now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
speaker1: well, fust off...
speaker3: look! look!

speaker1: call that young fool back! 
speaker1: caddo or kiowa, huh?... ain't but one tribe uses a lance like that!
speaker2: ay-he... comanch!
speaker3: killed every one -- an' not for food either... why'd they do a thing like that?
speaker1: stealing the cattle was just to pull us out... this here's a murder raid... it shapes up to scald out either your place... or my brother's.
speaker4: mama!... oh please... please no...

speaker1: jorgensen's place is closest... if they're not there, we'll come straight on! 
speaker2: well, come on!
speaker3: easy! it's forty miles, sonny... horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
speaker4: comanch generally hits at moonrise.
speaker2: moonrise!... it'll be midnight before... i ain't waitin'...!
speaker4: wisht it was caddoes... or kiowas... comanche...

speaker1: think i'll see if i can pick off a sage-hen or two, martha... 
speaker2: you do that, aaron...
speaker1: won't go far...

speaker1: my, the days are getting shorter! 
speaker2: lucy!... we don't need the lamp yet...
speaker2: let's enjoy the dusk a while.

speaker1: mind you sweep up them shavin's. 
speaker2: yes, pa... an' if you see any sage-hens, i'm ready.

speaker2: pa?
speaker3: where's deborah?...

speaker1: i'm sorry... i couldn't find the shawl... 
speaker2: hurry, martha... moon's fixin' to rise...
speaker3: we're going to play the sleep-out game... remember?... where you hide out with grandma?
speaker4: where's she buried?
speaker3: and you'll go along the ditch -- very quietly -- like a...
speaker4: like a little mouse.
speaker2: now!
speaker3: there!... and you won't come back or make a sound... no matter what you hear? promise!... no matter what?
speaker4: i promise... wait!
speaker2: child, child!
speaker4: can't i have topsy to keep me company?
speaker2: there's no time...
speaker3: here she is, baby... baby...
speaker2: down low -- go!
speaker2: here dog... here!
speaker2: she reached the ditch...
speaker2: she'll be all right, mother... she'll be all right.

speaker1: ethan!... ethan! 
speaker1: uncle ethan... it's me... martin!
speaker2: out of my way!

speaker1: mose! wait!... 
speaker1: ethan!... mose!...

speaker1: lucy?... deborah? lucy? 
speaker1: you stay out!
speaker1: nothing for you to see.
speaker2: leggo...
speaker1: don't let him go in there, mose...
speaker1: lucy -- lucy!

speaker1: ...and to your keeping we commend the souls of aaron... martha... and benjamin edwards... 
speaker1: man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble...
speaker1: he cometh forth like a...
speaker2: amen!... put an 'amen' to it!
speaker1: ...like a flower and is cut down...
speaker3: amen!
speaker1: charlie--you and brad ride point! ...don't get too far ahead...

speaker1: i'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am. 
speaker2: i am... i am... it's just that i know martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls... and if the girls are... dead... ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
speaker2: promise me, ethan!
speaker2: oh, martin... martin...
speaker3: we'll find them, mrs. jorgensen... we'll find them...
speaker2: i almost hope they don't find them!

speaker1: martin - next to last in file. finally: 
speaker2: ethan - his face a study of relentless purpose.

speaker1: another one, eh? 
speaker2: this 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
speaker1: well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, ethan.
speaker3: i don't like it.
speaker1: what don't you like?
speaker3: injun's on a raid generly hides their dead so you won't know how many they've lost... if they don't care about us knowin', it only spells one thing... they ain't afraid of us followin' -- or of us catchin' up with 'em either.
speaker4: you can back out any time, nesby.
speaker3: didn't say that... what's he doin' that for...
speaker2: he wants to be sure...
speaker5: let's get along...
speaker1: what good does that do?
speaker4: by what you preach... none!
speaker4: but by what the comanche believe -- now he can't enter the spirit land, but has got to wander forever between the winds... because i took his mangy scalp!

speaker1: could be a buffler... 
speaker2: it's horses, i tell ya...
speaker3: it's them all right...

speaker1: they're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before daybreak. 
speaker1: it's what we're here for, ain't it?
speaker2: i thought we were trying to get the girls back -- alive... we jump those comanches, they'll kill 'em... you know that!
speaker3: but... but what are we doin' then?...
speaker2: what i had in mind was runnin' off their hoss herd... a comanche on foot is more apt to be willin' to listen...
speaker4: that makes sense to me.
speaker5: yeah...
speaker1: what do you know about it?... what's a quarter-breed cherokee know about the comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him... you got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
speaker2: ...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... i say we do it my way, ethan... and that's an order!
speaker1: yes, sir... but if you're wrong, captain clayton, don't ever give me another!

speaker1: ay-he... they was here... 
speaker2: sure!... they were here... now they're out there... an' waitin' to jump us!...
speaker2: you got any more orders, captain?
speaker3: just keep goin'...

speaker1: keep goin'... 
speaker2: look!
speaker1: easy!

speaker1: if you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded. 
speaker2: how far's the river from here, mose?
speaker3: i been baptized, reverend... yes suh, been baptized, thank ye...
speaker2: well, you better brace yourself for another one... ya-hee!

speaker1: you think they mean to charge us, uncle ethan...? 
speaker2: ...we found us an ole buffler wallow...
speaker3: criminy!

speaker1: steady, daniel boone! you don't want to miss... it makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours... 
speaker2: ay-he... that's jest what i tole joe powers... that un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, ethan?
speaker1: real sassy.
speaker3: i didn't give any order to fire!
speaker1: that's all right, captain... i don't need any formal invitation to kill a comanch...
speaker3: you got one now!

speaker1: no, ethan. 
speaker2: let them bury their dead...

speaker1: that tears it, reverend... from now on, you keep out... all of you!... i don't want you with me... i don't need you... for what i got to do! 
speaker2: no need to shout, mister.
speaker2: reckon we got to go back -- ed's shoulder is smashed -- bad!
speaker3: i can make it... just get me on a horse...
speaker4: no good, ed... and ethan's right... this is a job for a company of rangers... or it's a job for one or two men... right now we're too many... an' not enough...
speaker5: only one way you can stop me lookin' for lucy, mister... an' that's kill me...
speaker6: that's how i feel, uncle ethan... ethan, sir.
speaker1: all right... but i'm givin' the orders... you take 'em or we split up here and now...
speaker6: why, sure, ethan... there's just the one thing we're after... finding deborah and lucy...
speaker1: if they're still alive...

speaker1: you boys got enough shells? 
speaker2: yeah...
speaker1: vaya con dios.

speaker1: they got to stop sometime... if they're human at all, they got to stop! 
speaker2: naw... a human man rides a horse till it dies... then he goes on afoot... a comanche comes along... gets that horse up... and rides it twenty more miles... then he eats it.
speaker2: easy on that!
speaker3: sorry... we don't even know if debbie 'n lucy are with this bunch... maybe they split up...
speaker2: they're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
speaker1: you've said that enough!... maybe lucy's dead... maybe they're both dead... but if i hear it from you again, i'll fight ya, mr. edwards!
speaker2: that'll be the day!... let's ride.

speaker1: four of 'em cut out here... why? 
speaker2: i'll take a look... you keep after the others...
speaker1: you want us to fire a shot if...

speaker1: oh... it's you. 
speaker1: i... uh... here's where they met up again...
speaker1: trail leads off there...
speaker2: why'd they break off? was there water in that canyon?
speaker1: huh...? no... no water.
speaker3: you all right, ethan?
speaker1: huh...? sure i'm all right...
speaker3: say!... what happened to your blanket? lose it?
speaker1: must've... anyway, i ain't goin' back to look for it...

speaker1: i saw her!... i saw lucy! 
speaker1: they're camped 'bout two miles over... i was just swingin' back when i saw their smoke... i bellied up a ridge an' they was right below me...
speaker2: did you see debbie?
speaker1: no, but i saw lucy all right... she was wearin' that blue dress... an' she was walkin' along...
speaker3: what you saw wasn't lucy.
speaker1: it was, i tell you!
speaker3: what you saw was a buck wearin' lucy's dress... i found lucy back there in that canyon... i wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands... i thought it best to keep it from you -- long as i could.
speaker1: did they...? was she...?
speaker4: they run for their horses.

speaker1: let's just hope he took some with him... 
speaker2: what you goin' to do?
speaker1: get some sleep... tomorrow's another day...

speaker1: say it. we're beat! 
speaker2: no... our turnin' back don't change anything... not in the long run. if she's alive, she's safe... for a while... they'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
speaker1: and you think we got a chance to find her?
speaker2: an injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough... then he quits... same when he runs... seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on... so we'll find them in the end, i promise you that... we'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.

speaker1: you got my letter about your son, brad? 
speaker2: yah... just about this time a year ago...
speaker3: it came the day before his... birthday.
speaker2: the lord giveth--the lord taketh away...
speaker4: i ain't fit to go indoors, miz jorgensen... these clothes is...
speaker5: martie!
speaker3: and him probably forgettin' all about you!... probably can't even call your name to mind.
speaker4: laurie. and laurie smiles triumphantly at her mother.
speaker3: the little one?... debbie?

speaker1: hey... what you doin'...? 
speaker1: don't go takin' that stuff...
speaker2: ain't worth the mendin'...
speaker2: what you gettin' red-in-the-face for?... i have brothers, haven't i?
speaker1: well i ain't one of 'em!
speaker2: i'm a woman, martie... we wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives... when you're little we even wash you... how a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman i'll never know...
speaker1: you talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
speaker2: wouldn't bother me... i wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was i you...

speaker1: ...an' then it snowed and we lost the trail... no need to tell ya all the places we went... fort richardson, fort wingate an' cobb... the anadarko agency... trouble is we don't even know which band that war party belonged to... 
speaker2: well, you did all a body could, ethan.
speaker1: i got your boy killed.
speaker2: don't go blamin' yourself...
speaker3: it's this country killed my boy!... yes, by golly!
speaker2: now lars!... it so happens we be texicans... we took a reachin' hold, way far out, past where any man has right or reason to hold on... or if we didn't, our folks did... so we can't leave off without makin' them out to be fools, wastin' their lives 'n wasted in the way they died... a texican's nothin' but a human man out on a limb... this year an' next and maybe for a hundred more. but i don't think it'll be forever. someday this country will be a fine good place to be... maybe it needs our bones in the ground before that time can come...
speaker4: ma!... martie's drawers is a sight! ain't fit for rags!... would it be all right if we gave him some of brad's things?
speaker2: why...'course it would! they're in the chest...
speaker1: mrs. jorgensen...
speaker1: will you look at this?
speaker2: why it's just a snip of calico...
speaker1: you ever see it before... like mebbe on a dress debbie wore?
speaker2: yes!... yes, i remember!... have they found her, ethan?
speaker1: no... not yet...
speaker1: ...not yet...

speaker1: might at least have left me my pants! 
speaker2: shush!... time for bed anyway... likely these'll need some takin' in... oh, martie, you're that gaunted! ...ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
speaker3: laurie!... come... come!
speaker2: yes, pa!... good night, martie... good night, mr. edwards...
speaker1: good night... laurie...
speaker4: good night...
speaker4: jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
speaker1: your cattle?... debbie's cattle! ethan returns the stare without any change of expression.
speaker4: he's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while i'm gone... i'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
speaker1: i ain't stayin'... i set out lookin' for debbie... i aim to keep on...
speaker4: why?
speaker1: because she's my... my...
speaker4: she's your nothin'... she's no kin to you at all!
speaker1: i always felt like she was... her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
speaker4: that don't make 'em kin...
speaker1: all right... i ain't got no kin... i'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
speaker4: how? you got any horses, or money to buy 'em... you ain't even got money to buy cartridges... jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
speaker4: martin... i want you to know somethin'...
speaker1: yeah... you want me to know i ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!... you tole me that already... now shut your head!
speaker4: good night.

speaker1: i don't know what you can do about finding debbie that he can't... 
speaker1: he'll find her now, martie... please believe me... i know.
speaker2: that's what scares me -- him findin' her.
speaker2: laurie, i've seen his eyes when he so much as hears the word 'comanche' ...i've seen him take his knife an' ...never mind... but he's a man can go crazy wild... it might come on him when it was the worst thing could be... what i counted on, i hoped to be there to stop him, if such thing come.
speaker2: 'i bought a small size dress off a injun... if this here is a piece of yr chiles dress bring reward. i know where they gone... jerem futterman.' martin is on his feet.
speaker2: futterman!... he's got a little tradin' post on the south fork o' the brazos... laurie, i just got to get me a good horse! think yer pa would...
speaker1: finish your breakfast...
speaker2: i gotta catch up with him, laurie!
speaker1: go on then! pa's in the barn saddlin' the fort worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
speaker2: but that's sweet-face -- your own good horse.
speaker1: take it and welcome... but don't count on finding me here when you get back... i've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you... i ain't cut out to be an old maid!

speaker1: drink? 
speaker2: how'd you come by this?
speaker1: you said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
speaker2: that's what i said.
speaker1: you got it with you?

speaker1: reward'll be paid when i find her -- an' if she's alive... futterman uncorks the jug, prepares to drink. 
speaker2: man's got a right to expect some kind o' payment... i laid out for the dress an' sendin' you the writin'...
speaker1: twenty yankee dollars.
speaker2: ...an' a man's time is worth somethin'...
speaker1: talk!
speaker2: a young buck fetched it in late last summer... said it belonged to a captive chile of chief scar...
speaker1: scar? never heard of any chief scar.
speaker2: me neither... but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches.
speaker1: keep talking.
speaker2: scar's band was headin' north... to winter in at fort wingate... eatin' agency beef. that's what this buck said... maybe he lied.
speaker1: and maybe you lie...
speaker2: in that case you won't find her -- and i won't get my thousand dollars.
speaker2: stay the night if you want... cards?... a jug?... if you'd like some company, we got a few squaws on the place...
speaker1: no thanks.
speaker2: don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
speaker1: ain't yours yet.
speaker2: bad manners... he shoulda said 'good- bye.'

speaker1: acts like somethin's out there. 
speaker2: smells a change in the weather...
speaker2: wouldn't surprise me if we didn't have a frost 'fore mornin'... here... whyn't you bed down closer to the fire, boy?
speaker3: hey! what's the idea...?
speaker2: maybe i'm gettin' like mose harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
speaker3: funny... when we passed through fort wingate last winter, we didn't hear mention of any nawyecky comanche there...
speaker2: not so funny... if you recollect what 'nawyecka' means...
speaker3: what's that?
speaker2: sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
speaker3: oh...
speaker2: you all settled an' comfortable now?

speaker1: thanks... you did just fine... 
speaker2: futterman?
speaker1: he just couldn't wait...
speaker2: whatchu doin'?...
speaker1: even got my twenty dollars back... we did all right.
speaker2: we?... you just used me for bait -- staked me out like a... buildin' up the fire... fixin' it so's... i coulda had my brains blowed out!
speaker2: suppose you'd missed!
speaker1: never occurred to me...

speaker1: howdy, mister jorgensen... 
speaker2: charlie...
speaker1: got a letter here...
speaker2: by golly! a letter?
speaker1: for miss laurie...
speaker3: come in, charlie, come in... laurie!... my land!... two letters in the one year!...

speaker1: a letter for you, laurie... 
speaker2: yes'm... figgered it might be the news you been waitin' for... so...
speaker1: real good o' you to ride all the way over, charlie... might at least say your thank you's, laurie... declare!
speaker2: no need to...
speaker1: well?
speaker3: yah?
speaker1: laurie! don't keep a body just standin'!
speaker4: i was just readin' to see if... anyway, it's my letter!
speaker1: 'course it is. now let's all get comfortable an' set so's we can listen while laurie reads her letter...
speaker2: maybe i'd better be goin'...
speaker3: you stay, charlie... after all, charlie brought the letter, laurie... he got a right to listen too!
speaker4: oh, all right! well... martin says...
speaker3: from the beginning...
speaker4: 'dear miss laury'... he spells it with a y instead of an i... e... wouldn't you think he'd know...
speaker3: who cares what he spells it? read the letter.
speaker4: dear miss laury... i take pen in hand to let you know ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them comanches the late mister futterman told us about...
speaker4: the late mister futterman?
speaker3: that means mister futterman is dead, by golly.
speaker1: wonder what happened to the poor man. go on, laurie.
speaker4: we cut north through indian territory and...

speaker1: she looks at them - dazed. 
speaker2: he did?
speaker3: good! a young man should get married early in life. right, mama?
speaker3: every young man should at least once...go on, laurie! read!
speaker4: laurie!
speaker3: is no way to treat a letter, laurie ...mama maybe you better read it... my wife was a school teacher, charlie ...she reads good.
speaker5: i'll read it...
speaker2: so he married a comanche squaw... haw haw haw!

speaker1: let's go... i think i stumbled onto somethin'... 
speaker2: scar?
speaker1: when are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! come on. let's get out of here.
speaker2: but i just bought a good blanket.
speaker1: forget it...

speaker1: what i heard back there was that a band o' hostile nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago... 
speaker2: think it might be...?
speaker1: what's she followin' for?
speaker2: look, i changed my mind... you can keep your blanket.
speaker2: go on back...
speaker2: look... you don't understand... i don't want it.
speaker1: you don't understand, ya chunkhead! you didn't buy any blanket! ya bought her!
speaker2: what?
speaker1: you got yourself a wife, sonny!
speaker2: oh no! tell her she's got to go back...
speaker1: and have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?... no sir! come on, mrs. pauley...
speaker2: mrs... pauley?
speaker1: i got another gal purtier'n you. i got another gal purtier'n you. i got another gal purtier'n you. skip to my lou, my darlin'.

speaker1: water!... pah! 
speaker2: that's the way to train 'em. looks like mrs. pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
speaker1: cut it out, will ya...
speaker1: look... i wish i could explain to you.
speaker3: look?...
speaker3: nay tzare t'sala-ta-komal-ta-name... unt kang-yah look. .
speaker2: says her name's wild goose flying in the night sky... but she'll answer to look since it pleases ya...
speaker1: look?
speaker2: unt osupanet cah-nay scar? she stares sullenly, not answering.
speaker2: you ask her!
speaker1: look! scar?... do you know where he went? and if he has a girl with him... a white girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
speaker3: mah nee-koo-ur?
speaker1: no... not my wife... my... how do you say sister?
speaker2: nami.

speaker1: beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing... 
speaker2: she ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain... not if she took off where the arrow points.
speaker1: think she means for us to follow?
speaker2: how should i know... she's your wife!
speaker1: i think maybe we oughta...

speaker1: ethan, quit it! 
speaker2: nine... ten!
speaker1: what's the sense in it!

speaker1: least, they won't feed any comanches this winter... killin' buffalo's as good as killin' injuns in this country. 
speaker2: peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
speaker1: ain't that too bad... if you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, i'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...

speaker1: listen!... hear it?... there! ain't that a bugle... and firing? 
speaker2: just hope we ain't too late...

speaker1: well, you're a widower now... 
speaker2: what'd the soldiers have to kill her for!...
speaker2: ethan!
speaker2: look! it's hers, debbie's...
speaker3: so we knew debbie had been in the village... what look was doing there -- whether she'd come to warn them, or maybe to find debbie for me... there's no way of knowing...

speaker1: we gotta catch up with them yellow legs... maybe they got her with them. 
speaker2: and maybe they got scar!

speaker1: yes? 
speaker2: we're looking for a girl -- a white girl...
speaker3: she'd be about thirteen now...
speaker1: we got two around that age...
speaker3: where?
speaker1: you'll have to wait until we reach the agency... fall in behind the column...
speaker3: but couldn't you...?
speaker1: sorry...

speaker1: and it was clear to me the hostiles outnumbered us four to one... with all the advantage of terrain... 
speaker2: four to one! what did you do, general? ethan and martin enter, stand in the doorway.
speaker1: sir -- we charged!... gentlemen -- and i hope you will quote me -- i cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp...
speaker3: cheyenne! what cheyenne?
speaker1: i beg your pardon?
speaker3: that camp you hit was nawyecka comanche... chief scar's bunch...
speaker2: scar? what a wonderful name!...
speaker1: are you getting this, keefer?
speaker2: how do you spell that word -- nawyecka?
speaker3: my name's edwards... i'm looking for my niece... she was in that camp when you attacked...
speaker1: well... i know there were some captives recovered...
speaker4: four of 'em dead... so we were told...
speaker1: unfortunately, the hostiles murdered them as we developed the village...
speaker3: are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a cheyenne and a comanche?
speaker1: keefer!... put this man under arrest!
speaker3: that'll be the day... 'as we developed the village'... next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... you won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
speaker5: shall i show him the captives, sir?
speaker1: just get him out of here!
speaker5: yes sir... this way...

speaker1: debbie?... debbie? 
speaker1: don't be scared, ma'am...
speaker2: just don't pay any attention to her...
speaker1: debbie?
speaker3: pabo-taibo! the other girl has risen almost in the same instant -- but more out of fear. she is younger, but painted like the other. she moves to stand behind the savage one.
speaker1: no... she's not...
speaker4: i ain't sure... where's that doll?
speaker2: was your niece about their age?
speaker4: not far from it...
speaker2: hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
speaker4: they're not white any more -- they're comanche!... let's see the bodies...
speaker4: i don't need you...
speaker2: i'd like you to see them all... it might help us identify them... shot in the head -- flash-burn range... the boy got his skull cracked... here's the girl...
speaker4: no...
speaker4: well, we only got the one lead -- scar... and where we begin to look, i don't know...
speaker2: there's one thing. we recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff... trade goods... couldn't help noticing that most of it was mexican... maybe if you could talk to some of those mexican traders along the border... what do they call themselves?
speaker4: comancheros...
speaker2: that's the breed... course it might take time.
speaker4: time's running out... but i'm obliged to you.

speaker1: ...so we're setting out for new mexico territory in the morning... i am sorry i won't be back for christmas again this year... 
speaker2: and you knittin' that muffler...
speaker1: what's the difference!
speaker2: well, i just thought it would be a sin and a shame not to let someone get some good of it...
speaker1: there's a word crossed out... it looks like 'i wish' or 'i will'... anyway... 'i set pen aside in the hope you are enjoying good health and your folks the same... i remain, respectfully... yours truly, martin paulie.' that's all there is. not a cross on it. laurie just looks at it. jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick in his back. he ceremoniously removes the spectacles and replaces them on the mantel.
speaker3: they never find that girl.
speaker1: yours truly... and he even has to write his full name... martin pauley... not even just martie!... i don't care if he never comes back!
speaker2: now, laurie!...
speaker2: charlie, you'll stay for supper?... now i won't take no for an answer.
speaker4: thought of saying 'no' never crossed my mind, miz jorgensen... no place i'd rather be than right here, right now.
speaker4: one old boot and a button shoe one old boot and a button shoe...

speaker1: recognize it? 
speaker1: there couldn't be two like that in all the world...

speaker1: ay-eh...? 
speaker2: leggo my arm... you look mangier 'n ever.
speaker1: ain't been too good... no sir, not too good... gettin' old, ethan...
speaker2: you were born old...
speaker3: bienvenidos, senores... pulque?... tequila?... mescal?... huiskey?
speaker2: tequila...
speaker4: lo mismo.

speaker1: i been helpin' ye, ethan... i been lookin' all the time... 
speaker2: thanks for nothin'...
speaker3: well, the reward still stands...
speaker1: don't want no money, ethan... jus' a place -- a roof over m' head... a little grub... a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
speaker3: you help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
speaker1: swear it, ethan?... given word?
speaker3: told ya, didn't i?
speaker3: who? where is he... this man?
speaker4: i am this man, senor... emilio gabriel fernandez y figueroa... at your service... ...for a price... ...always for a price...
speaker4: un otra!

speaker1: come on, don juan... we're on our way... 
speaker2: lemme alone...
speaker1: you breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
speaker2: take yer hands off'n me... this lady an' me got some things to talk over!
speaker1: suit yourself... while you're enjoyin' your little conversation, i'll be ridin' out with senor fernandez here... the comanch' medicine country ain't far... there's one camp with a chief named cicatriz.
speaker2: never heard of him...
speaker1: cicatriz is mex for scar... an' he has a white girl in his tepee... be seein' you...
speaker3: buena suerte, estrella... hasta la vista.
speaker4: tu quieres...?
speaker5: 'mind ethan 'bout my rockin' chair!

speaker1: medicine country, huh? 
speaker2: medicine so strong they believe the feather of an eagle found here can guard a man against bullets...
speaker3: if you got one handy, now's the time...

speaker1: your name - big shoulders... his name - he who follows. 
speaker2: you speak pretty good american for a comanche... someone teach you?
speaker1: ah-we pabbo-tie-bo ee-kee-tay?
speaker3: pabbo-tie-bo kim te-moo-er.
speaker2: that's right... we come to trade... only not out here... i don't stand talkin' in the wind.
speaker3: miguel... caballo -- aca!
speaker3: co-bay tabitz-chat.
speaker2: stay out here.
speaker4: not likely.

speaker1: are those his wives too? 
speaker2: two sons -- killed by white men... for each son, i take many scalps... mayah-kay zee-eh!...

speaker1: i've seen scalps before... 
speaker2: this before?
speaker1: i came to trade, not to admire his collection... tell him we're going to pitch camp across the crick... maybe we can talk trade tomorrow. scar hasn't understood all of it. he scowls and looks at emilio.
speaker2: ee-sap! pabbo-tie-bo ee-sap!
speaker2: puetze!

speaker1: walk with dignity! if you gringo heretics have any prayers, say them... 
speaker2: she's alive... can you believe it, she's alive... alive... an' we found her...
speaker1: please!... i, too, am alive... i wish to stay that way. they reach the waiting cargadores and the pack train, surrounded by suspicious comanches.
speaker1: vamanos!

speaker1: you understand, senores... it is not that i am cobarde... cowardly... 
speaker2: don't apologize... you did your job...
speaker1: he knows you -- who you are -- and why you are here... this i did not understand... or i would not... even for gold, senores... have led you here.
speaker1: take it. i do not want blood money. vaya con dios!

speaker1: you figger scar means to kill us? 
speaker2: he's got to... all these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him... now we caught up... it's him or us.
speaker1: why didn't he make his move back there?
speaker2: i don't know... somethin' tied his hands... maybe hospitality...

speaker1: unnt-meah! both men move closer. she takes a frightened step back, as if to run. 
speaker2: debbie... don't you remember me? i'm martin.
speaker1: unnt-meah!
speaker2: we ain't goin'! we ain't goin' without you, debbie... ethan, get the horses... i'll try to keep her talkin'...
speaker3: how? she's even forgot her own language!
speaker2: debbie, you're comin' with us! hear me?
speaker1: no... not now... not ever.
speaker2: i don't care what they've done to you... what happened...
speaker1: they have done... nothing... they are my people...
speaker3: your people? they murdered your family!
speaker1: ee-sap! white men killed them - to steal cows! i was... little... i ran away... they find me... take care of me.
speaker2: no debbie! that ain't what happened! they been lyin' to you...
speaker1: you lie! all white men lie... and kill...
speaker2: debbie, think back! i'm martin... remember? remember how i used to let you ride my horse? tell you stories? don't you remember me, debbie?
speaker1: i remember... from always... at first i prayed to you... come and get me... take me home... you didn't come...

speaker3: stand aside, boy...
speaker2: ethan -- no!

speaker1: debbie! wait! 
speaker2: never mind her! move!

speaker2: over there!

speaker1: they'll be back... 
speaker2: we won't be here... come on!

speaker1: martha... martha! 
speaker2: i gotta open that leg and let the poison out...
speaker1: wait...
speaker1: just in case... read it.
speaker2: 'i, ethan edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to martin pauley...' i don't want your property.... 'sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' debbie's your blood kin...
speaker1: not no more.
speaker2: you can keep your will! i ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself... what kind o' man are you, anyway.
speaker1: she's been with the bucks! she's nothin' now but a...
speaker2: shut your dirty mouth!
speaker2: i hope you die!

speaker1: here he is, lars... combed, curried 'n washed behind the ears! 
speaker2: why, charlie, you look real handsome!
speaker2: you'll see her soon enough...
speaker1: say, that music sounds so good it must be sinful...
speaker2: grab a partner, reverend!
speaker1: well, now, a man of my age just can't haul off and dance in cold blood... but if there's any of that wild cherry brandy of yours, lars...
speaker3: nooo... yah, by golly... one jug left... i get it!
speaker2: last winter that man swore up and down there wasn't a drop left -- and me with pneumoney!... reverend, you'd better start clergyin' again!

speaker3: i gotta see laurie!
speaker1: go around the side... the grandmother's room... i'll tell her...

speaker1: you better! 
speaker2: quick... hide in the barn, ethan...
speaker3: hide? why would i?

speaker1: evenin'... evenin' reverend... or do i call you 'captain'...? 
speaker2: came here for a wedding, ethan... until that's over, i reckon 'reverend' will do...
speaker3: and news of our little girl, ethan?
speaker1: she's not a little girl any more.
speaker3: you've seen her!... she's alive?
speaker1: i've seen her... and she's alive.

speaker1: hello, martie.... 
speaker2: i... i wrote you a letter... reckon you didn't get it...
speaker1: one letter in five years... i read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
speaker2: it wasn't much of a letter...
speaker1: no, it wasn't... you mighta said you loved me... you mighta asked me to wait... at least that'd have been something...
speaker2: but i allus loved you... you know that, without my sayin' it... i couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait... the little i had... not knowin' how much longer until we found debbie...
speaker1: it isn't fair...
speaker2: don't cry, laurie... i understand how it is... i'll just go 'way...
speaker1: you do and i'll die, martie... i will! i'll just die!
speaker3: i'll thank you to leave the room, laurie.
speaker2: charlie maccorry!... you weren't fixin' to marry him??
speaker3: she sure is!... an' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
speaker2: as to that, i don't know, charlie... we hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
speaker3: what right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
speaker2: if you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
speaker3: and other things... mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that indian wife you took... i bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
speaker1: stop it! both of you... i won't have any fighting in this house.
speaker2: it's all right... charlie, let's move outside.
speaker3: i ain't wearing no gun.

speaker1: sergeant maccorry! 
speaker1: is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
speaker2: no sir... pleasure.
speaker1: in that case, give the boys room...
speaker1: fight fair, son... use your fists!
speaker3: could scalp him... but i'll just count coup!
speaker1: you all right, sergeant?
speaker2: dunno... seems so.
speaker1: well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
speaker2: ain't goin' to be any weddin' -- not till we get a few things cleared up 'round here...

speaker1: well... it was a nice weddin' party... considerin' no one got married... 'night. 
speaker2: good night, ed...
speaker2: now, mamma!...
speaker3: i got to ask you and martin to ride to the state capitol with me, ethan.
speaker4: this an invite to a necktie party, reverend?
speaker3: captain... nope, wouldn't say that... likely you had your reasons for killin' futterman... probably needed killin'... i'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend... fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
speaker4: that so?
speaker5: i ain't goin' to austin, reverend.
speaker6: you're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
speaker3: now, now... let's not grow disputatious...
speaker3: what's that? more company?
speaker3: kinda late getting here, aren't they?
speaker7: hello there! captain clayton?

speaker1: is captain clayton here, reverend? 
speaker2: i'm clayton.
speaker1: you're captain clayton?...
speaker1: colonel greenhill's compliments, sir.
speaker2: hold on, son... who's this colonel greenhill you're talking about?
speaker1: why colonel greenhill is colonel greenhill, sir... commanding officer, fifth u.s. cavalry... i'm lieutenant greenhill, sir.
speaker2: oh... now what's this your pa wants to know?
speaker1: my pa wants to know... colonel greenhill wants to know how soon you could put a company of your rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the comanches.
speaker2: joint action?
speaker1: yes sir... we've received information about a band of comanches under a chief named scar...
speaker3: what information?
speaker1: that maybe he's not far from here -- holed up somewhere, waiting his chance to get back over the border... he raided north about a month ago... ran into more army than he bargained for... now he's running for cover, for keeps this time...
speaker2: and what makes you think he's in this territory?
speaker1: yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago... he talks crazy but i brought him along... says he lives here... keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
speaker3: mose...

speaker1: ay-he?... ay-eh?... 
speaker2: come f'r my rockin' chai'... ole mose.
speaker3: where's scar, mose... scar?
speaker4: ask him about debbie!... is she all right, mose?
speaker2: my rockin' chai'...
speaker3: mose... try to remember!... you were in scar's camp...
speaker2: ay-he... made out i was crazy... ate dirt... chewed grass... i fooled 'em, ethan!... an' i got away...
speaker3: scar! where's he holed in?
speaker2: seven fingers... ay-he... seven...
speaker5: now that's enough! here... by the fire... what you need's a good bowl of soup...
speaker3: seven fingers?
speaker6: that's what he told us... but there's no such place on the maps.
speaker4: wait a minute! isn't that the caddo name for where all those canyons branch on the malapai?
speaker2: caddo or kiowa... ay-he... ay-eh...
speaker7: you tell your pa a company of rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight... headin' for the south end of the malapai. if he can catch up with us, well an' good...
speaker6: but... but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow... for your own protection...
speaker7: sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with texican scalps an' white girl captive... you want to protect us, you just get out of our way... now skedaddle!
speaker7: ethan, you an' martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay... charlie, hightail it to headquarters an' spread the word...
speaker8: yes sir...
speaker4: my guns...

speaker1: martie... don't go! not this time. 
speaker2: you crazy?
speaker1: it's too late... she's a woman grown now...
speaker2: i got to fetch her home...
speaker1: fetch what home?... the leavin's of comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?... with savage brats of her own, most like?...
speaker2: laurie! shut your mouth!
speaker1: do you know what ethan will do if he has a chance?... he'll put a bullet in her brain! and i tell you martha would want him to!
speaker2: only if i'm dead!

speaker1: you ready? 
speaker2: i'm ready.

speaker1: we can get within 500 yards... there's a hogback to the south. 
speaker2: how many, would you say?
speaker1: enough to go around... i'd say about a dozen apiece... mount 'em up!
speaker3: wait! we go chargin' in, they'll kill her... and you know it.
speaker1: it's what i'm countin' on.
speaker3: i know you are... only it ain't goin' to be that way... she's alive...
speaker1: livin' with comanches ain't bein' alive...
speaker3: she's alive... better she's alive and livin' with comanches than her brains bashed out...
speaker2: now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
speaker1: there sure is! i'm going to tell you somethin'... i wasn't going to speak of it... but i'll tell you now. did you notice them scalps strung on scar's lance?
speaker1: did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? long... wavy hair...
speaker3: i saw it... and don't try to tell me it was aunt martha's or lucy's...
speaker1: you don't remember it, but i remember. that was your mother's scalp!
speaker1: i didn't want to tell you... but maybe it's your right to know.
speaker2: now mount up, son...
speaker3: it don't change it... all i'm askin' is a chance to sneak in there... an' try to get her out before you come chargin' in.
speaker2: what if you're caught?
speaker3: it won't tell 'em anything, will it! just a man alone...
speaker1: i say no!
speaker2: go ahead, son... but at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
speaker1: it's your funeral...
speaker4: here... you fight like a comanch... maybe this'll help ya pass as one.

speaker1: what in...? 
speaker2: captain clayton... captain!
speaker1: go on! whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
speaker2: sir?
speaker1: never mind... your pa know you're out here?
speaker2: yes, sir... troop's about ten miles back... the colonel sent me looking for you...
speaker1: well you found me... good work, son... good work.
speaker2: if there's anything i can do, sir...
speaker1: forbid... no, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at... and where he's at...
speaker2: but he knows that, sir... can't i stay, sir?
speaker1: all right... but keep your eye on me, boy... i'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages... if you don't hear me first time i holler, you better read my mind... i don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
speaker2: yes, sir...
speaker1: watch that knife, boy!

speaker1: debbie... don't! 
speaker1: i'm takin' you whether you want to or not...

speaker1: clayton, if you were in my command i'd have you courtmartialed for this! 
speaker2: hurry it up!
speaker1: what's the matter, sir... you wounded? what is it, sergeant -- a bullet or an arrow?
