speaker1: no one can deny the horrendous nature of mr. frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years he has been with us, i have never seen a patient turn his energies to more productive use. casanova, the picture of remorse and repentance. 
speaker1: just look at his accomplishments... three volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture garden, four romance novels... and who can forget his touching portrayal of billy bigelow in our all-psychotic production of "carousel"...
speaker1: directed by our own doctor anabel leek.
speaker2: twenty years ago i was a lost soul. loveless... fatherless... a... psycho! oh! how could i have done it? the murder... the mayhem... all of those lovely young girls! i'm sorry! i'm so so sorry!

speaker1: boom. 
speaker1: those gas leaks can be murder.

speaker1: golf anyone? 
speaker2: not a bad night's work.
speaker3: who said crime don't pay?
speaker4: hey, boss, we got a stowaway.
speaker5: who you laughin' at, punk?
speaker2: he's just a tyke. lighten up.
speaker6: he's kinda cute.
speaker4: if you like drool.
speaker2: hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents? for a million bucks!
speaker3: and what if he rats on us?
speaker4: so what should we do with him?
speaker3: stick a brick in his pampers and dump him in the lake.
speaker4: come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.

speaker1: not so fast, gentlemen--and i use the term loosely... unhand that youngster... 
speaker2: or you're mulch.
speaker3: what are you guys supposed to be... superheroes?
speaker4: we are superheroes!
speaker3: really? did you mother make those costumes? the crooks howl with laughter.
speaker3: this is our territory. beat it.
speaker4: over your dead body.
speaker3: 0ooooo, he's scary.
speaker3: a fork!
speaker1: and there's plenty more where that came from.

speaker1: crush him, mikey!... mash him!... mush him! 
speaker2: is that all you got?

speaker1: your mother! 
speaker2: is there a problem?

speaker1: we give!... we're sorry!... we had terrible childhoods! 
speaker2: nice work, captain.
speaker3: hi. dawn.
speaker4: looks like you've done it again, captain.
speaker3: it's what i do.
speaker5: okay, show's over. move it. on your way.
speaker2: wait a minute, officers. you don't understand-- we're superheroes, and we just busted up this gang.
speaker5: really? let me guess-you're towel head and he's... captain pooper scooper!
speaker5: hey! move it!
speaker6: get a life!
speaker5: and leave crime fighting to the real thing!
speaker5: wannabes.
speaker6: pathetic.

speaker1: he's lance hunt! just take off the glasses-- and it's him! 
speaker2: there's a vague similarity.
speaker1: a vague similarity? it's the same guy!
speaker2: we take the licks and he gets the chicks.
speaker3: how long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
speaker1: we need a break, that's all! nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein!
speaker2: but look at him... and look at us.
speaker3: the camera loves him.
speaker2: i lost another fork tonight. she's getting suspicious, i know it.
speaker1: so why don't you just tell her!
speaker2: i can't.
speaker1: why not?
speaker2: because i can't! okay? she wouldn't understand!
speaker3: leave him alone. she's his mother, not yours.
speaker1: we had an off night, that's all.
speaker3: so when are we gonna have an on night?
speaker4: hi.
speaker2: you're... new.
speaker4: it's my first night. my name's monica.
speaker5: you guys going to a costume party?
speaker2: we're superheroes.
speaker5: really? like captain amazing?
speaker5: are you famous?
speaker2: not yet.
speaker5: so you're like... struggling superheroes?
speaker2: we prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... i am the blue raja, master of silverware...
speaker5: wow.
speaker2: and these are my associatiates, the shoveler.

speaker1: hi. 
speaker2: and mister furious... his anger is his power.
speaker3: really?
speaker2: usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. in his case, it's entirely emotional.
speaker3: so what can i get you?
speaker2: she likes you.
speaker1: definitely.
speaker2: ask her out.
speaker4: nah.
speaker2: roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
speaker2: so you're chicken?
speaker4: who's chicken?
speaker4: doesn't it you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
speaker3: i guess... are you always so angry?
speaker4: only when i'm awake... you busy after work? she shrugs.
speaker4: want to go out and get drunk?
speaker4: or talk?
speaker3: not tonight.
speaker2: maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
speaker4: like what? cutting off my own ear?
speaker2: or flowers.
speaker4: see ya tomorrow.

speaker1: hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place up? 
speaker2: when you're on tv.
speaker3: right--like that will ever happen.
speaker4: save any babies lately?
speaker2: faster than a speeding turtle--
speaker5: more powerful than a deodorant--
speaker3: able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting--
speaker4: look, snoring in his chair--
speaker3: sitting on the john--
speaker6: it's... supergut!

speaker1: jeffrey! 
speaker2: oh hi, mom.
speaker1: what are you doing in the silver drawer?
speaker2: looking for... the tv guide.
speaker1: it's on the television.
speaker2: of course. i'm such a fool... thanks, mummy. go to bed.

speaker1: i hope you enjoy these cigars. i had to kill a dozen cubans to get them. 
speaker2: ummm.
speaker1: have you considered my offer?
speaker2: you know, mr. f, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. you had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. you were the king... casanova accepts this graciously.
speaker2: but times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. i can see you still got the style, but i dunno for sure you still got the edge.
speaker1: i got it.
speaker2: what about captain amazing?
speaker3: good question.
speaker1: i knew you'd cone. i left that skylight open for you.
speaker3: i know you did.
speaker1: i knew you'd know.
speaker3: i know you knew i'd know.
speaker1: but did you know i knew you'd know i'd know?
speaker3: of course.
speaker3: i'd hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of scum like you, tony. tony freezes.
speaker3: the jig is up, casanova. i've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
speaker1: really?
speaker3: i know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
speaker3: i know who your girlfriend really is...
speaker3: and i know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
speaker1: i guess you know just about everything, don't you, lance?
speaker3: um-hmm.
speaker1: except for one little thing.
speaker3: and what's that?
speaker1: that i've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
speaker3: what--?

speaker1: how many times i gotta tell you about this? 
speaker2: sally, that's a herkimer battle jitney! they don't make 'em like that anymore. it's a classic!
speaker1: it's a hunk of junk. i want the iron. do it!

speaker1: but we don't know for sure it's the same guy. furious groans. 
speaker2: hey, look.

speaker1: well, don, i've done some terrible things in my life, but now i'm cured, and i just want to give back something to my old home town... that's why i'm using what's left of my fortune to build... 
speaker1: the frankenstein center for the arts.
speaker2: you've changed, haven't you?
speaker1: oh yes.
speaker3: no he hasn't.

speaker1: let's go. 
speaker2: wait!... look!

speaker1: this is bad. 
speaker2: who are they?
speaker1: the disco boys.
speaker3: the who?
speaker1: the most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. twenty years ago they were casanova's personal bodyguard. but after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
speaker3: well they've crawled back out.
speaker2: we may be getting in over our heads here.
speaker1: this looks like a job for superman--
speaker2: or batman--
speaker1: or both.
speaker3: don't you guys get it? if captain amazing is still in there, we can rescue him--and get on

speaker1: everything's going exactly as we planned. 
speaker2: not quite. you haven't announced our engagement yet.
speaker1: it must have slipped my mind.
speaker2: your mind is so slippery.
speaker1: don't worry, pootchkie. my womanizing days are over. you're my lady macbeth, my imelda... my nicole. we're such an incredible team. who could possibly stop us?

speaker1: don't crunch the leaves. 
speaker2: sorry.
speaker1: be a mohican.
speaker3: wait. i hear something.
speaker1: i'm soaked. oh great.
speaker3: shhh.
speaker2: be a mohican.
speaker1: shut up.
speaker3: come on.
speaker1: uh-oh.
speaker1: oh i'm sorry. we must have the wrong house.
speaker4: you sure do.
speaker5: hi there.
speaker5: superheroes.
speaker4: should i kill them?
speaker5: why bother?

speaker1: here you go. 
speaker2: ow.
speaker1: maybe you guys ought to forget this superhero stuff and join kiwanis or something. a fussy customer is calling out from another table.
speaker3: miss!
speaker2: maybe she's right.
speaker4: what are you talking about?
speaker5: what have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
speaker2: agents?
speaker5: archenemies! casanova isn't just a criminal-- he's a supervillain. stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune--and babes!
speaker4: and it would be the right thing to do.
speaker5: yeah yeah--and that, too.
speaker2: but there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
speaker5: then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood...
speaker5: furious
speaker4: i'm liking this.
speaker5: i say we send out the word--and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
speaker2: yeah, but... who do we know?
speaker5: well... there's the spleen.
speaker2: do we have to?
speaker4: i got this cousin. he's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
speaker5: have you ever seen him?
speaker4: how could i see him if he's invisible?
speaker5: good point.
speaker2: and there's the sphinx.
speaker4: the who?
speaker2: he's a legendary masked mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
speaker5: sounds good.
speaker2: no one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the tacky taco down by the bus station.
speaker4: get outta here.

speaker1: you sure that's how you spell it? 
speaker2: yeah.

speaker1: so, let me get this straight. you have the power to become invisible. 
speaker2: yes.
speaker3: but... only when no one is looking.
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: if someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
speaker2: yes.
speaker3: so you're only invisible... to yourself?
speaker2: no.
speaker4: no?
speaker2: if i look at myseif, i become visible.
speaker3: so you're only invisible, when abuolutely no one is looking at you?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: so how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
speaker2: i just know.
speaker1: look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview--

speaker1: boy i can't tell you how thrilled i was when you guys called--you gonna eat that pickle? i've always dreamed of being a member of the a real superhero team--and to have friends--real friends--i mean guys i could live with--sleep with--die with--eat with... 
speaker1: i love mustard.
speaker2: so what exactly is your superpower?
speaker1: well, when i was a kid i grew up on love canal- -remember that?--and my brothers and i used to go swimming in it--make kool-aid out of it-- stuff like that. anyway my brothers all died, but i lived, and i grew all these like weird organs that have never been seen in humans before. so now i can do things like this!
speaker1: cool, huh?
speaker3: watch it!... look out!... whoa!
speaker1: sorry, sorry.
speaker4: hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?
speaker1: i tried that once. the cork melted.

speaker1: there's just not enough of us. 
speaker2: but we know they're out there. hundreds--maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
speaker3: and a social life.
speaker1: yeah, but how do we get to them?
speaker4: obscene phone calls?
speaker5: why don't you throw a barbecue? on our heroes, realizing that's it.

speaker1: come on in! the water's great! 
speaker2: great picnic, dad.
speaker3: big turnout.
speaker4: are these guys real superheroes?
speaker5: they think so.
speaker4: but where's captain amazing?
speaker3: he wouldn't be caught dead here.
speaker1: hey, these pool mints are delicious!
speaker6: maybe there was traffic.
speaker7: who are we kidding? no one's gonna show. we're living in a fantasy!
speaker8: come on, guys--we're fighting against evil.
speaker7: good or evil, what's the difference?
speaker9: there's a big difference.
speaker7: i used to believe that. now i'm not so sure.
speaker6: roy, remember, it is all within your power. the only thing that's in your way... is you.
speaker7: oh shut up.
speaker8: they're here!
speaker10: hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?
speaker6: this is it. come on in!
speaker11: all right! party!
speaker6: i am the blue raja, master of silverware.
speaker10: i am squeegee man, and these are my compadres, the invincible dudes! the invincible dudes spot the keg.
speaker12: whoa! brews! party!
speaker6: would you mind filling out these forms; names, addresses, description of superpowers, that sort of thing.
speaker12: sure, dude. no problem.
speaker13: hey, man, like where are the babes?
speaker14: it said on the card there'd be babes!
speaker6: actually we lied about the babes, but there's plenty of burgers.
speaker12: that's false advertising!... we came all the way from south champion, man! we coulda gone plinking!... we coulda gone bunqee jumping!
speaker15: no babes. no peace. invisible dudes no babes--no peace! no babes--no peace! no babes--no peace!
speaker15: let's trash the place!
speaker12: yeah!
speaker7: if you're a superhero, what's your power?
speaker15: i am squeegee man. touch my squeegee... and you die.
speaker7: can you fly?
speaker15: no.
speaker7: wanna bet?

speaker1: who died? 
speaker2: who are you?
speaker1: i'm the bowler.
speaker3: the bowler? i remember him from when i was a kid. he was killed years ago.
speaker1: i'm his daughter.
speaker3: look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
speaker1: really?

speaker1: good ball. 
speaker1: if it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be impressed, right?
speaker2: hey... can i buy you a beer?
speaker1: i thought you'd never ask.

speaker1: he was more than just a superhero... he was my father... 
speaker1: and then one day, he didn't come home. the police said it was an accident. but cargo
speaker2: so who killed him?

speaker1: the disco boys. 
speaker2: you know something? those guys are really starting to me off!
speaker3: but there's still only six of us.

speaker1: that's two more than the fantastic four. 
speaker2: half a dirty dozen!
speaker3: twice the three stooges!
speaker4: and only one short of the magnificent seven.
speaker5: and you can't count horst buckholtz anyway.
speaker1: he was cute though.
speaker5: but they all had one thing we haven't got.
speaker3: girlfriends?
speaker5: a name. all the great superhero teams have got a fabulous name.
speaker1: how about... the savage six?
speaker5: the inscrutable six?
speaker3: the six pistols?
speaker6: the exterminators!
speaker4: the obliterators!
speaker5: the eradicators!
speaker1: the emasculators!
speaker3: wait--i got it!... the spleen team.
speaker2: to with a name. let's get to work.

speaker1: not these guys again! 
speaker2: nice car.
speaker3: what did you do with captain amazing?
speaker2: captain who?
speaker4: i'm his daughter.
speaker1: his daughter? well guess what, sweetheart? i'm the one who squished your daddy. and he squished real good!

speaker1: waste him! 
speaker2: shall i check your oil?
speaker2: looks fine.

speaker1: that boy's got talent. 
speaker2: and i'm gonna nip it in the bud.

speaker1: to us! 
speaker2: whatever our name is.

speaker1: even his snores smell bad. 
speaker2: but she's your mother. you gotta tell her.
speaker3: i can't.

speaker1: dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid waste of time. 
speaker2: but he plays golf, right?
speaker1: yeah.

speaker1: i'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. medicine. law. 
speaker2: but you're a superhero.
speaker1: the cape. the turban. she wouldn't understand.
speaker2: i know... my girlfriends all dumped me after i put on the mask. they thought i'd lost it.
speaker1: but in fact... you'd found it.

speaker1: this is your dream... and you can't ever give it up. the spleen makes weird noises in his sleep. 
speaker2: i wonder what he dreams about?
speaker1: we don't want to know.
speaker3: a black van drives slowly past the bar.

speaker1: it's late. i'm headin' home. 
speaker2: me, too.
speaker1: come on, junior, it's a school night.
speaker3: as our heroes, carrying the spleen, leave.
speaker4: anybody up for a little white castle?

speaker1: hi, cutie. 
speaker1: six losers. six bullets. perfect... got any last words, angry boy?
speaker2: disco
speaker1: disco very good. you know what i'm gonna do, angry boy, since you're so colorful? i'm gonna save you for last.
speaker1: sweet dreams, punk.

speaker1: buenos naches. 
speaker2: get him!
speaker1: would you like me to trim the sides?
speaker2: what?
speaker3: you're the sphinx.
speaker4: and you are a fool.

speaker1: you call yourselves superheroes? a rooster fights more intelligently than you! you have shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your powers to him--and what have you accouplished for this? you have destroyed his car. brilliant! if you want to survive you must fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack! furious sulks, but the others get the point. 
speaker1: the wolf is cunning. he knows that stealth is his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a team... sphinx not like some drunken tejano on saturday night. furious grunts.
speaker1: casanova frankenstein is a a master of evil. you will need more than shovels and dessert forks to stop him... what else have you got? they are silent.
speaker2: so what else has superman got?
speaker3: he's got the fact that he's superman!
speaker4: bullets bounce off him!
speaker5: firepower costs money.
speaker6: anybody got any?
speaker3: we didn't think this through very well.

speaker1: are you sure he's still lives here? 
speaker2: are you sure he's still alive?
speaker3: he was the last time i saw him.
speaker1: when was that?

speaker1: i was eight. 
speaker2: yes!
speaker1: doctor heller?
speaker2: yes!
speaker1: it's me... elizabeth.
speaker2: elizabeth! little elizabeth! why you're so... middle aged!
speaker1: thanks.
speaker2: how's your dad?
speaker1: he's dead.
speaker2: oh that's right--they squished him... heck of a guy.
speaker1: doc, these are my friends. we're superheroes, and we need your help.
speaker2: well, i give to the united way, and i feel that sort of covers--
speaker3: doctor, we need your weapons.
speaker2: my weapons? you need my weapons?

speaker1: but, doc... where's the machine guns? 
speaker2: the bazookas?
speaker3: the lasers?
speaker4: you don't need that junk! you see, for thousands of years mankind has been immolating, disemboweling, and exploding itself. why? because we have this built-in screwed up need to go to war! heller so as a young man i thought, why nat have the fun and excitement of war, without all that unnecessary bloodshed. that's why i have devoted my life to developing an arsenal of highly sophisticated non-lethal military weapons. air cannons... blame throwers... feet seeking missiles... and perhaps my ultimate invention... the canned tornado.
speaker4: now here's a beauty! i call it the shrinker! i developed it after years of studying the worst dry cleaners i could find. it instantly shrinks fabrics to half their size. anyone caught in its spray is immediately immobilized by their own clothing!
speaker5: let's get out of here.

speaker1: hey, mister bad mood. 
speaker1: catch.
speaker2: he's got the air cannon!
speaker3: doc, you're a genius!
speaker2: i know.
speaker4: no.
speaker4: we are not yet ready. now we must learn to fight together... as one thing.

speaker1: twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and casanova was their king. 
speaker2: crime was rampant. it wasn't safe to stay in your home.
speaker3: much less go outside.
speaker2: then captain amazing appeared.
speaker1: he busted casanova and sent the crooks packing.
speaker2: and this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
speaker4: the wise snake coils before he strikes.
speaker5: and a skunk stinks!
speaker4: you drink too much.
speaker5: when are you going to take off that mask?
speaker4: when i am sure i am among friends.
speaker1: roy--
speaker5: go dance with your mother, jeffrey!
speaker4: your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
speaker5: my heart died a long time ago.
speaker4: it is not dead. it is hiding.
speaker5: blow it out your bean hole, pancho!... and to with the rest of you!... look at you. bunch of rejects. i didn't need you before-- and i don't need you now! the great ones ride alone! adios, muchachos! on the others, watching him...
speaker3: has he always been like this?

speaker1: oh this place looks great. 
speaker1: now honey, you just wait in the car. mommy and daddy will be right beck.
speaker2: pow! bang! wham!

speaker1: it's nice and cool in here. 
speaker2: barkeep, a couple of cold ones.

speaker1: and here's a banana for your monkey. 
speaker1: couple more?
speaker2: you bet.
speaker3: mommy! daddy! mommy! daddy!

speaker1: hi. 
speaker2: hi.
speaker1: alone tonight?
speaker2: every night.

speaker1: where are they going? 
speaker2: kid!

speaker1: ...still no sign of millionaire lance hunt, and now, in an unrelated story, another one of champion city's leading citizens has apparently disappeared. captain amazing has not been seen or heard from in a week. authorities believe that the hard working superhero may just be taking a well deserved rest. 
speaker2: cancun perhaps?
speaker1: sounds good to me, don.
speaker3: date?
speaker4: yeah.
speaker3: i get off work in fifteen minutes. walk me home?
speaker4: sure.
speaker3: that was easy. on furious, feeling a whole lot better.

speaker1: wait. i'll be right there. 
speaker2: where are you going?
speaker1: head hunting.

speaker1: i admire you. 
speaker2: why?
speaker1: being a superhero, wanting to save the world. it's so... unselfish.
speaker2: it is?
speaker1: most people just want to make money or be famous or something. but you risk everything, just to help people.
speaker2: i wouldn't mind being famous.
speaker1: who wouldn't?
speaker1: i've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why i guess i'm still a waitress.
speaker2: nothing wrong with being a waitress.
speaker1: what's your real name?
speaker2: roy.
speaker1: have you always lived here?
speaker1: me too... i love this stupid old town. it's noisy. it's smelly. it's falling apart.
speaker2: it's home.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker3: monica, smiling, looking lovely.

speaker1: i've thought of leaving, going to chicago or new york, but... 
speaker2: what have they got that we ain't got?
speaker1: champion's going to bounce back, and i want to be here when it does.
speaker2: me, too.
speaker1: you don't seem very angry right now.
speaker1: you know what? underneath all that anger i think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
speaker2: i just want to be a superhero.
speaker1: that's what i mean... 'night, roy.
speaker3: going my way?
speaker3: take it easy--take it easy. i just want to have a little chat... that was quite a number you did on my car. you've got a lot of violence in you... and i like that in a guy. furious, silent.
speaker3: you know what the difference is between good and evil, roy?
speaker3: evil is more fun. when you want something, you just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, you kill them... you seem like a very frustrated guy, roy. unhappy. unfulfilled. what is it that you've always wanted, always desired? because whatever it is, i can give it to you... fame? easy. fortune? even easier. women? the easiest of all.
speaker3: i'll let you in on a little secret, roy. in two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a thing your little pals can do about it. it's the perfect time to switch teams... so what do you say?
speaker2: you're nuts.
speaker3: they always call the great ones nuts.
speaker2: and the nuts always call themselves great.
speaker3: are you with me... or against me?
speaker2: against.
speaker3: too bad. plug him!

speaker1: thanks for reminding me which team i'm on. 
speaker2: you're dead.
speaker1: so are you!

speaker1: freeze! 
speaker2: hands up!
speaker2: what are you two doing here?
speaker1: not talking, eh? that can be fixed. turn around, start walking up the hill--
speaker2: and no funny business.
speaker3: pinch 'em.
speaker4: whatever was in that crate... is from russia.
speaker5: is there room in the pack for one more wolf?
speaker5: i was wrong... i need my friends.
speaker6: amigo. they embrace.
speaker5: casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
speaker7: what did he mean?
speaker5: i dunno.
speaker8: maybe it's time we checked that place out.
speaker9: but how do we get in?
speaker5: we just become like the wolf... who wears the sheep's clothing.

speaker1: so where's the art? 
speaker2: he hasn't stolen it yet.
speaker3: this place is built like a fortress.
speaker2: because thats what it is.
speaker1: what's that?
speaker2: come on.

speaker1: the bone heads from the south side... 
speaker1: the bland boys from downtown...
speaker1: italian ice...
speaker1: the stapler...

speaker1: the elvis brothers. 
speaker2: excuse me.
speaker2: monica... beautiful name. it suits you.
speaker2: i hope you won't take this the wrong way, but i couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for veronica lake in "the blue dahlia".
speaker3: really?
speaker2: are you an actress?
speaker3: just a waitress.
speaker2: you underestimate yourself.
speaker2: you know i'm writing a play--it's just a little broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that i think you'd be perfect for.
speaker3: really?
speaker2: i'd love to hear you read it. could you stick around after the luncheon?
