speaker1: the last of the great cities died when my father was a child. another victim of yet another war. the plagues followed. and the terrors. the living hid themselves away in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained. the earth itself had fallen prey to chaos. for three years a dirty snow fell that even summer could not erase. the ocean was barren. poisoned. near death. 
speaker1: sixteen long years passed before the great lungs started working again. my father said it was as if the ocean breathed a great sigh of relief...

speaker1: i don't know. and if you ask me again, i'm going to slug you. 
speaker1: it's been fun, hasn't it, kids? you're welcome!

speaker1: damnit, bill, you know i need to check it first! 
speaker1: better than turpentine. tastes about the same. your call, bill.
speaker1: you ain't picky, bill. i like that about you.

speaker1: 'running on empty'? tell me about it. 
speaker1: hey, bill! we got tv! 147 channels. everything from to 'jeopardy'.
speaker1: 'like sands through the hour- glass, so are the days of our lives...' 'michael shields, come on down, you're the next contestant on...'the price is right'.' i'll take domestic nuclear disasters for two hundred thousand, alex...
speaker1: we interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the second civil war... well,
speaker1: i don't want any trouble... i bet you don't either... let's just call it a draw, okay?
speaker1: look out, bill!

speaker1: i'm just passing through. i don't mean anyone any harm. water's good. 
speaker1: i'm not a holnist.
speaker1: okay?
speaker1: i'm headed for a town called st.

speaker1: portland's under twenty feet of water. 
speaker2: well, i heard different.
speaker1: you mouthin' me?
speaker2: no, it's just that it's hard to get good information.
speaker3: he is mouthin' you; i say we kill him.
speaker1: don't be in such a rush, martin. now i see a pack mule over there, but i don't see no packs.
speaker2: this is all i got.
speaker1: oh... kill him, martin.
speaker2: okay! my stuff's up there!
speaker4: what do you got in there?
speaker1: shut up. what do you got in there?

speaker1: dried peas. beef jerky. 
speaker2: cigarettes!
speaker1: sure. there's the ladder.
speaker3: maybe he's got it booby-trapped.
speaker4: you go up and get it.

speaker1: it's going to take a second. i got my stuff bolted in. 
speaker2: the lead bandit takes a cautious step back.
speaker3: put some buckshot through it, martin. just to hurry him up.
speaker4: i only got three shells left.
speaker3: so use his gun.

speaker1: bill! 
speaker2: we're rich!

speaker1: they said, 'fear not, macbeth, 'til birnam wood comes to dunsinane'! 
speaker1: i said, birnam wood comes to dunsinane!

speaker1: arm, arm yourselves! if the witch's words are true, there'll be no running or hiding here! 
speaker1: tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that. out brief candle! life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. it's a tale told by a moron. full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. but blow, wind! come wrack! at least we'll die with the harness off our back!
speaker2: the children have never heard shakespeare before.
speaker1: they still haven't.
speaker1: thanks. you're very nice.
speaker3: i'm clapping because you stink.

speaker1: i don't think you understand how it works. 
speaker2: when i was young, i tried to be an actor. i was awful. but now i won't die thinking i was the worst one.
speaker1: i'm glad i could help.
speaker3: larry, stop it. you were very good.
speaker1: good enough to get something to eat?
speaker4: holnists! holnists are coming!
speaker3: it's okay. we give them food and supplies. all the towns do.
speaker5: they hardly kill anyone lately.
speaker1: well, i'd just as soon not give them anything of mine. let's find the back door, bill.

speaker1: what are you doing there? 
speaker1: i said, what are you doing?
speaker2: it's just a game, general bethlehem. something they saw in a play. no harm in it.
speaker1: a play? show me. it's all right, children, show me.
speaker3: arm, arm yourselves! no running from the witches!
speaker1: shakespeare, is it? well, i'm sorry i missed it.

speaker1: you should know, sir, we haven't nearly stocked the game we thought we would. 
speaker2: really? but you had time for a play?
speaker2: i'm taking three conscripts from each town. they will have the honor of serving in the holnist army until such time as i see fit. three men. you suppose you could do that?
speaker3: all men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now.
speaker2: acceptable.
speaker3: sir?
speaker2: acceptable, captain!

speaker1: you'll need to put some meat on, but i like an impressionable mind. acceptable. 
speaker1: mongoloid. unacceptable.
speaker1: i want pure blood. someone like...
speaker1: that man.
speaker2: you don't understand...
speaker3: you were required to show yourself.
speaker2: but, i'm not with these people. i'm just passing through. i --
speaker3: take the mule.

speaker1: hi. 
speaker2: hi?
speaker1: well... i mean, we know each other, kind of...
speaker2: kind of.
speaker1: wow!
speaker2: so what did you guys do with my cigarettes?
speaker1: we traded them for a woman.
speaker2: wonderful. what happened to your partners?
speaker1: they traded me to the holnists.
speaker3: ten hut!

speaker1: welcome, gentlemen, to your new life. you have been born again as soldiers in the army of the united clans of holn. the strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak. men, strong men, have been denied their destiny. you men have been saved from that fate. redemption is within your grasp. 
speaker1: you. what did you do before you were given this opportunity?
speaker2: i had a shovel. i digged holes.
speaker1: you digged holes... well, now you're going to fill them. and you?
speaker3: me?
speaker1: is there any question in anyone's mind that i was talking to you? yes, you. you look like a dangerous man. are you?
speaker3: i'm just a performer.
speaker1: shakespeare?
speaker3: he was a writer. he --
speaker1: i know who shakespeare was... 'cry "havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war.'

speaker1: i, um, you want a line? 
speaker1: 'to be or not to be: that is the question.'
speaker2: 'we few, we happy few, we band of brothers.'
speaker1: 'now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york.' bethlehem claps the postman on the back.
speaker2: you're pretty good. you're also a fighter. i see it in your eyes.
speaker2: don't you agree? come on, a man's got to speak his mind.
speaker1: i don't mean any disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off just letting me go. a fighter is about the last thing i am.

speaker1: don't you think i should be the judge of that, soldier? 
speaker1: get up. i said, get up.
speaker1: put up your fists.
speaker2: you'd win.
speaker1: now fight.
speaker1: you're right. you're not a fighter. but you will be. i'm giving you a chance at a life that means something. a life worth living.

speaker1: thanks. did i win? 
speaker1: i tried to tell him...
speaker2: say it again.
speaker1: say what?
speaker2: the words you said in town. about the wind blowing. and the rest...
speaker1: 'blow, wind. come wrack. at least we'll die with the harness off our back.'
speaker2: what's it mean?
speaker1: live free or die.
speaker3: all right, girls. we're gonna run. twenty miles. with packs. you got three hours. everybody makes it. or nobody eats.

speaker1: eat up! you got meat tonight. 
speaker1: why don't you tell shakespeare what kind of meat that is.
speaker2: mule.
speaker1: a godawful animal. the sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey. can you imagine that?! there's no room in this new world for a like that.
speaker1: uh uh. any man last in line ain't hungry enough. you show up last, you don't eat! bandit 20 steps away in disbelief. not knowing what else to do, he sits down beside the postman, the only man with food who isn't eating.
speaker3: i'll die before i'm last in line again.
speaker4: that's what they're hoping for.
speaker3: serious? this isn't bad.
speaker4: these were supposed to be the best years of my life.

speaker1: the laws of eight, gentlemen. that is the legacy handed down to us by nathan holn. 
speaker2: rest his soul!
speaker3: may he burn in hell. getty looks over at him. he heard him. the postman swallows hard. getty stares hard. then he turns away.
speaker1: these are the laws that we live by. the eight is our symbol. each man will bear it with pride.
speaker1: only then will you be part of the clan. sit down, gentlemen.
speaker1: law one. you will obey orders without question. i told you to sit.
speaker4: there weren't enough chairs.

speaker1: i didn't specify chairs. you could've sat down on the ground. 
speaker1: you disobeyed a direct order. you broke law one.
speaker1: law two. punishment shall be swift.
speaker1: law three: mercy is for the weak. four: terror will defeat reason. five: your allegiance is to the clan. six: justice can be dictated. law seven. any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. does any man here wish to challenge me?
speaker1: on your feet!
speaker1: law eight: there is only one penalty: death.
speaker2: please, i'm begging you.

speaker1: you will get out of this army what you put into it. work and you'll be fed. fight and you'll be respected. die and you'll be remembered. it's up to you. 
speaker2: you thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan?
speaker3: no, sir. i'm a follower not a leader.
speaker2: you see colonel getty? always following the general? he's the only man who ever challenged. fight lasted six seconds, but the general didn't kill him. he cut off his tongue and he cut off his and old getty's been following him like a dog ever since.
speaker2: the general don't see it, but i say you got some in you.

speaker1: they're yours. a solitary man, aren't you? binoculars. to watch life from a distance. and shakespeare. to read about it instead of living it. 
speaker2: no offense, general, but you seem to have read some shakespeare yourself.
speaker1: if he wishes to rise above mere thuggery, a military commandeer must be classically educated. philosophy, history. even a sense of the dramatic. do you know what i did before the war? do you think i was in the army? i sold copying machines. i was a salesman. the talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me.

speaker1: if nathan holn hadn't come along, i'd still be selling copying machines. can you imagine the wasted life? can you imagine the magnitude of it? but war... war gives men like me a chance. 
speaker1: here... 'the prize is often left unclaimed. have the courage to grasp it. for fortune always favors the bold.' it always inspires me. i have a design for the future. a master plan. i'll need able officers to carry it out. you have the intelligence. if your heart matches, you'll go far. we'll talk more in the weeks to come. dismissed.
speaker1: issue the binoculars to a scout.
speaker2: and the book, sir?
speaker1: burn it.
speaker1: quit moving.

speaker1: what happened? 
speaker1: what did he say?
speaker2: nothing.
speaker1: did he say anything about me?
speaker2: no.
speaker2: we got to get out of here.
speaker1: what are you talking about?
speaker2: escaping. you ever hear of st. rose? it's on the coast. they say it's a paradise. they've even got electric lights.
speaker1: we can't.
speaker2: between the three of us, we could --
speaker1: no, no. i can't. i like it here. i like being a part of something.

speaker1: one of you dogs has earned himself a treat. over there. 
speaker1: those men hunted themselves a lion this morning. must've been a zoo around here before the war. anyhow, they shot him and he crawled into that thicket. a third man went in after him. we don't know if he's dead or alive. i need a volunteer. someone's gotta go in and get our boy out.
speaker2: i'll go.
speaker1: i guess size ain't a measure of courage, is it? shakespeare! the fix is in. the postman steps out of line.

speaker1: i don't think so, captain. 
speaker1: come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak.
speaker2: maybe you'll find your st. rose up there.
speaker2: what are you waiting for, christmas?

speaker1: why are you stopping? 
speaker2: i found him.
speaker1: he alive?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: bring him out.

speaker1: in the water. come back without him and you and another man will die in his place. 
speaker2: go! go!
speaker3: i'll get him, sir.

speaker1: my army. i like the sound of that. 
speaker2: don't --
speaker1: i got him! over --
speaker3: they sent me to kill you.
speaker2: come with me.
speaker4: good, boy. get him.
speaker3: it's you or me.
speaker2: i know.
speaker4: finish it.
speaker3: no harness on my back.

speaker1: 'jerry ball, pine view.' 
speaker1: so, arrest me. here's a piece of good news. jerry's decided to go to school to get his contractor's license.

speaker1: thanks for being there for me. here's to you. i consider my taxes very well spent. 
speaker1: all dressed up. nowhere to go.

speaker1: greetings, pine view, oregon! 
speaker2: just head back the way you came. pine view ain't buying, ain't listening and don't give charity.
speaker1: civilian, i'm on official business. i demand entry into the town of pine view.
speaker3: what the are you talking about?
speaker1: i'm through talking to you, buddy boy! now get somebody with authority to open this gate!
speaker4: i'm sheriff briscoe. who the are you?
speaker1: i'm a representative of the united states government -- an uproar. he makes himself heard above it.

speaker1: authorized by order 417 of the restored congress to reestablish a communication route to idaho and lower oregon. now open that gate! 
speaker2: what does that mean in english?
speaker1: i'm your postman!
speaker2: hand me your gun.
speaker1: understand that tampering with or obstructing the mail is a federal offense. furthermore, the bolin act requires you to provide all mail carriers with sanctuary and nourishment. now open that gate!
speaker2: you got three seconds to get your outta here.
speaker1: is jerry the contractor here?
speaker1: wait! i'm going to get something out of my bag.
speaker2: one!
speaker1: paul davis! 124 vernon street!
speaker2: never heard of him. two!

speaker1: lois kent! 14 weymoth lane! 
speaker2: three!
speaker1: irene march! 478 river road!

speaker1: did he say my name? 
speaker2: oh, no...
speaker1: i'm irene march.
speaker2: i have a letter for you.
speaker1: would you read it?
speaker2: i'm sure it's personal.
speaker1: please. someone has to.

speaker1: we're delivering the old stock piles, but i'll accept all new correspondence as well. 
speaker2: just read it, will ya?
speaker1: 'dear irene. sorry i haven't written. everything's so crazy. the strange weather. the food shortages. that farmer nathan holn causing all that trouble. it's hard to understand. david's home from the army. the war was over before he even got there. thank for that. he's still my baby no matter how big he gets. we're going to miss you for christmas, but maybe next year. all our love. donna.'
speaker3: my sister in denver. fifteen years ago. thank you.
speaker3: you're a godsend. a savior.
speaker1: no. i'm just... a postman.
speaker1: i've been on the road a while. i could use a little something to eat --

speaker1: oh, yes, absolutely... is there anything else? 
speaker2: yes, there is! if there are dogs in this town, you have to leash them while i'm here!

speaker1: thanks. didn't somebody say something about dinner? 
speaker2: yeah, i'm supposed to take you to foster's. my name's ford. ford lincoln mercury.
speaker2: used to be john stevens, but i changed it on account of i want to drive cars.

speaker1: i live in that car. a 2003 pontiac sinatra. with a nine- banger and a q-eight. 
speaker2: v-eight. eight cylinders. that means an eight-banger.
speaker1: were they fast?
speaker1: a buck seventy-five on a strip.

speaker1: a buck seventy-five? i thought maybe i could fix some of them up. it's nothing compared to what you do. 
speaker2: the important thing to remember about cars is, you can't eat 'em.

speaker1: tell us about the government! 
speaker2: yes, tell us everything!
speaker3: is there a president?
speaker4: yeah.
speaker5: what's his name?
speaker4: you know, i'm pretty hungry.

speaker1: his name is, uh... richard starkey. from maine. he has a saying. 'things are getting better, getting better all the time.' 
speaker2: he a democrat or a republican?
speaker1: parties are over with. the individual is what counts. you vote for the best man.
speaker3: what about europe? any word?
speaker1: lady di's in charge. sixty years old and she still kicks ass.
speaker4: is nathan holn still alive?
speaker1: he died. skin cancer.
speaker5: and the holnists? they're still out there. what's the government going to do about them?
speaker1: the government's just getting started. you're on your own for at least eighteen months.

speaker1: what about the marines corp? 
speaker2: be quiet, everyone! can't we just let this man eat?

speaker1: never thought i'd hear myself say this, but i can't eat anymore. 
speaker1: what?
speaker1: this?
speaker1: almost fits.
speaker2: that's not a toy, honey. that's very important. give it back.

speaker1: would you like to dance? 
speaker2: i don't know if i can, i think i'm still on duty.
speaker2: it's been a long time.
speaker1: all you got to do is hold on.

speaker1: is something wrong? 
speaker2: how tall are you?
speaker1: about six feet.
speaker2: are you smart?
speaker1: smarter than some i guess. why?
speaker2: just wondering. did you ever have the bad mumps? the postman smiles. she's odd, but beautiful.
speaker1: never had the bad mumps.

speaker1: have you ever had herpes or syphilis or anything like that? 
speaker1: so as far as you know, you have good semen?
speaker2: is that a trick question?
speaker1: i don't mean to be nosy. i'm only asking because i want you to make me pregnant.
speaker2: it's got to be the uniform.
speaker1: this is my husband. michael.
speaker1: we've been trying to have a baby for three years. we can't on account of michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve. so we need a body father. we could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble. i've seen it happen. things go okay until the woman starts to show. then it can be bad. but you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail.
speaker1: he hasn't said 'no'.

speaker1: what do you say, mister? you'd be doing us a favor. 
speaker2: i'll have to think about it.
speaker3: mrs. march wants to give you something. he's right here, irene.
speaker4: it's to my daughter annie. she left five years ago. she was only fifteen. the last i heard, she was living up north... the postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the faces around him, to mrs. march. she looks blindly back.
speaker2: look, mrs. march, you should know that...
speaker4: know what?
speaker2: know that...
speaker4: i have a feeling about you. i know you'll do what's right.
speaker2: i got to get out of here.

speaker1: it's right around the corner. 
speaker2: what is?
speaker1: what you're looking for.

speaker1: i knew you'd come here. 
speaker2: you did, huh?
speaker1: how do you get to be a postman, anyhow?
speaker2: you have to be in the right place at the right time.
speaker1: how could i do it?

speaker1: i thought you wanted to drive cars. 
speaker2: not anymore. that was kid's stuff. this is real. so, where's the right place?
speaker1: could be anywhere. anytime. only another postman can make you a postman.
speaker2: kinda like vampires, right?
speaker1: something like that. you have to be sworn in.
speaker1: the organization's kinda shaky.
speaker2: what does?
speaker1: you'd meet a lot of people who don't believe in you.
speaker2: i'll set them straight.
speaker1: it's a lonely job.
speaker2: i've been lonely all my life.
speaker1: so have i, ford. so have i.

speaker1: what the hell? repeat after me. 
speaker2: neither snow, nor rain, nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.
speaker1: okay then.
speaker3: okay, then.
speaker1: no, no, no, i'm saying that. you just listen... by my authority you are now empowered to carry the mail. congratulations, you're a postman.
speaker3: i want you to know i'd die to get a letter through.
speaker4: johnny, why don't you run along. i need to speak to this man.
speaker3: i'll see you around.
speaker1: sure thing, ford.
speaker4: johnny's real impressed with you. whole town's real impressed with you.

speaker1: i take it you're not. 
speaker2: smarter than you look.
speaker1: what can i do for you, sheriff?
speaker2: you can clear out. or i can throw you out. either way suits me fine.
speaker1: i'm afraid you don't understand, sheriff. i'm a government employee. authorized by --
speaker2: you're not authorized by you're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. and i want you out of my town.
speaker1: this is going in my report.
speaker2: these people don't need dreams, mr. postman. they need something real. they need help with the holnists. are you going to bring them that? didn't think so. all you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts. i aim to keep it that way. you can stay till morning. then i don't ever want to see you again.

speaker1: just leave it. 
speaker1: i said leave it.
speaker1: hello, abby.
speaker2: you'll be leaving tomorrow?
speaker1: i guess.

speaker1: everybody's up late writing letters for you to take. we're not supposed to waste candles like that, but they're so excited. 
speaker2: how about you? do you have a letter?
speaker1: i don't have anybody to write to.
speaker2: i'll find you a pen pal. someone with interests similar to your own. dancing, checking for mumps.
speaker1: you're funny. hardly anyone's funny around here.
speaker2: i guess no one feels much like laughing.
speaker1: have you decided yet?
speaker2: oh, well, i've been thinking about it.
speaker2: sure. why not?
speaker2: you're beautiful. sorry, i know you'd probably like to keep things more clinical. you don't even know my name.

speaker1: i don't want to. 
speaker1: it would be easier for me if you closed your eyes.

speaker1: what about those? 
speaker2: these are going to blue jay. about twenty miles east. i thought i could take them.
speaker1: okay. they're yours.
speaker3: i'm your out of town.

speaker1: we took a vote, mr. postman. we want you to have this horse. 
speaker2: now don't say no. a man on horseback can cover ten times the territory of a man on foot.
speaker3: i'll take it.
speaker4: there's a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.
speaker3: thank you.
speaker1: where do you figure you'll go from here?
speaker3: go?... oh yeah... i'll head west, then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight. "8." everyone's quiet a moment. they shift
speaker3: times seem hard right now. but you have to believe it's getting better. birds are migrating again. the rains are back.
speaker5: 'oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain. for purple mountain's majesty, above the fruited plain. america...'

speaker1: you got a helluva nerve, whoever you are. 
speaker2: is abby around?
speaker1: she and michael are working the north meadow this morning.
speaker1: well, you're on your own.
speaker1: hey! are you really who you say you are?
speaker2: if i come back with some mail, you'll know!
speaker1: it!

speaker1: eugene. benning. portland. boston! seattle. boise... st. rose, paradise on the pacific... 
speaker1: maybe one thing can still be sacred. all in all, not a bad gig, huh?

speaker1: what are you looking at? 
speaker2: everything.
speaker3: holnists! holnists are coming!

speaker1: holnists, johnny. you gotta stay out of sight. 
speaker2: i'm a postman. and i'm not hiding from anyone. i --
speaker1: you stay out of this, or i'll lock you up myself damnit.
speaker3: you. you'll be responsible. get him a torch.
speaker3: set that flag on fire.

speaker1: the united states doesn't exist. that flag is an abomination. 
speaker2: general bethlehem. we're gathering the tribute, sir. can i take your wagons?
speaker1: make sure that fire doesn't go out. the general joins briscoe.

speaker1: tell the sheriff i want to be introduced. she does not belong in a mudhole like this. 
speaker2: excuse me.
speaker1: you again?
speaker2: that's my wife, general. she's a married woman.
speaker1: do you know what system of government we have here, son? a feudal system. like the middle ages. with lords and vassals. that's you and me. those lords, they had some ideas. if a vassal got married, it was the lord's right, his right, to sleep with the bride on the wedding night.
speaker2: me and abby have been married for three years.
speaker1: sorry, but i wasn't invited to the wedding. now, you've already done me one favor, son. don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record.

speaker1: we'll be civilized about this. i want you to give me your blessing. 
speaker2: sir, i can't. you can't.
speaker1: can't? i'm tired of can't. we had a great nation once. do you know what made it that way? i can! till the weak came along. the 'i can'ts' destroyed us. but i'm going to make us strong again. i'm going to be the father of a new nation. do you know why it will be me?
speaker1: because i can!
speaker3: michael!
speaker4: you didn't have to --
speaker1: didn't have to what, sheriff?
speaker1: your people seem seditious. you seem seditious.

speaker1: aw, michael... 
speaker2: what am i seeing here? i'm waiting.
speaker1: man came through here. with mail. said he was a postman. said the government had been restored back east.
speaker2: what government?
speaker3: the united states government.
speaker2: who said that?
speaker2: which way did he go? do not make me ask again.
speaker1: east.
speaker2: send a patrol east. send three more south, north and west. they'd better find him east.

speaker1: i managed to save these. 
speaker2: take that thing off, johnny. you want to die, too? ford shoves the letters in a makeshift bag, then climbs onto his waiting pony.
speaker1: i'm headed south. with the mail.
speaker2: don't be a fool.
speaker1: what kind should i be?... haw!

speaker1: rachel clark! charlie sykes! graham druitt! 
speaker2: g.d. died last winter of flu.
speaker1: that's it for now, folks. there'll be more once a real system is in place.

speaker1: tell us about president starkey! 
speaker2: what about new york city? did they survive the plague?
speaker3: survive? they got broadway up and running again. there's a kid doing andrew lloyd webber like you wouldn't believe.
speaker4: how much is it to mail a letter?
speaker3: a buck seventy-five.
speaker4: that sounds awful cheap.
speaker3: the catch is the only currency recognized are silver american coins minted before 1964 and two dollar bills. look for thomas jefferson. of course, food is always acceptable as barter.

speaker1: they won't open the gates, sir. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: they say they got a representative of the restored united states in there. they say this army is illegal. they say --
speaker3: drop dead and go to hell!
speaker2: the romans had an expression they used to scare their children. 'hannibal ad portas!' -- hannibal is at the gates. do you know who hannibal was? of course not. a pretty girl like you wouldn't know a thing. colonel getty, get some men up there and open that gate.

speaker1: what the are you doing?! 
speaker2: government's restored! we don't have to take their anymore!

speaker1: idiots! 
speaker2: they're gonna kill us all.
speaker3: no! let's fight them!
speaker1: with what? we got five guns maybe 20 rounds of ammo in the whole town! how do we fight them with that?!
speaker4: you don't. negotiate a settlement. give them extra supplies.
speaker1: okay. you're a government rep. you go tell them.

speaker1: make it quick. i've got an attack to coordinate. 
speaker2: general, um, they've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty.
speaker1: do i know you?
speaker2: i don't think so, sir. i --
speaker1: you're the postman, aren't you?

speaker1: the restored united states. do these people really believe that who are you really? 
speaker2: i am a united states postman. authorized by order 417 of the restored congress to --

speaker1: i was at the battle of georgetown. i watched the white house burn to the ground. don't try to sell me on any restored u.s... 
speaker2: the new capital is based in minneapolis. inside the hubert humphrey metrodome. you know, where the vikings used to play?
speaker1: you're funny. now, what are the terms?
speaker2: they'll open the gate and give you double what they usually give. just don't hurt anybody. this was all a misunderstanding.

speaker1: law six, justice can be dictated. kill him. and kill the restored united states with him. 
speaker1: get her.

speaker1: colonel getty! 
speaker2: we can't stop now. they'll be coming after us.
speaker3: abby...

speaker1: don't move. 
speaker2: if you'd had a bullet, you'd a used it by now.
speaker1: you're right.

speaker1: i don't think i ever had water soup before. maybe next time we could try it with a little sand? dirt? wood? a twig garnish? 
speaker1: you used to think i was funny.
speaker2: they killed michael.
speaker1: i'm sorry.
speaker2: how sorry are you?
speaker1: what's that supposed to mean?
speaker1: what's with you?
speaker2: you got the mark of eight on you.
speaker1: a mark doesn't mean i'm a --
speaker2: you're a liar. i should've let you die.
speaker1: then, why didn't you?

speaker1: you were with bethlehem. does that make you one of them? 
speaker1: don't make me use this.

speaker1: wind's come up. getting colder too. must be another storm -- abby gets up and throws a log on the fire. 
speaker2: anything else?
speaker1: i didn't mean for you to --
speaker2: your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk.
speaker1: i'm hurt.

speaker1: you're lazy. 
speaker2: lazy?! i got a hole in my stomach. i'm weak. the two big meals around here are grass and snow. and we're running out of grass.
speaker2: where are you going?
speaker2: you're not leaving me here, are you?

speaker1: this is the last of it. 
speaker2: give me a break...
speaker1: i'm going to check the pass.
speaker2: why are you in such a hurry to get out of here? i can think of worse places. and worse company to -- and with the slam of the door she is gone.

speaker1: i told you that's all there was. 
speaker2: that's why you should have it.
speaker1: i knew you could walk.
speaker2: you're weird, you know that?

speaker1: we walked on the moon once, abby. 
speaker2: so? what good is that now?
speaker1: obviously you've forgotten tang and microwave ovens. your face looks pretty.
speaker1: not so bruised.
speaker2: look, there's something you'd better know. you're going to find out soon enough. i'm pregnant. it's michael's baby. you're just the body father.
speaker1: how do you know it's mine and not bethlehem's?
speaker2: he tried with me almost every night. he couldn't do it. so he beat me. said it was my fault.

speaker1: abby. 
speaker1: what is it? what's wrong? is it the baby?
speaker2: the pass is clear. it's time to go.

speaker1: what happened? 
speaker1: you got our stuff out.
speaker2: of course.

speaker1: of course? i don't understand. 
speaker2: i set the fire.
speaker1: am i missing the point here?
speaker2: you didn't think we'd stay here forever, did you? i'd appreciate if you'd walk with me long enough to find someplace safe for the baby. then we can split up. you shaved.
speaker1: yeah...
speaker2: it looks nice.
speaker1: you're really weird, you know that?

speaker1: have you ever heard of st. rose, abby? 
speaker2: i've heard people talk. i've heard lots of names. bliss. hesperia. new eden. sheriff briscoe says it's a fantasy.

speaker1: he's wrong. st. rose is out there. and i'm going to find it. 
speaker2: but you're the postman.
speaker1: look, i'm nobody, abby. i'm just...
speaker1: this is what i hate. strangers. do you say 'hi' or do you blow their head off? do they want to share what they got or take what you have? and if they want to take, how far are you willing to go to stop them? it. all right. that's far enough.
speaker1: we don't want any trouble.
speaker3: me neither, mister.
speaker2: what are you?
speaker4: carrier 18. u.s. postal service. got any mail?
speaker1: that's impossible.

speaker1: ain't you heard of the postman? 
speaker2: no, tell us.
speaker1: he's only the greatest man who ever lived. he crossed the wasteland, shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of general bethlehem himself. he's back east with president starkey right now.
speaker3: who told you all this?
speaker1: postmaster ford lincoln mercury. he's in direct contact with the restored congress.
speaker3: direct contact... i don't believe this.
speaker1: do you have mail, or don't you?
speaker3: you said carrier eighteen. that mean there's eighteen of you?
speaker1: thirty-two. as of midnight.

speaker1: more recruits? 
speaker2: seven of them. they're coming from everywhere.
speaker3: did you get a letter or didn't you?
speaker1: gather 'round, everybody. got another letter here. came in last night.

speaker1: what's all this? 
speaker2: postman sent ford another letter.
speaker3: 'hello, all postal carriers.'
speaker4: hello!

speaker1: i'm here in minneapolis with president starkey, but my thoughts are with you. remember, nothing worth doing can be done overnight. keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot. signed, the postman. 
speaker2: his letters are always kind of short.
speaker3: holy
speaker4: that would be h.s., chubby.
speaker3: i seen him once when i lived in benning. it's the postman! word goes through the crowd like a wave.
speaker5: p.s. ford knows what to do.
speaker1: guess you want to talk about this?

speaker1: i found him! i found him! 
speaker2: president starkey? minneapolis?
speaker3: i thought you were dead.
speaker2: so? i'm not making the connection. what's all this then?
speaker3: i lied. i told people you were in contact with me.
speaker2: why?
speaker3: because i didn't want it to end.
speaker2: i don't know how long i can stay, ford. president starkey will send word one day and i'll have to move on. understand?
speaker3: sure. but you'll stay till he sends word? right?

speaker1: aw, don't do that. hands down. 
speaker2: you'll stay 'til president starkey sends word, right? right?
speaker1: yeah, till he sends word, right.
speaker2: could you say a few words?
speaker1: two plus two equals four.

speaker1: you spelled tyranny wrong. 
speaker2: boy, he's smart.

speaker1: neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night... 
speaker2: how old are you?
speaker3: seventy-five, sir.
speaker2: can you ride?
speaker3: nope. can't walk too good, either.
speaker2: why are you here?
speaker3: i know stuff.

speaker1: when did you get that? 
speaker2: 1970. a girl with eyes as big as saucers did me in a little town called saigon.

speaker1: abby -- 
speaker2: yes?
speaker1: ford wants me to have his trailer.
speaker2: i'm on the other side of town.
speaker1: i got plenty of room here.
speaker1: so much for the uniform theory.

speaker1: what do you think, lieutenant? 
speaker2: can't tell what it is if you stand too close. the colors all kinda run together, don't they?
speaker1: yes...
speaker1: well, if it isn't our old friend the u.p.s. man.
speaker2: we captured him on the oregon border.
speaker1: who the are you?
speaker3: carrier twelve. united states, um, postal service.
speaker1: i want the camp struck at dawn.
speaker2: yes, sir.
speaker1: you spelled tyranny wrong.

speaker1: i wish they'd stop saluting. 
speaker1: just stay safe and remember. the mailman's more important than the mail.
speaker2: boy, he's smart.
speaker1: what the hell?

speaker1: for president starkey and the first congress of the restored united states, i officially declare postal station 10... 
speaker2: we never named it.
speaker1: i officially declare postal station 10 in elvis, oregon, open for business!

speaker1: i'm back! and i got mail. 
speaker2: i'll be

speaker1: bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to whoever brings you in. dead or alive. 
speaker2: thank it wasn't a carton of cigarettes.
speaker3: i'd have shot you myself.

speaker1: things are getting better. getting better all the time. i don't know who you are, but i do know i was wrong about you. 
speaker2: got a letter for you, sheriff.
speaker1: it's from my sister. i thought she was dead.

speaker1: births and deaths, the weather, gossip. there's nothing here. 
speaker2: nothing? everything is here. am i the only one who sees that? get out!
speaker2: give the people back their hope and their dreams won't be far behind.
speaker2: what is it, getty?

speaker1: who do you talk to? 
speaker2: not a soul in seven years of trying. but i will.
speaker2: go ahead. take a look. want some?
speaker1: no. no thanks. hey, don't let the kids see that.
speaker2: i was an aerospace engineer. i helped design the galileo space station. i dream it's orbiting earth forever. with a dozen human skeletons all grinning at each other. laughing at us down here.
speaker1: what is it?

speaker1: it's red. he's overdue. 
speaker2: that makes five. all on southern routes.

speaker1: get this mail sorted. bring me a fresh horse. something to eat. 
speaker1: and all the mail going south!
speaker1: they changed the oath.

speaker1: ford's idea. 
speaker2: figures. they don't think to ask who they're replacing. or why.
speaker3: sir? it'd be an honor if i could shake your hand.
speaker3: sir?
speaker2: you look like... do i know you?
speaker3: no, sir.
speaker2: well, good luck to you.
speaker2: nice kid. probably be dead in a week.
speaker1: you're exhausted. you need rest. there's food in the trailer -- ponytail rides by; two sacks of mail hang from her saddle pommel. the postman grabs her horse's halter, stops her.
speaker2: where are you going?
speaker4: route twenty-two. i'm already an hour late.

speaker1: you're grounded. get off the horse. you know the rule. 
speaker2: what rule?
speaker1: twenty-two's too far south.
speaker2: but they're waiting on their mail down there.
speaker1: get off the horse.
speaker1: tie him off to this one.
speaker3: you can't keep doing this.
speaker1: doing what?
speaker3: riding all the routes. you're not saving anyone.
speaker1: did i ever tell you how i got to be a postman, abby? i don't know if you'd laugh or cry.

speaker1: ready! 
speaker2: the post office, general?
speaker3: no. let it stand. all by itself. so it can remind them what it cost them.
speaker1: aim!
speaker1: fire!
speaker4: as he realizes he's still standing.
speaker3: you think you can ride? then today's your lucky day.

speaker1: bethlehem says... 
speaker1: ... he's... headed north. he's gonna kill ten people in every town. then burn it to the ground. for what you did...
speaker1: he said to tell you pine view's on his way. he said he'd wait there, but not for long. i was so scared, sir... i thought they were going to kill me, too...

speaker1: what are you going to do? 
speaker2: i'm going to stop this.
speaker1: you can't.

speaker1: get out of my way, ford. all of you. 
speaker2: they'll kill you.
speaker1: goddamnit --
speaker2: you can't help them!
speaker1: there's still time, ford!
speaker3: you're hurting him.
speaker2: no, this is all my doing. i went against your orders.
speaker2: the holnists we killed. you told me to bury them. but i didn't. i sent bethlehem the bodies.
speaker1: why?
speaker2: because bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop.

speaker1: you, ford. those people down there are dying because of us. because of what we did. 
speaker2: they're dying because of bethlehem. they're dying because this is a world. and if we're ever going to change it, then somebody might have to die. if i could make it be me down there i would. but i can't.

speaker1: we know their names. the little one's my brother. his name is billy. 
speaker1: what ford did was wrong. but it doesn't change anything for any of us. does it?

speaker1: he's out there somewhere. watching. i can feel it. 
speaker1: you feel it too, don't you? didn't have to end like this, sheriff. he knew where i'd be if he wanted to face me like a man. instead, he's hiding like a rabbit. so much for your postman.
speaker2: ready! aim!
speaker3: ride, postman! ride! you hear me? i said ride!

speaker1: ford thinks you're going to do something. 
speaker2: i am.
speaker2: if i don't, those kids are going to keep on getting themselves killed.
speaker1: ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid. he doesn't have your memories. none of them do. all they've got is the lousy world we gave them. and this is the only decent thing in it.
speaker2: what? being a postman? it's all bullshit, abby. all of it. i took this uniform off a skeleton to stay warm. i made up the rest to stay fed. there is no restored united states.
speaker1: i knew it was something like that.

speaker1: weird thing is, being a postman was almost the best thing that ever happened to me... remember this? you left it behind that night. 
speaker2: i remember...
speaker1: i always liked to think you left it on purpose. but maybe you just forgot it.

speaker1: is this everybody? 
speaker2: the rest are on the overdue list.
speaker1: this is everybody. got a letter from president starkey.
speaker1: 'greetings all carriers.'
speaker3: greetings, president starkey!
speaker1: 'i've been in contact with the postman. i've received all the reports. i'm proud of you all.' he looks at them, doesn't need to read what's in his heart.

speaker1: in dark days, in a weary world, you gave everything and asked for nothing. you beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you. but the price is too high. i won't see anymore of my bravest die. it is my duty to hereby disband the postal service of the restored united states. you are to burn your uniforms and the postman is to return to minneapolis at once. thank you and that is all. 
speaker2: the president never wrote that letter.
speaker1: if he could've that's what he would have said.
speaker2: who's the other letter to?
speaker1: bethlehem. i'm taking it to him in the morning.
speaker2: what does it say?
speaker1: mail's private. you know that.
speaker2: what does it say?
speaker1: it says it's over. it says we quit.

speaker1: it says you quit. what about the oath? 
speaker2: tell me something, ford. how much mail can a dead postman deliver? it's over.
speaker1: then i'll take it.
speaker2: i can't trust you.
speaker1: if this is the end. if this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered. i'll take it.
speaker2: whoever takes this letter probably dies for it.
speaker1: i'm still a postman. you owe it to me... i owe it to me.

speaker1: thought i recognized you. 
speaker2: general bethlehem said... ... you should be on your knees when i do it.
speaker1: i don't give a what that said.
speaker2: the general is a great man.
speaker1: the general is a lunatic.
speaker1: you don't own a thought in that head of yours, do you? you want to see a man?
speaker1: that's a man.
speaker1: you don't understand, do you? you never will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price for it.
speaker1: you ready?
speaker3: yes.

speaker1: good lord, what do we have here? 
speaker2: i'm a representative of the restored united states -- bethlehem backhands ford.
speaker3: he's got a letter. says the postman sent it.
speaker1: a letter?
speaker1: 'bethlehem. this letter is my testimony to the fact that there is no restored united states and there is no postal service.' then who the have we been fighting...? 'my carriers are returning home. in exchange, i'm asking you to let them be. the postman.'
speaker1: he expects me to believe this?
speaker4: it's true, sir. i was there. he disbanded the carriers and rode west.
speaker2: traitor...

speaker1: then i've won. i've won. 
speaker1: you were supposed to kill him.
speaker2: i couldn't get close enough. this one's his second in command.
speaker1: why doesn't that surprise me?
speaker1: bring out the one we found yesterday. they can die together.
speaker3: who are you?
speaker4: name's clark. postal carrier of the restored republic of california. who are you?
speaker3: postmaster ford lincoln mercury.
speaker5: it's an honor.
speaker1: wait a minute... wait a minute!

speaker1: sir? 
speaker2: hold your fire! you don't know each other? this will never be over. it'll go on except i'll be fighting a ghost.
speaker1: should we fire, sir?
speaker2: no goddamnit.
speaker2: no, i won't fight a ghost. tabula rasa, gentlemen. a clean slate. i want all mail carriers hunted down. i want the postman found. i want him dealt with. colonel, organize the scouts. he rode west?

speaker1: howdy. welcome to sunny california. 
speaker2: what happened here?
speaker1: little accident. the ground started to shake big time and the hanford nuclear plant went... ... 'poof.' destroyed everything for miles. but the sunsets are beautiful.
speaker2: you ever hear of a city called st.
speaker1: friend, i've never heard of st.
speaker1: hey, don't go! i got monopoly in the house! boardwalk, park place and the reading railroad!

speaker1: no. 
speaker2: what makes you so sure?
speaker1: president lives in a white house. that guy's place is gray.

speaker1: we can rest in there. abby is quick to agree. 
speaker1: did you see that?
speaker2: i'm hungry, postman.

speaker1: set the rifle on the ground. 
speaker2: this old thing? it isn't even loaded. where are we?
speaker3: you're in bridge city. where we don't allow guns.
speaker3: sentry said you were coming.
speaker2: i know you. you're famous.
speaker3: i was once. not anymore. are you looking to cross?
speaker2: we will be. right now, we'd just appreciate some food. i got some kids behind me, too.

speaker1: how many? 
speaker2: three. hey, guys, come on in! i know you're out there!
speaker3: boy, is he smart...
speaker1: for you and your wife.
speaker2: thanks. she's not my wife.
speaker2: let me ask you something, have you ever heard of a town with electric lights?
speaker1: st. rose?
speaker2: yeah!
speaker1: never been. but they say it's a ways down on the coast.
speaker2: how far?

speaker1: couple hundred miles at least. i couldn't say for sure. 
speaker2: you seem like a decent man. and these seem like decent people.
speaker1: we try to be.
speaker2: and this seems like a safe place.
speaker1: you want to leave her?
speaker2: all of them. i'll give you the horses and my gear. abby's special. she's strong. probably end up running the place.
speaker1: why don't you take the night to think. decide if that's what you really want.

speaker1: they're looking for the postman. 
speaker2: no such thing anymore.
speaker1: man on the horse says there is. says he thinks he's here. says he's coming back with friends.
speaker3: what's a postman?
speaker4: you never heard of a postman?
speaker4: there used to be a postman for every street in america. they wore uniforms. and hats. like this one...
speaker3: wow...

speaker1: my postman knew the name of every kid on my street. he knew our birthdays. he'd even find the baseballs you'd hit down the street. i can still see the smile on his face. the tip of his cap -- when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it. mine always came just after school. you could set your watch by him. unless you were waiting on something special -- like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from your sweetheart. then it seemed like he'd never come. i used to think they could make time stand still. 
speaker1: i don't think we ever really understood what they meant to us until they were gone. getting a letter made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself. no place was ever too far away for the postman. so nobody ever had to be alone. the postman was someone you could count on. things just made more sense when they were around. that's the kind of world we used to have. a world a lot of us took for granted. and now we've got this one. and it makes me wonder -- what kind of world do i want my child to live in? i want my child to live in a world where hopes and dreams aren't just lies you tell yourself to get through another day. i want my child, and i want my friends -- i want all of us to live in a world where you still get your mail.
speaker2: are you the postman?

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: i've heard of you, man. you're famous.
speaker1: yeah, i guess i am. and all of a sudden, i'm not wearing the right clothes.

speaker1: fact that we don't allow 'em doesn't mean we don't have 'em. 
speaker2: i'm sorry i've brought this on you.
speaker1: no need to be sorry. long as we get our mail on time.
speaker3: ready for duty, sir.
speaker2: the order was to burn all uniforms.

speaker1: you know what to do then? 
speaker2: talk to the people. gather who's willing. tell them it's important. tell them we can make a difference.
speaker3: and tell 'em we're going to kick ass.
speaker1: yeah, tell them that, too.

speaker1: this is hard for me. michael was the best man i ever knew. i never thought there'd be another man i could love the way i loved him. i don't know why i've been so blessed. and i've tried to find a way to be thankful, but i swear, if i lose you... 
speaker2: abby, do you think a lie can become the truth?
speaker1: i don't know, but i believe in you. you have a gift, postman. i saw it back in pine view.

speaker1: you made mrs. march feel like she could see again. you made ford feel like he was part of the world. you give out hope like it was candy in your pocket. 
speaker1: when you come back, we'll be waiting here for you. so you can take us to st. rose.
speaker2: there's three good-sized towns up that way. enough folks to be a big help to you. if you can convince them to come.
speaker2: a lot higher than it looks, huh?
speaker2: don't tell anybody, but i like to ride the thing just for the of it. being a city official has its perks.
speaker2: trust me, man. this'll get you there a lot faster.
speaker3: how do i stop --

speaker1: steady, boys, steady. 
speaker2: in accordance with law eight...
speaker1: get on with it, you floppy-eared sonuvabitch!

speaker1: ... we were outnumbered, sir. 
speaker2: how many?
speaker1: a least a hundred. with guns.
speaker2: with guns? are you sure?
speaker1: yes, sir...
speaker2: looks more like two hundred to me...
speaker2: only thing worse than a coward is one who can't count. lieutenant, do yourself a favor. die well in this battle. in my army a deserter's life is a brief and unpleasant one.
speaker2: reckoning, gentlemen. this is the day i've dreamed of.

speaker1: are they surrendering? 
speaker2: i hope not.

speaker1: as they come face-to-face. 
speaker2: my little shipping clerk.
speaker3: we're both a couple of frauds. you know it; i know it.
speaker2: great men are made by other great men. patton had rommel. grant had lee. but i get you.
speaker4: you're no general. you're a copying machine salesman.
speaker2: are you trying to goad me into a fight?
speaker3: wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the who started them? we could settle this thing right here. you and me.
speaker2: unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
speaker3: it does in your army.
speaker3: i invoke law seven of the laws of eight! any man may challenge for leadership of the clan!

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: i challenge you.
speaker1: you're not a holnist. you're not a member of the clan. you don't have the right.
speaker2: i have every right. i invoke law seven!
speaker2: i challenge for leadership of the clan!
speaker1: where do i know you from?
speaker2: 'cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war.' remember that?
speaker1: shakespeare. the one who didn't want to fight.
speaker2: i should've found a way to kill you then. but you seemed so strong.
speaker1: law seven it is. this war is settled here!

speaker1: i study people. i know your problem. do you know why you can't fight? 
speaker1: you have nothing to fight for. you don't care about anything. you don't value anything. you don't believe in anything. that's what makes me better.
speaker2: i believe in the united states postal service.

speaker1: neither snow... nor rain... nor heat... nor gloom of night... will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds... 
speaker1: it doesn't have to be this way. we don't have to kill each other. we can live together. we can --
speaker2: law three. mercy is for the weak.
speaker1: ford, don't...
speaker2: law eight. there is only one penalty and that penalty is death.

speaker1: he isn't worth it. i'm the head of the clan now! there are going to be new laws! law one! no more killing! there's going to be peace! 
speaker1: who else? who else has a law?
speaker2: everyone has to learn how to read.
speaker1: that's law two. who else?!
speaker3: three. liberty and justice for all!
speaker4: four. no more tattoos.
speaker5: law five. give peace a chance!
speaker6: law six. mercy is, it's okay sometimes!
speaker7: seven! bring back vacations!
speaker1: how about it, ford lincoln mercury? you give us law eight.
speaker1: be a leader, ford.
speaker8: law eight...

speaker1: ... live and let live. 
speaker2: would i had bestowed that time in the tongues that i have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting. oh, had i but followed the arts...
speaker3: grow like savages -- as soldiers will -- that nothing do but mediate on blood.
speaker3: somebody take a letter.
speaker4: huh?
speaker3: a letter...

speaker1: mail's slow. i'll have to see about that.
