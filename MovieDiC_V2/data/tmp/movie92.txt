THIRD DRAFT: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 1.

ANGELA: my it's hot. i stepped out of the shower and stared sweating again. ... it's still burning? it's bigger! and i thought you were making me hear those sirens. what is it? 
RACINE: the seawater inn. my family used to eat dinner there twenty-five years ago. now somebody's torched it to clear the lot.
ANGELA: that's a shame.
RACINE: probably one of my clients.
ANGELA: i'm leaving.
RACINE: it's four a.m.
ANGELA: i go on duty at miami airport at seven.

ANGELA: i wouldn't mind having breakfast... what do you care? you're watching the fire. you're done with me. i'm just getting into my uniform here... 
ANGELA: you've had your fun. you're spent. i'll just slip into my uniform here and slip away.
RACINE: my history's burning up out here.
ANGELA: hey, i don't mind. i'm leaving. why do they make these skirts so hard to zip...
RACINE: where's your hat?
ANGELA: hey... hey... ... don't wrinkle it!
RACINE: 'you're spent.' where'd you hear that?

JUDGE COSTANZA: ever actually en route from indiana or not. i think we're wasting our time here. it's pretty clear your client has attempted to defraud the county in a not very ingenious manner. the assistant prosecutor has made what i consider a generous offer. and given that you've failed to generate even the semblance of a defense -- 
RACINE: judge costanza, perhaps when i've presented all --
JUDGE COSTANZA: yeah, yeah. if i were you, i'd recommend to your client that held quickly do as mr. lowenstein here has suggested -- plead nolo contendre, file chapter eleven and agree never to do business with okeelanta county again.
RACINE: you would look favorably on that?
JUDGE COSTANZA: he can walk. but don't test my patience for even five more minutes.
RACINE: i'll talk to him.
JUDGE COSTANZA: mr. racine. next time you come into my courtroom i hope you've got either a better defense or a better class of client.
RACINE: thank you, your honor.

LOWENSTEIN: -- i think i've underestimated you, ned. i don't know why it took me so long. you've started using your incompetence as a weapon. 
RACINE: my defense was evolving. you guys got scared. costanza doesn't like me. what'd i do to him?
LOWENSTEIN: he's an unhappy man, thinks he should be circuit court by now. here he is in a state with really top-notch corruption and he's stuck with the county toilets. i'm surprised you weren't in on that toilet caper. could have been that quick score you've always been searching for.
RACINE: maybe costanza was in on it. that's why he was mad.
STELLA: what's the word from the hallowed halls of justice? anything juicy?
LOWENSTEIN: maybe stella was in on it. stella, when you gonna get a real air conditioner in here.
LOWENSTEIN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 5.
STELLA: you don't like it there's lots of other places.
LOWENSTEIN: they don't have you. gotta go.
LOWENSTEIN: you can't buy me. no sirree, i don't come cheap.
A VOICE: lowenstein, you're a fag.
STELLA: why does he do that?
RACINE: he's pretty good, that's the weird part.
STELLA: did you hear about dr. block?
RACINE: no. do i want to?
STELLA: agnes marshall.
RACINE: that must have been mrs. block's idea, some kind of punishment.
STELLA: it was! how'd you know? christ, you're plugged in better than me. so you must know about mrs. block's friend in ocean grove.
STELLA: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 6.
RACINE: stella, this is beneath even you. things must be slow.
STELLA: it's the heat.

RACINE: mrs. singer, i would have gladly come to the house. 
MRS. SINGER: no. no, the doctor says i should walk and i had some shopping. not that that quack knows what he's talking about. i tell you, mr. racine, i'm not sure his testimony is going to be very useful.
RACINE: don't worry about it. i'll find you a doctor who's more understanding.
MRS. SINGER: oooh, you can't imagine. nothing can make up for the pain they've caused me.
RACINE: how well i know. we'll sue those reckless dry. excuse my language.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 7.
MRS. SINGER: don't apologize. that's the kind of attitude you've got to have these days...

RACINE: you can stand here with me if you want, but you'll have to agree not to talk about the heat. 
MATTY: i'm a married woman.
RACINE: meaning what?
MATTY: meaning i'm not looking for company.
RACINE: then you should have said -- 'i'm a happily married woman.'
MATTY: that's my business.
RACINE: what?
MATTY: how happy i am.
RACINE: and how, happy is that?
MATTY: you're not too smart, are you?
MATTY: i like that in a man.
RACINE: what else you like -- ugly? lazy?
MATTY: you don't look lazy.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 9.
MATTY: tell me, does chat like that work with most women?
RACINE: some. if they haven't been around much.
MATTY: i wondered. thought maybe i was out of touch.
RACINE: how 'bout i buy you a drink?
MATTY: i told you. i've got a husband.
RACINE: i'll buy him one too.
MATTY: he's out of town.
RACINE: my favorite kind. we'll drink to him.
MATTY: he only comes up on the weekends.
RACINE: i'm liking him better all the time. you better take me up on this quick. in another forty-five minutes i'm going to give up and walk away.
MATTY: you want to buy me something? i'll take one of these.
RACINE: what kind?
MATTY: cherry.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 10.
RACINE: make it two.
RACINE: you're not staying in miranda beach. i would have noticed you.
MATTY: is this town that small?
RACINE: pinehaven. you're staying up in pinehaven, on the waterway. you have a house.
MATTY: how'd you know?
RACINE: you look like pinehaven.
MATTY: how does pinehaven look?
RACINE: well tended.
MATTY: yes, i'm well tended, all right.
RACINE: me? i need tending. i need someone to take care of me. rub my tired muscles. smooth out my sheets.
MATTY: get married.
RACINE: i just need it for tonight.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 11.
MATTY: good. nice move, matty.
RACINE: matty. i like it. right over your heart.
MATTY: at least it's cool. i'm burning up.
RACINE: i asked you not to talk about the heat.
MATTY: would you get me a paper towel or something? dip it in some cold water.
RACINE: right away. i'll even wipe it off for you.
MATTY: you don't want to lick it?

MATTY: look who's here. isn't this a coincidence? 
RACINE: i know you.
MATTY: you're the one that doesn't want to talk about the heat. too bad. i'd tell you about my chimes.
RACINE: what about them?
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 14.
MATTY: the wind chimes on my porch. they keep ringing and i go out there expecting a cool breeze. that's what they've always meant. but not this summer, this summer it's just hot air.
RACINE: do i remind you of hot air?
RACINE: bourbon, any kind, on the rocks. another?
MATTY: what are you doing in pinehaven?
RACINE: i'm no yokel. why, i was all the way to miami once.
MATTY: there are some men, once they get a whiff of it, they'll trail you like a hound. the bartender brings their drinks and leaves.
RACINE: i'm not that eager.
MATTY: what is your name, anyway?
RACINE: ned racine.
MATTY: matty walker.
RACINE: are you all right?
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 15.
MATTY: yes. my temperature runs a couple degrees high. around 100 all the time i don't mind it. it's the engine or something.
RACINE: maybe you need a tune-up.
MATTY: don't tell me -- you have just the right tool.
RACINE: i don't talk that way.
MATTY: how'd you find me, ned?
RACINE: this is the only joint in pinehaven.
MATTY: how'd you know i drink?
RACINE: you seemed like a woman with all the vices.
MATTY: you shouldn't have come. you're going to be disappointed. racine looks out over his drink. several of the men in the place are looking at them.
RACINE: what'd i do?
MATTY: a lot of them have tried that seat.
RACINE: you must come here a lot.
MATTY: most men are little boys.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 16.
RACINE: maybe you should drink at home.
MATTY: too quiet.
RACINE: maybe you shouldn't dress like that.
MATTY: this is a blouse and a skirt. i don't know what you're talking about.
RACINE: you shouldn't wear that body.
MATTY: i don't like my body much. it's never been right.
MATTY: sometimes, i don't know. i get so sick of everything, i'm not sure i care anymore. do you know what i mean, ned?
RACINE: i know that sometimes the comes down so heavy i feel like i should wear a hat.
MATTY: yeah, that's what i mean.
MATTY: i think i'll get out of here now.
RACINE: i'll take you.
MATTY: i have a car.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 17.
RACINE: i'll follow you. i want to see the chimes.
MATTY: you want to see the chimes.
RACINE: i want to hear them.
MATTY: that's all. if i let you, that's all.
RACINE: i'm not looking for trouble.
MATTY: i mean it. i like you. but my life is complicated enough.
MATTY: this is my community bar. i might have to come here with my husband some time. would you leave before me? wait in your car? i know it seems silly...
RACINE: i don't know who we're going to fool. you've been pretty friendly.
MATTY: now leave me alone.
RACINE: lady, you must be some kind of crazy!
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 18.

RACINE: what is in there?
MATTY: boat.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 20.
MATTY: it's a mess. there's a row boat, a lot of lounge chairs... things like that.
MATTY: i think you should go now.
RACINE: i just got here.
MATTY: you've seen them. please go.

RACINE: you didn't bring me here to see your wind chimes. 
MATTY: yes, i did. i said what i meant.

MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 24.
RACINE: hey, gimme a break here. it takes a little while.

RACINE: it takes me a good thirty seconds.
MATTY: are you sure? i just want to make sure here. she pulls him down.
RACINE: i think you're right -- -- you better be on the bottom.
MATTY: no, you misunderstood -- -- this is my new saddle, and i just want to --
RACINE: wow! no, i must object --

RACINE: what are you doing? 
MATTY: i've got to wash these.
RACINE: you're afraid of your maid?
MATTY: that's right. my mother told me "knowledge is power."
RACINE: this is an interesting interpretation. is that why you've started smoking my brand?
MATTY: no one must know. promise me, ned. no one.

RACINE: hey, lady, wanna make love? 
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 26.
MARY ANN: i don't know. maybe this sure is a friendly town.
RACINE: i'm sorry.
MARY ANN: you are? you mean the offers no good?

MATTY: mary ann's an old friend. she's like a sister to me. she wants me to be happy.

RACINE: you know, this has never been one of my pleasures. car. i considered the time i spent making it -- -- like this ... penance for some sin. 
MATTY: what sin?
RACINE: i never knew. maybe worshipping women instead of but it never did anything for me.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 29.
MATTY: not even a mercedes? with genuine calf skin upholstery?
RACINE: no.
MATTY: not this?

RACINE: you're killing me. 
MATTY: is there any more ice? i'm burning up.
MATTY: he's coming up tomorrow.
MATTY: i can't stand the thought of him... he's small and mean... and weak.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 30.

MATTY: just do what i say! go into the living room. 
RACINE: come on! it's been three days. i want to see you --
MATTY: i'm going to make it up to you tonight. but you must behave. now go!
RACINE: i'm going. i'm going.

RACINE: i'm here. 
MATTY: good.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 31.

MATTY: don't you like it?
RACINE: you think i'm a kid?
MATTY: you don't like it? i thought you went for this stuff.
MATTY: wait ... wait ... i want to tell you about the thing... the thing that will drop from the ceiling... in case the cabin suddenly depressurizes -- oho...

MATTY: what are we doing here? 
RACINE: listen!
RACINE: i love that sound.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 32.
MATTY: i want to be in bed.
RACINE: is that all you ever think about?
RACINE: hey! i'm kidding.
MATTY: yes ... that's all i ever think about ... you and me. your body near mine, close. i'm not right when you're not with me. i get the shakes. and each time, when i first see you, i shake even more. for a while. and then i get calm. i feel safe ... i've never been this way. i can't remember how i lived before.

RACINE: you look terrible. don't you sleep? 
LOWENSTEIN: i had a dream last night that was so boring it woke me up. i was afraid to go back to sleep. where the have you been?
RACINE: what do you mean, i been around.
LOWENSTEIN: i've barely seen you for a month. wait a minute -- it's some new quiff, isn't it? what's wrong with me.
LOWENSTEIN: you've never been shy about that stuff.
RACINE: oscar.
GRACE: hey. you weren't at the y last week.
LOWENSTEIN: he's getting discreet. i can't believe it.
GRACE: whatcha got in pie today, stella?
STELLA: cherry, cherry... and cherry.
GRACE: what do you recommend?
STELLA: i like the cherry.
STELLA: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 34.
GRACE: bring it on. and a gigantic coke.
LOWENSTEIN: i'm really disappointed, racine. i've been living vicariously off you for years. if you shut up on me, i'll have just my wife.
RACINE: there's nothing to tell. i lead a lonely life.
GRACE: right. and it's gonna snow later today --
LOWENSTEIN: ... and people are basically decent.. ... must be someone i know. let's see -- someone in uniform...
LOWENSTEIN: ...no army personnel around. waitress... could it be... ...stella!
LOWENSTEIN: i know, i know -- you finally got to glenda.
LOWENSTEIN: how was it? did she let you into the no parking zone?
STELLA: i'll have you know glenda is seriously involved with a narc from palm beach.
RACINE: there you are.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 35.
LOWENSTEIN: a narc from palm beach? is that his hobby?
RACINE: how's the cop business, oscar?
GRACE: real good. always starts hoppin' in weather like this. when it gets hot, people try to kill each other.
STELLA: it's true. i could tell you some people who'll be dead if we don't get a break soon.
GRACE: we've got more of everything bad since the wave started. it's the crisis atmosphere. people dress different, feel different, sweat more. they wake up cranky and they never recover. look at lowenstein. things are just a little askew. pretty soon people think the old rules aren't in effect. they start breaking them. figure no one'll care, cause it's emergency time... time out.
LOWENSTEIN: oscar, i just don't understand how you could be doing advanced theoretical thinking like that and still be stuck working in our little town.
GRACE: lowenstein dreams of bigger things.
LOWENSTEIN: assistant county prosecutor isn't the end for me, fellows.
RACINE: hell, no. someday -- deputy county prosecutor.
LOWENSTEIN: when the truth comes out about some of the dirt i've been involved in,

LOWENSTEIN: my future in this state will be unlimited. 
GLENDA: hello, ned.
RACINE: hi, glenda.
MATTY: don't say it, if you don't mean it.
RACINE: i do. i want you with me.
MATTY: i'm going to tell edmund i want a divorce. i won't stay any longer. i would have, if you hadn't come along. the life is comfortable. i was willing to go on. but you've reminded me of what it can be... i know now that these last three years i've been living half a life. it's my fault, i don't deny it. you have to let yourself be bought. i did. i let it happen. i've lived so much of my life with nothing. when you have no money, you have no choices. i don't care what they say -- money is freedom. that's something they don't teach you in school. but i found out. and when edmund came along when i saw a chance to stop struggling i took it. i'm not ashamed.

MATTY: he got what he wanted... he has a knack for that. but no more. i'm ready to walk away from the money. 
RACINE: it is conceivable i'll make a buck someday.
MATTY: oh, i know you will, darling. i didn't mean that. i know you will. but it doesn't matter. it's you i want.
RACINE: anyway, you'll come out all right.
MATTY: of the divorce?
RACINE: yeah. he's ripe.
MATTY: no. i signed a pre-nuptial agreement.
RACINE: what?
MATTY: he insisted. he blamed it on his sister roz -- she's always hated me -- but i know he wanted it too.
RACINE: how is it?
MATTY: bad. i get some money for a year. not much. that's it. but i don't care, ned. not if i can be with you.
MATTY: does it matter, ned? tell me the truth please. i'll understand, i swear to you.
RACINE: the truth? i wish you were going to be loaded. does it matter? no. no.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 38. they kiss.
MATTY: you've made me happy. it's time for your present.
MATTY: from now on, when it starts coming down on you, i'll be there to protect you.
MATTY: put it on! i'll bet i guessed the size right.
MATTY: i love it.
RACINE: i want to see.
MATTY: look in my eyes. can you see yourself?
MATTY: here!
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 39.

BEVERLY: big weekend planned? 
RACINE: nope, small weekend. tiny little weekend.
BEVERLY: there's jazz tonight at the beach...
RACINE: beverly, do yourself a big favor and forget it.
BEVERLY: forget what?
RACINE: whatever you're thinking.

RACINE: yeah. 
MATTY: come to me.
RACINE: did you tell him?
MATTY: no... i couldn't.
RACINE: okay, i'm coming.

RACINE: how do you know? 
MATTY: i saw the will once. he showed it to me. he was trying to prove something ... how much he loved me or something.
RACINE: how'd he get so fat?
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 41.
MATTY: the stock market, investments, real estate. he doesn't tell me anything, but i've picked up a little. i know they own a lot of land along the shore here.
RACINE: who's "they"'
MATTY: he's never introduced me to anyone. i'm not sure if they're all legitimate.
RACINE: i wonder what they call themselves.
MATTY: they own that old place in miranda beach, the breakers... i know that.
RACINE: the breakers? i thought hermie fisher owned that land.
MATTY: ned, it scares me to talk about these things.
RACINE: why?
MATTY: you know.
RACINE: no. i don't.
MATTY: let's just not, okay? let's not think about all he's got.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 42.
RACINE: what is it, matty? tell me exactly what frightens you.
MATTY: i'm afraid... because when i think about it, i wish that he'd die. that's really what i want. it's horrible and ugly and it's what i most want.
RACINE: that's where we're at, isn't it, matty?
MATTY: what do you mean?
RACINE: that's what we're both thinking -- how good it'd be for us if he were gone. it'd be real sweet for us.
MATTY: don't talk about it, ned. please don't. talk is dangerous. sometimes it makes things happen, it makes it real.
RACINE: don't let it scare you. because he's not gonna die. there's nothing wrong with him, is there? there's no reason to think he's gonna die, is there?
RACINE: that's right. so we might as well forget about it, it's not gonna just happen to make things nice for us... it won't just happen.
MATTY: i'm afraid, ned.
RACINE: maybe that's a smart way to be now, matty. maybe we both should be.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 43.
RACINE: the only thing wrong with your husband right now... is us.

RACINE: well, well. hello to you -- 
MATTY: hello.
MATTY: darling, i'd like you to meet mr. racine. i'm sorry. i don't know your first name.
RACINE: ned.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 44.
WALKER: edmund walker. nice to meet you.
MATTY: mr. racine is the lawyer i told you about. you remember. he had a client who wanted to buy the house. i told him we weren't selling.
WALKER: right.
RACINE: that hasn't changed, has it?
WALKER: no, we're very happy with it.
RACINE: i can understand that. it's a terrific place. walker nods, looking at racine carefully. he motions toward the dining room.
WALKER: are you going in?
RACINE: i was just going to grab a bite.
WALKER: join us.
RACINE: no. thanks very much, but i don't want to interfere with -- the hostess has come toward them.
WALKER: don't be silly. come on. we have room for three, don't we?
WALKER: i've heard this place is great. but you can't get near it on the weekends and i don't get down during the week much.
WALKER: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 45.
RACINE: is that right?

WALKER: good school. i got bored with it quick. i guess i didn't have the temperament. i wanted to make the money faster. is there a living in it here? 
RACINE: i can afford to send my shirts out. and eat here once a month, if i don't order an appetizer.
WALKER: i figured an honest lawyer doesn't make much and the other kind was too slimy for me. i'd rather be upfront about shafting somebody.
MATTY: edmund, really. it's mr. racine's profession.
RACINE: that's all right. i don't like it much.
WALKER: what's to like. that's the way of the world. most people despise their jobs.
WALKER: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 46.
RACINE: do you?
WALKER: no. i love it. but it's not a job.
RACINE: what is it, exactly?
WALKER: various things. this and that.
RACINE: you don't have to be specific.
WALKER: finance, basically. venture capital, investments, real estate. we're into a few things.
RACINE: yeah? around here?
WALKER: some. we own some things here.
MATTY: edmund's company owns the breakers.
RACINE: is that right?
WALKER: it's not that simple. we have an interest in a few places along the shore. for the land. you know. someday. there's no explaining it to her.
MATTY: i'll be right back.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 47.
WALKER: she's something, isn't she?
RACINE: a lovely lady.
WALKER: yes, she is. i'm crazy about her. if i ever thought she was seeing another guy... i don't know. i'd understand how it could happen. her being the way she is. i'd understand it. but i think i'd kill the guy with my bare hands.
RACINE: that's understanding.
WALKER: you wouldn't believe the dorkus she was with when i met her. the guy came to us with a business proposition. we're always looking for opportunities. if the conditions are right. we're willing to take an occasional risk, if the downside isn't too steep. but this guy hadn't done his homework, he didn't know the bottom line. that's how i knew he was full of you've got to know the bottom line. that's all that really counts.
WALKER: he didn't have the goods, this guy. he was like a lot of guys you run into -- they want to get rich, they want to do it quick, they want to be there with one score.
WALKER: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 48.
WALKER: but they're not willing to do what's necessary. do you know what i mean?
RACINE: i'm not sure. you mean, lay the groundwork? earn it?
WALKER: no. i mean do what's necessary. whatever's necessary.
RACINE: yeah. i know that kind of guy. i can't stand that. it makes me sick.
WALKER: me too.
RACINE: i'm not like that.

BEVERLY: there are some messages on your desk. 
BEVERLY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 49.

RACINE: did beverly see you? 
MATTY: i waited till i saw her leave. please don't be angry with me.
RACINE: angry? i'm not angry -- how'd you get in?
MATTY: it didn't lock. oh. ned, hold me. please just hold me, i love you.
MATTY: he left this morning. i had to see you.
RACINE: i know.
MATTY: i couldn't call. i'm afraid to call. i was afraid you wouldn't let me come.
RACINE: yes, that's right. you can't call. never call. we have to be very careful now about the phone. the phone company keeps records.
MATTY: i'm careful. i hated it, ned. i hated sitting there with the two of you. i thought i was going to scream.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 50.
RACINE: you did good. you've called my apartment from the house.
MATTY: no, never.
RACINE: no? those two times --
MATTY: i went to phone booths. i'm afraid of him, ned. i'm always afraid.
RACINE: that's good. we have to be careful about the phones now.
MATTY: why, ned, why do you say this now?
RACINE: we could account for a couple calls. we've had some contact. that would make sense. matty grasps his face in her hands and looks into his face.
MATTY: why, ned? what's happened?
RACINE: because we're going to kill him. we both know that.
RACINE: that's what you want, isn't it? we knew it was coming. it's the only way we can get everything we want, isn't it?
RACINE: the man's gonna die for no reason but we want him dead.

RACINE: he doesn't deserve it. let's not ever say that. we're doing it for us. and you're going to inherit half of everything he owns. that's what the will says, right? 
RACINE: that's it then. we're gonna kill him. and i think i know how.
MATTY: it's real, then?
RACINE: yeah, it's real all right, and if we're not careful, it's gonna be the last real thing we do.

RACINE: i know where he is. it's not far from here. i don't want you with me. 
MATTY: i thought we settled that. i'll wait in the car, but -- -- i want to take the risks with you. we're both doing this.

TEDDY: whatsa matter, you can't think with a little music? like this, i said. 
RACINE: that's it?
TEDDY: it's fast. it's hot. it's simple. you can use the clock or rig it to something that moves. it starts big and it'll go with just the mag clips. if you want more, splash a little accelerator around.
RACINE: just regular gasoline?
TEDDY: regular, unleaded, supreme -- whatever you like, counselor. i got to tell you, though, this mama has a big drawback.
RACINE: what?
TEDDY: it's easy to spot, even after the meltdown. they'll know it's arson.
RACINE: i don't care about that. that's all there is to it?
TEDDY: no. no-no-no-no. that ain't all there is to it.

TEDDY: you gotta get in, you gotta get out. you gotta pick the right spot and the right time. and you gotta try not to get famous while you're in the act. if that was all there was to it, any could do it. 
RACINE: sorry.
TEDDY: hey, now i want to ask you something, are you listening, asshole, because i like you? i got a serious question for you. what the are you doing? this is not for you to be messing with. are you ready to hear something? see if this sounds familiar. anytime you try a decent crime, there is fifty ways to up. if you think of twenty-five of them you're a genius. and you're no genius. you know who told me that?
TEDDY: listen, man, maybe you should let me do it for you. gratis. i'll do it. i wouldn't even be on the street if it weren't for you.
RACINE: thanks.
TEDDY: i hope you know what you're doin' you better be pretty sure about it. if you ain't sure, don't do it. of course, that's my recommendation anyway -- don't do it. because i tell you, counselor, this arson, this is serious crime.

MATTY: i don't know why he's so crazy about her. maybe because he never had any of his own. she's a cute little girl, all right, but other than that... i know this, though, her mother has worked plenty hard to keep heather on edmund's mind, always bringing her around, reporting everything she does in school. that roz is a smart one. and you know that anything heather inherits goes straight to roz. heather won't even get a look at it. that's the part i can't stand. that's why it seems so wrong to have half of it go to her. 
RACINE: that's the way it is. there's nothing we can do about it.
MATTY: are you sure, ned? i've been thinking about it. maybe there is. the will is with his lawyer in miami i know that. what if i could get him to bring it home? he did it once, he'd do it again. if i could swing it, couldn't we rewrite it? change it. then when he dies, i could find the new one. we could just change it a little. every little change would mean a lot to us, end. you're a lawyer. you know how to write it. it wouldn't seem so odd. i could say he brought it home and we talked about it and decided to make some changes up here. and i knew you already -- racine is shaking his head.
RACINE: no. forget it.
MATTY: i just don't see why heather should take half --
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 55.
RACINE: listen to me, matty. nothing strange can happen in his life right now, not one thing out of the ordinary. that's vital, that's the main thing. if anything does, the chances double that we get caught. you and i are walking out there on the edge every second now. one false move and we're gonna fall off. it'll be all over. you've got to remember that all the time. you'll get half of everything and it'll be plenty. no matter what it is, we're gonna be satisfied. we're not gonna get greedy. if we do, we'll get burned. you gotta believe me, baby, the odds that we'll get burned are good enough without looking for trouble.
MATTY: you're right, darling. i'm sorry.

RACINE: okay. gotta go. 
MATTY: be careful.
RACINE: i'm just going for a ride. i wish it was all this dangerous.
MATTY: i love you.

RACINE: and? 
MATTY: the side door.
RACINE: and?
MATTY: two a.m. i send him down.
RACINE: we won't talk again after i leave here tonight. i'll be in miami by noon friday. you won't be able to reach me. when i see you again, he'll be dead.
MATTY: i'm so frightened.

WALKER: hello, sweetheart. have i got a nice present for you. 
HEATHER: hi, aunt matty!

MATTY: heather. what a surprise.

WALKER: take it easy. i thought i was tense. 
MATTY: what are you doing?

WALKER: what is it?
MATTY: put on a robe or something. what if heather wakes up and comes down.
WALKER: she's not going to wake up at 2 o'clock in the morning... racine and matty lock eyes. racine slips back through the alcove door.

WALKER: you don't really mind, do you? roz will pick her up on friday. and don't worry, roz won't stay overnight. 
MATTY: she can do whatever she wants.
WALKER: listen, i don't know if i'll be able to come up next weekend. i'll know more later. i'll call you. he gives her a once-over, proprietary look and drives away, honking once to heather, who waves.

MATTY: my you scared me. you shouldn't be here. heather's still here.

RACINE: yeah? 
MATTY: it is me.
RACINE: it's open.
MATTY: why haven't you answered your phone?
RACINE: you took a chance coming here.
MATTY: he's not coming up this weekend.
RACINE: i didn't want to talk. i just wanted to think.

MATTY: can i get in with you?
MATTY: i don't know what heather will tell roz. maybe nothing. maybe she'll be embarrassed or afraid. maybe she'll think she imagined the whole thing.
RACINE: maybe we all did.
MATTY: we'll know if she does tell. roz will report to edmund quick enough. it's exactly what she's always wanted.
MATTY: i've been thinking, too.
RACINE: and what have you got?
MATTY: i think we should give it up. we haven't done anything criminal, yet.
RACINE: it's not too late to back out.
MATTY: that's right. i don't think we can do it.
RACINE: what do you mean?
MATTY: things have already started to go wrong. i feel like we got to the edge and looked over and, well, it was too much. we'll just have to live with that.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 67. she sits down on the bed.
MATTY: i'll divorce him. and we won't have his money. part of me wants it so bad. i'd be lying if i said i didn't. but it's the worst part of me, the weakest part.
MATTY: all that matters is that we're together.
RACINE: you don't think i can pull it off.
MATTY: it's not you, it's us. i'm sure i'll make some mistake.
RACINE: that's not what you really mean, is it, matty?
MATTY: yes it is.
RACINE: no, it isn't. you think he's too much for me. you think i'll it up, get us caught.
MATTY: no, darling. don't talk that way. it's not true.
RACINE: no? well that's what i've been thinking.
MATTY: you're wrong. don't think that, ever! i know you could do it. but all i care about is you. the money doesn't matter.

RACINE: who is he?
BEVERLY: she says he's a lawyer from miami.
RACINE: hello.
SECRETARY: mr. ned racine?
RACINE: yes.
SECRETARY: miles hardin calling.
HARDIN: mr. racine.
RACINE: yes.
HARDIN: this is miles hardin of morris and dale in miami.
RACINE: yes.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 78.
HARDIN: as you know, we represented edmund walker.
RACINE: yes.
HARDIN: yes, well, mrs. walker has submitted the new will you wrote up there.
RACINE: yes... i see.
HARDIN: and frankly, mr. racine, i think we may have a problem.
RACINE: uh-huh. what problem is that?
HARDIN: well, i'd rather discuss it in person. in fact i think it might be best if we could all get together down there.
RACINE: no no, that would be all right.
HARDIN: good. we have a relationship with a firm in west palm -- shiller, hastings.
RACINE: i know of them.
HARDIN: i've arranged to have the use of their offices. i thought we might try to make it tomorrow, say ten o'clock. would that be possible for you?
RACINE: yes, i think so.
HARDIN: good. mrs. walker told me she would be back down there by then.

HARDIN: and i've asked mrs. kraft, mr. walker's sister, to join us, also. 
RACINE: right.
HARDIN: good-bye.
RACINE: will you get me mrs. edmund walker, please.
BEVERLY: i don't have her. should i?
RACINE: i thought the temporary put her in. she came in while you were on vacation. look it up. they were in pinehaven, i think.

BEVERLY: i get no answer at the pinehaven number. 
RACINE: okay. try again later.

HARDIN: miles hardin, mr. racine. 
RACINE: how are you?
HARDIN: i don't think you know mrs. kraft.
RACINE: no. i don't. my condolences.
ROZ: thank you.
RACINE: mrs. walker, i'm very sorry about your husband.
MATTY: thank you, mr. racine.
HARDIN: you know mr. lowenstein.
RACINE: hello, peter.
LOWENSTEIN: hi, ned.
HARDIN: i asked mr. lowenstein to join us because he's handling the inquiry into edmund's death for the county prosecutor's office. he and i have discussed this matter and he's made is possible for us to speak very frankly here today. off the record, so to speak.

HARDIN: as i've told mrs. walker, i was more than a little surprised by the existence of this new will. edmund hadn't mentioned anything about it to me. hardin looks at racine a beat, but racine has nothing to say. 
HARDIN: mrs. walker explained to me that when she and her husband decided to make some minor changes, they just took care of it up here for simplicity's sake. and, indeed, as you know, the new will is almost identical to the old but for the disposition of a few items. at the risk of oversimplifying, the thrust of the will is to divide the estate in almost equal parts between heather kraft and mrs. walker. would you agree with that assessment, mr. racine?
HARDIN: mmmm. and you witnessed the signing by edmund walker along with this miss -- -- mary ann simpson on july twenty- first. apparently, it will be impossible for us to contact miss simpson.
MATTY: mary ann is a lifelong friend of mine. she happened to be visiting on her way to europe. i'm sure when she returns she'll get in touch with me.
RACINE: although it's certainly not required. the witnesses to the signing of a will are not commonly available when the will is entered into probate. it's not standard by any means.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 82.
HARDIN: edmund walker's death was not standard.
ROZ: pardon me. i'm sorry. i'm confused. is there some question about the authenticity of the will? racine would like to kiss roz; instead he turns with a questioning look to hardin.
RACINE: i'm confused, too. do you have a problem with the witnessing or the signatures? what is it you're getting at?
HARDIN: no, there doesn't seem to be any problem here. this is edmund walker's last will and testament. i'm afraid the problem is elsewhere.
HARDIN: would anyone mind if i smoked?
LOWENSTEIN: i don't need my own. i'll just breathe the air.

HARDIN: in writing the will, i'm afraid mr. racine violated what's known as "the rule against perpetuities. 
HARDIN: it's a small thing, but it's the law. it forbids an inheritance to be passed down indefinitely for generations. many general practitioner lawyers don't fully understand it. it doesn't come up much for them, because wills this complex are usually handled by estate departments in larger firms. handled by lawyers who specialize in this type of work.
HARDIN: i know this is terribly confusing, but if you'll bear with me... i spotted the problem right away, but since edmund's intent was clear, i thought it in everyone's best interest to try and get the will admitted into probate anyway, even though it was technically incorrect. i knew that a probate judge in miami would spot the mistake right away. that's all they do all day, they're expert. so i thought i'd bring it up here to okeelanta county -- since edmund had the residence here -- and see if i could get lucky with a judge who didn't know estate law quite so well... perhaps find one with the same kind of training as mr. racine.
HARDIN: unfortunately, my plan backfired. i ran into a judge who'd had other dealings with mr. racine. a judge costanza.

HARDIN: in fact, it seems there were problems with an estate in a case four years ago. very different problems, it's true. but on a will mr. racine prepared. it was quite a mess. accusations of carelessness, a malpractice suit... i think he called it the gourson case? 
ROZ: once again, mr. hardin, you've lost me.
MATTY: yes, what does all this mean?
HARDIN: it means, i'm afraid, that edmund's will is invalid. edmund walker died interstate, as though there were no will at all.
MATTY: so... what happens now?
HARDIN: you don't know?
MATTY: no, i don't.
HARDIN: perhaps mr. racine would like to tell you.
RACINE: in the state of florida, when a person dies without a will, and there are no children and no surviving parents, then the spouse inherits everything.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 85.
MATTY: my you mean... it's all mine?
HARDIN: though that was clearly not your husband's intention.
MATTY: my
HARDIN: he intended heather to benefit --
MATTY: of course, of course, i understand.
HARDIN: as you can imagine, mrs. walkers given the circumstances of edmund's death, none of this is going to happen... how should i say it... simply.
MATTY: ... of course...

RACINE: you look good in black. 
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 86.
MATTY: i've missed you so badly. i need you.
RACINE: at first i couldn't figure out when you got ahold of my stationery and stuff. it finally came to me... edmund's signature must have been a snap. and you knew i wasn't gonna challenge mine --
MATTY: please stop. i don't blame you for hating me right now.
RACINE: you've really done it, matty. you really have.
MATTY: will you come to the house tonight?
MATTY: i want you more right now than i ever have. i know how you must feel about me. but please come tonight.
RACINE: i hope you haven't done us in. matty gets into her car.

RACINE: hi, guys. just come on in, make yourself at home. 
GRACE: sorry about that.
LOWENSTEIN: not me. the door was unlocked, inviting illegal entry. it's behavior like that makes oscar's job so hard.
RACINE: sorry, oscar. would you guys a beer?
LOWENSTEIN: no thanks, i already had one.
GRACE: i've gotta bring my wife up here. she thinks our house is the hottest place in the county.
RACINE: it ain't great this time of day.
GRACE: ned, how did you get involved with this matty walker?
RACINE: what do you mean?
GRACE: i mean she's poison, man. tell me what you know about her old man's death.
RACINE: what read in the paper. he died in the fire. looks like arson--
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 88.
LOWENSTEIN: was arson.
RACINE: okay, was arson. you don't know if he was setting it and messed up... or if that's just what someone wanted it to look like.
GRACE: nah, he didn't set it. somebody offend him.
RACINE: his people owned the place or something?
GRACE: that's right. a very rough group of fellows, too. they're arguing with the insurance company right now. it's possible they wanted to cut old edmund out. i'm sure they're not too broken up over his departure. but this just doesn't seem like a neat way to handle something like that.
LOWENSTEIN: it's not their style. they're very smooth. they'd rather destroy you than kill you. and they hate publicity.
GRACE: course guys like that make a lot of enemies. coulda been a grudge match from the outside, i suppose. but me, i'm kinda interested in the grieving widow.
LOWENSTEIN: her sister-in-law's got plenty of ideas along that line, too. she could barely contain herself today, i could tell. but she wants to wait and see how matty treats her on the estate. she doesn't want to blow it.
LOWENSTEIN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 89.
GRACE: how'd you get involved?
RACINE: they asked me to re-do the will. i met with her and edmund. it was pretty simple. this mary ann simpson witnessed it with me. walker didn't seem to think it was any big deal.
GRACE: that's it?
RACINE: that's it.
GRACE: what was this simpson's story?
RACINE: i don't know... old friend of theirs, good-looking broad. she was just passing through.
GRACE: on her way to europe?
GRACE: the passport people can't find any record of that. lowenstein and grace look at him a long time.
GRACE: what do you think? about the wife?
RACINE: i suppose it's possible. i don't know much about her, except -- -- what i've seen. wouldn't shock me, either way.
LOWENSTEIN: i've got a feeling she's very bad news. take some incredibly intelligent advice and stay away from her.
GRACE: he's right for once.
GRACE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 90.
RACINE: well, i'm sorry, guys. i'm afraid i can't do that.
GRACE: why not?
RACINE: first of all, did you get a look at her?
RACINE: that wouldn't be quite so meaningful, except that today she started coming on to me. and maybe you haven't heard but the lady is about to come into a great deal of money.
RACINE: the fact is, she's invited me out to her place tonight. and i'm going. and i'll keep on going as many nights, or days, or weekends, as she'll have me.
LOWENSTEIN: ned, that lady may have just killed her husband.
RACINE: peter, she's not gonna inherit anything by killing me.
GRACE: ned, you've messed up before. you'll mess up again. that's your nature. but they've always been small-time. this might not be. she's trouble, ned. the real thing. big-time, major league trouble. watch yourself.
GRACE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 91.

MATTY: i know. i know. i know you'd probably like to kill me. i know. but please... you can hate me... punish me... hurt me if you want, but don't talk yet. 
MATTY: please, ned.
MATTY: ... mary ann and i left wheaton together and went to chicago. we didn't know what we were doing. i got in bad trouble with drugs. speed. really bad. i did things... whatever's the evilest thing you can think of me now, i did worse things then. there's nothing lower than the animal i was then. worse than you can imagine. i thought i would die. i prayed i would... and then a man helped me. he got me clean. he didn't want much in return, either... he was a lawyer and he put me to work in his office. i learned a lot there. one time i even thought i might go to law school. ... that's where i picked up the business about making a will invalid. that happened to him once. i swear i would never have used that if i'd known about your case... i was afraid to tell you, ned. i knew you wouldn't let me do it. i'm greedy, like you said. i wanted us to have it all.
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 92.
MATTY: i don't blame you for thinking i'm bad. i am. i know it. i'd understand if you just cut me off now. if you never trusted me again. you'd probably be smart. but you must believe one thing. i love you. i love you and need you. i want to be with you forever.
RACINE: they already think you're involved.
MATTY: i don't care.
RACINE: great.
MATTY: there's nothing we can do about it now. in a little while we'll either have the money or we won't. it's out of our hands.
MATTY: i fired the housekeeper. we can stay together as long as we want.

RACINE: i've been down there a lot lately. isn't that amazing? miami. i'm handling the purchase of some property down there. i'll be going back in the future... if that's all right, if it's still legal to go to miami. 
LOWENSTEIN: he is mad.
RACINE: nooo. no, i'm not mad. why should i be mad just because my friend here, who i've know for years, wants to know of my whereabouts on the night of our recent local murder?
LOWENSTEIN: it's not so recent anymore. maybe he's feeling some pressure.
GRACE: you brought this on yourself, man! i don't run this department, you know. there are people watching this thing. they hear you're out there banging the widow every night; it tends to call attention to you. so don't give me
RACINE: that's my business!
GRACE: this whole case is getting crazy.
LOWENSTEIN: did you tell him about the glasses?
LOWENSTEIN: seems walker always ware glasses -- steel-rimmed glasses. he was a real fanatic about them.
LOWENSTEIN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 94.
LOWENSTEIN: but there were none on the scene. coroner says they should've been there. he says that even after the fire the frames should've been seared into his -- well, you don't want to hear the details.
RACINE: so what?
GRACE: so it's looking more and more like he was killed somewhere else and brought there in his own car. your honey, his wife, says he left the house in the middle of the night driving himself to some mysterious meeting. is that vague enough for you?
RACINE: look, what is this? what do you want? am i supposed to be an undercover agent for you guys, or something?
LOWENSTEIN: interesting choice of phrase.
RACINE: how 'bout tonight i ask her? 'say, did you kill your husband? my friends were just wondering...'
LOWENSTEIN: hey, that's an idea. ask her where the glasses are, where she did it...
OSCAR: just one thing.
LOWENSTEIN: oh, yeah! right, right. you'll love this, ned, this latest development. maybe you'll be able to work up a little sympathy for us, see why oscar here has a tendency to get carried away. tell him, oscar.
LOWENSTEIN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 95.
OSCAR: this is from the sister-in-law, the kraft woman. she's been driving me batty lately. she's convinced she ain't gonna be out into the will. it seems that a couple weeks before the murder, walker's niece stayed up there for a while with your friend matty. one night she waxes up, goes to see her aunt and catches the lady with some guy.
LOWENSTEIN: do you get it? in the act or some thing!
GRACE: we haven't got all the details yet. mrs. kraft is bringing the little girl up here today to tell us her story.
LOWENSTEIN: oh, they're here. i ran into them on the way in. they're waiting outside.
GRACE: christ. i'm not sure i'm up to dealing with this scene.
GRACE: listen, you probably don't want to see the kraft woman right now. she's a little wild. why don't you slip out the back way here?
RACINE: are we done here?
GRACE: i've got it all here. and, ned, i'm sorry i had to ask.

HEATHER: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 97.
RACINE: goodbye.
ROZ: goodbye.

STELLA: hi, racine. how you doing today? 
RACINE: i'm fine, stella. i'm fine. what's the latest? any hot news?
STELLA: nothing much doing. what'll it be?
RACINE: what's the special?
STELLA: veal outlets.
RACINE: what day'd you cook 'em?
STELLA: they're fresh this month.

LOWENSTEIN: the usual, my sweet. 
STELLA: two ice teas for fred astaire.
LOWENSTEIN: are you ready to hear something wild?
RACINE: i don't know. i may have had my share for the day.
LOWENSTEIN: no, this is right up your alley.
LOWENSTEIN: little heather comes out onto the back porch, and this dude is out there with her aunt, see? and he's turned away with his pants or shorts or whatever dropped, so he's mooning the little girl, right. and he and your friend are going at something which heather couldn't quite figure out.
LOWENSTEIN: poor little heather! she's never seen one angry before. but it made quite an impression on her. yessirree! that's all she can remember.
RACINE: that's it?
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 99.
LOWENSTEIN: one other thing. she says the guy's hair was greasy. he wore it slicked back. "like a cuban," she says. i loved that! can you imagine poor heather? she hustled back to bed after getting a gander at that. and listen to why she got up in the first place, this is the capper. she had a nightmare! christ, can you imagine what kinds of dreams she had the rest of the night?

RACINE: don't say that. don't say you don't have them. 
MATTY: i swear to you, i don't. what's wrong with you?
RACINE: they had to be here when you cleaned up that night. think about it, think hard. they've probably got my prints on them.
MATTY: i must have missed them. i wasn't looking for them. i thought they were on edmund.
RACINE: so where could they have gone?
MATTY: i don't know. betty!
RACINE: the housekeeper? where would she have put them? you've been through his things.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 100.
MATTY: she might have taken them.
MATTY: listen to me. that's why i fired her. after edmund's death she started acting strange. she was always watching me, listening to my calls.
RACINE: that's crazy. you imagined it. i know, i've been imagining things, too. plenty.
MATTY: no, ned, not with her i wasn't. i could tell there was a difference. maybe she know about us. maybe she wants something.
RACINE: don't you think we would have heard from her by now?
MATTY: i don't know what to think. i'm worried. but it's not about the glasses. or your friends. it's us.
RACINE: i'm sorry.
MATTY: your first reaction is to accuse me. what's happening to you? i don't know if we can hold on like this.
MATTY: hardin called today. he said everything should be cleared up by next week. i'll get the money he apologized for the delay.
RACINE: they've been stalling. they're draggin it out, hoping they'd come up with some way to implicate you.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 101.
MATTY: but they haven't been able to. soon it'll be all ours. that's why we've got to hold together, ned. it won't be long, then we'll get away from here. out from under all this. all we have is each other. i'd kill myself if i thought this thing would destroy us. i couldn't take it.

RACINE: peter? 
LOWENSTEIN: hi, ned.
RACINE: what are you doing here?
LOWENSTEIN: i've been looking for you.
RACINE: yeah?
LOWENSTEIN: yeah. you always run this late?
RACINE: nah. i'm going to miami tomorrow.
LOWENSTEIN: what's in miami?
RACINE: i'm closing this real estate deal i've been working on.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 103.
LOWENSTEIN: you're some kind of health nut. matty walker smokes that same brand.
RACINE: is this gonna be one of those conversations? maybe i should have my lawyer present.
LOWENSTEIN: buddy, your lawyer is present.
LOWENSTEIN: you know, that edmund walker was a bad guy. the more i find out about him, the happier i am he's dead. i figure it's a positive thing for the world.
RACINE: you're not known for being a hardliner.
LOWENSTEIN: mmm. i have my own standards. i try to keep them private. as far as i'm concerned, i don't care who killed him. and i don't care who gets rich because of it. but oscar, oscar's not like that. his whole life is based on doing the right thing. he's the only person i know like that. sometimes it's a real pain in the ass. even for him.
LOWENSTEIN: oscar's unhappy right now. he's in pain.
RACINE: why is that?
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 104.
LOWENSTEIN: because he likes you. he likes you even better than i do. that's why he's been busting his trying to locate this mary ann simpson. they finally found her place in miami yesterday, but the woman herself was gone... looked like she left in a hurry. oscar thought any story she could tell might help you. he thinks you need help.
LOWENSTEIN: someone's putting you in deep trouble, my friend. from about three thirty to five am on the night walker was killed, someone called your hotel room repeatedly. the hotel didn't want to put them through, but whoever was calling convinced them it was an emergency. the phone rang and rang, but you didn't answer.
LOWENSTEIN: don't say anything. save it for some other time. it gets worse. now someone's trying to give us edmund's glasses. we don't know who. we don't know what the glasses will tell us. but our negotiations are continuing.
LOWENSTEIN: i wish i knew what to tell you, ned. but i don't have any good ideas.
LOWENSTEIN: i'll see ya.

GLENN: we know each other, don't we? i'm michael glenn. with bashford, hillerman. 
RACINE: ned racine.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 106.
GLENN: christ, i've done it again. i'm just meeting some people.
GLENN: hey, this is silly. you're not still mad about that gourson business? we had to do it. costanza practically insisted we sue you. listen, nobody at our place likes malpractice against other lawyers.
RACINE: forget it.
GLENN: i tried to make it up to you.
GLENN: did you ever meet a lady named matty walker? you'd remember her. a very hot number.
RACINE: matty walker?
GLENN: yeah. i met her at a party. she said she was going up there and she wanted to know about lawyers. i gave her your name.
RACINE: when was this?
GLENN: i don't know... long time. maybe september.
GLENN: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 107.
GLENN: oops, gotta go.
RACINE: did you tell her about the gourson case?
RACINE: did you tell her about gourson?
GLENN: are you nuts?
GLENN: maybe i told her how we met. yeah, maybe.

BEVERLY: is there something wrong with your phone? 
RACINE: just off the hook. what?
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 108.
BEVERLY: teddy laursen is in county. he's very anxious to talk to you. he sounded bad.
BEVERLY: hey, are you all right?

TEDDY: i don't know. it's a thing in lauderdale. something must've gone wrong, but they're not telling me. 
RACINE: i'll find out.
TEDDY: no, no. that's not why i called you. in fact, i got me another lawyer.
TEDDY: i think it would be better. you know schlisgal.
RACINE: he's good.
TEDDY: this broad came to me last week. a real looker. she said you told her how to reach me, i figured you musta, she knew all about it. she said you wanted another one.
TEDDY: yeah, i was afraid of that. but i'm a slow thinker.

TEDDY: she had me show her how to rig it to a door, with a little delay. does any of this mean anything to you? 
TEDDY: then i'm glad i told you. watch your step.
RACINE: thanks, teddy.
TEDDY: racine... don't thank me yet. these guys here, they've been asking me about the breakers. i haven't told 'em but i don't like the look on their faces.

BEVERLY: ned. it's mrs. walker. do you want her? 
RACINE: yeah. hello.
MATTY: hello, ned. can we talk?
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 110.
RACINE: okay. where are you?
MATTY: i'm in miami. i've been running around like crazy and i could reach you before i left. ned, everything's going to be all right.
RACINE: tell me.
MATTY: i've got the money. i've taken it and sent it somewhere safe. it's all ours now. but that's not the best part.
RACINE: what's the best part?
MATTY: the glasses. i got them back. that is, they should be ours by now. betty had them. she wanted money. that's why i had to come down here. she made it all very difficult, but i think it worked out.
RACINE: do you have them?
MATTY: no. she wouldn't do that. she's putting them in the boathouse. in the top drawer of the dresser in the boathouse. they should be there now, if she's kept up her end.
RACINE: yes.
MATTY: i think you'd better get them right away. i don't trust her.
RACINE: in the boathouse.
MATTY: that's right. the top drawer of the dresser. oh. ned, we're going to be all right. i'll leave here as soon

MATTY: as i can. i should be there by seven- thirty. i can't wait to see you, darling. we've made it. 
MATTY: are you all right?
RACINE: yes.
MATTY: good-bye, sweetheart.

GRACE: teddy, this is detective knapp from the fort lauderdale arson squad. he's brought some very bad news about that fire. seems there were two people who didn't get out. 
GRACE: i know, teddy. it's not like you. and i'm willing to make that clear to anybody who'll listen. but you're going to have to help me out on this breakers business.

LOWENSTEIN: stupid. that's always been the problem. her mind encompasses his. 
GRACE: i better go get him.

MATTY: hello, darling. 
RACINE: hello, matty.
MATTY: where's your car?
RACINE: in the back. with yours.
MATTY: why haven't you turned on the lights?
RACINE: i could see.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 114.
MATTY: it's all ours now, ned. we could leave tonight if we wanted. it's over.
RACINE: yes, it is.
MATTY: what's this --?
RACINE: it's edmund's gun. you remember it, don't you?
MATTY: what is it, ned? what's happened?
RACINE: i think you know.
MATTY: no. i swear to you, i don't!
RACINE: it's the glasses, matty.
MATTY: weren't they there? didn't she bring them?
RACINE: i didn't see them.
MATTY: she promised she'd bring them.
RACINE: maybe i missed them. the way you missed them that night.
MATTY: ned, i don't know what you think, but you're wrong. i haven't done anything to hurt you. i love you.
RACINE: keep talking, matty. experience shows i can be convinced of anything.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 115.

MATTY: i did arrange to meet you. but, ned, it all changed. you changed it. i fell in love with you. i didn't plan that... 
RACINE: you never quit, do you? you just keep on coming.
MATTY: how can i prove it to you? what can i say?
RACINE: the glasses, matty. why don't you go down there and get them?
MATTY: but you said they weren't there.
RACINE: i said i didn't see them.

MATTY: i'll go, ned. i'll go and look for them. 
MATTY: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 116.
MATTY: ned... no matter what you think, i do love you.

RACINE: but what if that was someone else's body in there? what if it was already there when i got there -- dead and waiting for me. maybe her friend... 
GRACE: her teeth were left, man. we sent them back to illinois. the identification was positive. that was her, that was matty tyler walker.
RACINE: you're not listening to me. what if she's been using this other girl's name? since she met walker three years ago, since she first spotted him and decided to take him... one way or another. maybe walker -- or any of us -- never knew her real name.
GRACE: why would she want to hide her identity?
RACINE: i don't know. maybe there was something in her past, something so bad she was afraid it would queer it with walker if he found out -- that he'd never marry her.
RACINE: let's say she's living as the other girl, this girl from her past. someone whose history she knew and could use any way she wanted. and there's only one person in the world who knows the truth.

RACINE: and then just when matty's got me on the line, when she's finally going to collect, that one person shows up. that girl. finds her. and threatens to expose her. so matty starts paying her off. maybe she even promises to cut her in on edmunds' money. now she's got to share it with two people. racine peaks, tapping the glass between them as though it were all there for grace to see. 
RACINE: but when matty sees a way to get rid of both of them at once. a way to solve all her problems and get clear, with no one looking for her. at the boathouse. you find two bodies, me and this girl. two killers dead. case closed.
RACINE: you can't find the money, can you, oscar? doesn't that tell you something?
GRACE: it tells me she moved it and we can't find it. and that don't mean it could be sittin' in any bank in the world waiting for a dead lady to come for it.
GRACE: do you hear what you're saying? it's crazy. this matty would've had to been one quick, smart broad.
RACINE: oscar, don't you understand? that was her special gift she was relentless. matty was the kind of person who could do what was necessary. whatever was necessary.
RACINE: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 119.
GRACE: racine, you got to face something. you killed edmund walker, man. and you're going down for it. two people are dead. and no matter how you want to figure it, you ain't bringin' either of 'em back to life.
