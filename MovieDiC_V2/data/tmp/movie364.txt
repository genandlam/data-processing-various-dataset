speaker2: the others are going into kampala.

speaker1: that ain't my speed no more. i wanna see some country. 
speaker2: you want to see?

speaker1: they always drive this fast? 
speaker2: traveling is the most dangerous time in sudan. if the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad.
speaker1: you got kids, deng?
speaker2: no. i have no children.
speaker1: where you from?
speaker2: a little village called aweil. many hours from here.
speaker1: that's where your family is?
speaker2: my family was killed by lra.
speaker2: unyama is about two hours from here. we will stop there for lunch.

speaker1: the muslim north has tried to kill the christian south for 30 years. two million have lost their lives... 
speaker1: ... these people have been driven from their villages, however these camps are not much better...

speaker1: deng turns to sam... 
speaker2: i'm sorry, sam... i'll be five minutes.
speaker3: course, do what you gotta do.
speaker4: excuse me. you. can you help please?
speaker4: we need to transfer her to the bed. get her shoulders...
speaker4: one, two, three...
speaker3: what happened to her face?
speaker4: the rebels cut off her lips because she argued. these are kony's orders.
speaker3: who's kony?
speaker4: who are you with?
speaker3: i'm with deng over there.

speaker1: what organization are you with? 
speaker2: working with a christian group down south. just up here takin a look around, seein a bit of the country.
speaker1: this isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone. you stay in this area, you'll be killed.
speaker1: thank you for your help.

speaker1: some say joseph kony is a wizard. a shapeshifter. he calls himself a christian... 
speaker1: ... but i say he is satan, who devours his own people.
speaker2: kony is the leader of the lra?
speaker1: he is the one we have been fighting for years. but there is very little we can do. our weapons are old, and our boots are full of holes. we have been forgotten by the rest of the world.

speaker1: why are you here? 
speaker2: s'cuse me?
speaker1: what are you looking for in this place?
speaker2: ain't lookin for nuthin.
speaker1: and then you will get your picture and go back to your life and all this will just be a story you tell your friends.

speaker1: they are night commuters. they come from deep in the bush. their parents send them out because it is safer to sleep here than in their own homes. 
speaker2: why?
speaker1: because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps.
speaker1: these are the lucky one so far. the ones the rebels have not found. the invisible children.

speaker1: where are you going? 
speaker1: sam...

speaker1: get up... let's go... 
speaker1: come on...
speaker2: what are you doing?
speaker1: they ain't sleepin out here. tell em they're comin inside. ya'll get up... let's go...
speaker2: sam, there are too many...
speaker2: ... you can't help them all.
speaker1: i can help these here.

speaker1: the lra attacked a village last night. 
speaker1: you said you wanted to see.

speaker1: you see any tigers over there? 
speaker2: naw, didn't see no tigers.
speaker1: but they do have them over in africa.

speaker4: daddy, i'm gonna go.
speaker3: ok, sweetie...
speaker3: goddamn, they grow up quick, don't they?
speaker2: sure do.
speaker3: hey, nuthin fer nuthin, sam, but rumor has it you was puttin up a chapel over there in central city.
speaker2: that's right. gonna minister to anybody who's lookin for the lord.
speaker3: that's good, man. maybe you can do somethin bout your old friend, donnie.
speaker2: what about em?
speaker3: he ain't doin so good, bro. but hey, good seein ya' man.

speaker1: i can't do this. 
speaker2: look at me. don't make trash, boy. now he ain't givin up on you, so don't give up on him, you hear me?

speaker1: it's five-til and he still ain't here. 
speaker2: you call him?
speaker2: try him again.
speaker3: you like this dress, sam?
speaker2: what, mom?

speaker1: you ain't never seen this one. i bought it a long time ago. been keepin it for a special occasion. 
speaker2: it's nice.
speaker1: i never told you this but when i was pregnant with you, now this was way back, probably 1960, when yer daddy and i was still in grand rapids, a pastor prophesied over me. pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me i was gonna have a preacher for a son. yer daddy and i were so proud. i remember we went home and neither of us could sleep all night. just laid there and talked bout you, bout what was comin.
speaker2: i just built a church. i ain't no preacher.
speaker1: yes you are. you were born to it. just took you a little ways to get here.

speaker1: the guest preacher we had booked today ain't shown up... so i thought i'd say a word or two. 
speaker1: lotta yous been wonderin what made me wanna build this here church. seein as i ain't the best seed in the bunch i can understand that.
speaker1: buncha years ago i was runnin from some bad fellas in the woods over there by cleary. those old boys was comin after me hard and i reached in my bag lookin for my old shotgun but it was gone. my momma had took it out when i wasn't lookin and put this bible in there instead...
speaker1: well i figured i was done for, so i sat down under an old tree with this useless book and i waited...
speaker1: ... and then the strangest thing happened. them boys ran right on past me. didn't even see me sittin there. now the way i figure it, things would have turned out pretty different if i had pulled out that shotgun instead of this here bible. and that's probably the first time i can remember savin my
speaker1: and my momma.
speaker1: figure least i could do was build em both this church.

speaker1: be back soon as i can. 
speaker2: you're gonna miss my play.
speaker1: have momma videotape it for me, k? now i gotta git.
speaker3: call us when you can.
speaker1: i will.
speaker1: you watch out for em while i'm gone, ya hear?
speaker4: that's done, buddy.

speaker1: sam, wait... 
speaker1: it is not safe here.
speaker2: this is it...

speaker1: this is not a good idea. 
speaker2: i think it's a heckuva good idea.
speaker1: it would be better further south. closer to kampala.
speaker2: if i wanted to be closer to kampala, i'd be closer to kampala. i wanna be right here...

speaker1: he should not be this far north. 
speaker2: what are you sayin?
speaker1: the villages in this area are very remote, mr. childers. there is nothing there.
speaker2: then it seems to me them people need help the most.
speaker1: he will be killed.
speaker2: talk to me.
speaker1: this is in the war zone, mr. childers.
speaker2: i don't think you understand me, so lemme make it real clear to ya. i didn't pick this land -- did.

speaker1: good to meet you betty. 
speaker2: she is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage.
speaker1: i'm lookin for somebody who can keep the place in order. make sure things is taken care of when i'm away.
speaker2: she can do this.
speaker1: she's gonna have to take care of the children too, make sure they're fed, fix em when they're sick. can she do that?
speaker3: quiet now.
speaker1: tell her she's hired.

speaker1: you two share a blanket and tomorrow we will find another. 
speaker2: shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes...

speaker1: you know what's funny? in english your name means "darn it." 
speaker2: what is this `darn it?'
speaker1: deng. it means `shucks.' you know, like you stub your toe and you go "ahhhhh, deng!" get it?
speaker2: this is not funny. in my language, in arabic, names are very important. they tell you everything about a man.
speaker1: i'm sorry, buddy. it was just a joke.
speaker1: what does sam mean in arabic?
speaker2: small penis.
speaker1: can i ask you a question?
speaker2: of course.
speaker1: you believe in god? deng considering this for a beat, and then...

speaker2: the acholi people were farmers before they were driven from their ancestral homeland. each year they blessed the soil before a planting.
speaker2: they are saying that fire brings strength and ashes abundance...
speaker2: ... when the land burns, the next year the soil produces more...
speaker3: the children are your fields...
speaker2: ... she says you are a farmer and these children are your crops...

speaker1: ... and this ground will grow them tall. 
speaker2: ... and this ground is richer now and they will grow stronger because of it.

speaker1: can i talk to you about somethin?
speaker2: yep.
speaker1: i'm glad i'm walkin with the lord and all, but sometimes i ain't sure i'm gonna be able to do what he wants me to do.
speaker2: the lord don't ask for nuthin you can't deliver, buddy. and yer one tough ole boy.
speaker1: sometimes i ain't so sure how tough i am.
speaker2: why don't we pray together then...

speaker6: thank you, bill.
speaker5: forget it. now c'mon, can i get ya a mojito or somethin?

speaker1: why we leavin so soon? 
speaker2: everything alright?...
speaker3: get in the car.
speaker4: what's wrong?
speaker3: sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and he's livin in the taj mahal...
speaker4: sam...
speaker3: i asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me? hundred and fifty bucks. that's it. handed it to me like it was gold bouillon! sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party.

speaker1: what are you doin? 
speaker2: i've had it with these people and all their about wantin to help...
speaker1: sam childers...

speaker1: stay outta my way. 
speaker2: ... i'm sorry, twenty-five hundred is the best i can do for them gun.
speaker1: throw in the car for five.

speaker1: sam turns to deng -- 
speaker2: who's this guy?
speaker3: that's our leader.
speaker2: john garang?

speaker1: they call you preacher. is this what i should call you? 
speaker2: sam is fine.
speaker1: i hear what you have done for the spla and i am grateful.
speaker2: we can thank for his blessins.
speaker1: yes, we can. how many children do you look after, sam?
speaker2: couple hundred with us here. feed another thousand a day from nearby villages. anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.
speaker1: what you are doing is noble, but too dangerous. i must advise you to stop risking your life in our struggle.

speaker1: until someone starts fightin for these children, i'm the one that's gonna do it. 
speaker2: you are stubborn, aren't you?
speaker1: as a mule.
speaker2: you and i come from very different worlds, but we are not so dissimilar.
speaker2: i founded the spla in order to fight for the future of sudan because nobody else would. we fight for freedom from the government in khartoum, for the right to vote, and for the right to worship any one may choose.
speaker2: but most important to me is our struggle for the children. their laughter has been lost to this country for far too long.
speaker2: there are peace talks scheduled for the end of august in naivashu. i'd like you to come as my guest.
speaker1: talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time. you gotta go out and make it.
speaker2: you are correct, but we must fight them at every level. part of my battle is waged in those rooms. we must talk of peace, but keep our rifles ready for war.
speaker2: maybe together you and i can make sudan free once again.

speaker1: there is a cost for freedom, sam. a price for the future of these people. some pay with their lives, others pay in different ways. 
speaker1: my only hope is that your cost is not too great.

speaker1: you say prayers or somethin? 
speaker2: already did.
speaker1: ok then, sweet dreams.
speaker2: ain't you gonna read me a book?
speaker1: ahh, paige, you know i don't read so good.
speaker2: then let's play a game.
speaker1: ok.
speaker2: i'm thinkin of a dog.
speaker1: what about it?
speaker2: never mind, donnie.
speaker1: ok.

speaker1: dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves. you can do that. 
speaker2: sure i can.
speaker2: sweet dreams.

speaker1: keep em closed! a little bit more! 
speaker2: keep your eyes closed.
speaker3: michael! cover your eyes! no peeking!
speaker1: ... keep comin'...
speaker1: ok, stop! open your eyes!
speaker2: open your eyes!

speaker1: some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. that kony is offering money for your nose and ears. 
speaker1: i'd like to assign a few more men to you during the day.
speaker2: he ain't the first old-boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall. keep yer soldiers where they're needed. i can take care of myself.
speaker2: he said anything yet?
speaker1: all we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the lra.
speaker2: where's the brother?
speaker1: nobody knows.

speaker1: hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the other kids? william, no response. 
speaker1: you know sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside, know what i mean?
speaker1: you have no idea what i'm sayin, do you?
speaker1: i done a lotta things i ain't proud of. hurt a lotta people. truth is, helpin you kids is about the only good thing i ever done in this life.
speaker1: but i'm scared. scared one day i'll close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem.
speaker1: just like everybody else in this world.

speaker1: i don't see nuthin. 
speaker2: this is it.

speaker1: hold on... 
speaker1: i got em.

speaker1: what's he sayin? 
speaker2: a.j. is dead.
speaker1: 
speaker1: tell him to stay where he is. don't move.
speaker2: don't move!
speaker1: ask him if he saw the shooter.
speaker2: did you see him?!
speaker2: he did not see.
speaker1: you got `em?
speaker2: yes. he's on the ridge... just below that outcropping.
speaker1: can you reach the browning?

speaker1: killed instantly. 
speaker2: i think you got him!

speaker1: sam. 
speaker1: lra wanted us here.

speaker1: everybody ok? 
speaker2: oh yeah, everybody's just fine. i was just callin to say `hey' is all.
speaker1: how're the girls?

speaker1: they're good. paige cooked us all dinner the other night. chocolate-chip pancakes. 
speaker2: by herself, huh?
speaker1: yep. i helped her with the stove is all. she did everything else. pretty good too.
speaker1: how's it goin over there?
speaker2: goin fine.
speaker1: hey, maybe i'll come with you one of these trips. i'd like to get outta here for a spell. see what it's like.
speaker2: sounds good.
speaker1: ask you a question?
speaker3: yeah.
speaker4: you think will forgive us for the things we've done?

speaker1: in the camps. the children. they say there is a white preacher who hunts the lra. this place does not need more killing, mr. childers. 
speaker2: i'm just tryin to help these people. same as you.
speaker1: war upon war does not fix what is broken here. the history of this country is filled with righteous killers. that is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons.
speaker2: i got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food. right or not, that's all the reason i need.
speaker1: and what about the rumors i have heard about you supplying weapons to the spla?
speaker2: you fight the evil in this place your way, i'll fight it mine.
speaker1: do not delude yourself, mr. childers. you're a mercenary, not a humanitarian.
speaker1: they say you are doing good. that you have special powers. that you are protected by angels and cannot be killed by bullets.
speaker1: they said the same thing about kony in the beginning.

speaker1: what's goin on? 
speaker2: an lra convoy has moved north over the border. they're heading for ed duim.
speaker1: that's where they sell em on the black market, ain't it?

speaker1: clear! 
speaker2: bring me a flashlight.

speaker1: what'd he say? 
speaker2: the truck is too damaged to move. we don't have room for them all, preacher.
speaker1: bring our truck up here and shine them lights on us.
speaker1: pull everyone of them kids outta there.
speaker2: bring the children out...
speaker1: put em right here... real easy...
speaker2: put them together here... gently...

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: we're takin the ones that ain't gonna make it through the night. come back for the others later.
speaker2: tell her i'm not gonna hurt her.
speaker1: it's ok... he will not hurt you...
speaker2: put her in the truck.
speaker2: tell em we're comin back.
speaker2: tell em!
speaker1: we will be back for you!

speaker1: let's go! 
speaker2: two hours... i'll be back in two hours...
speaker1: tell em to hide. don't come out til they see my face...
speaker3: hide until we return!

speaker1: sudan? 
speaker1: what are you doing over there?

speaker1: sam! 
speaker2: sorry i'm late. sixteen was all jammed up...
speaker2: welcome home, buddy.

speaker1: i understand what you're saying, but there's just not a lot we can do, until we pay down some of what you owe my hands are tied. 
speaker2: it's just an application for a short term loan.
speaker1: sam, we already took out a second on your home.
speaker2: it's only 90 days.
speaker1: you're completely leveraged.
speaker2: i only got one truck over there, john. i need the money to buy a second vehicle.
speaker2: it's important. now, there's one in kampala i can probably get for twenty- one...
speaker2: i want you to look at this. see that? twelve year old boy had both his arms cut off by lra...
speaker1: sam... it's not necessary.

speaker1: look at this john, when we found this little girl her had been hacked off... bank manager not looking at the photograph... 
speaker2: sam, this isn't necessary...
speaker1: look at her. look at this girl.
speaker1: now i ain't in here askin fer money fer a hot tub or vacation or somethin like that. i'm askin for an extra vehicle so i can save some children. you understand that?
speaker2: i do, but...
speaker1: but nuthin. i need you to open yer little book there and do whatever you need to do to get me that loan...
speaker2: sam, you need to calm down...
speaker1: don't tell me to calm down! look at those pictures! -- look at em, john --

speaker1: ... open yer eyes!... wake up!... 
speaker1: you call yerselves children of but you ain't. ya'll just sheep followin him deaf, and blind...

speaker1: mary strauss and them is havin dinner at the chimney. 
speaker2: who's her date?
speaker3: tony wilks.
speaker2: i thought tony wilkes was goin with patty hobbes' daughter.
speaker1: they broke up last month.
speaker4: ... sudanese opposition leader john garang has been killed in a helicopter crash according to a statement released by the sudanese government in khartoum today.

speaker1: six of garang's associates and seven others also died in the crash which is being blamed on bad weather. 
speaker2: dad? -- dad?
speaker2: what do you think about us gettin a limo for next weekend? wouldn't be too expensive since there'd be six of us. sam lost here for a moment...

speaker2: dad, what you think? can we get a limo?

speaker1: no. 
speaker2: dad. please. patty and them is gettin one.
speaker1: you ain't rentin no limo to pittsburgh.
speaker3: we could probably get us a deal through one of tom hickey's boys. between the six of them it wouldn't cost too much.
speaker1: nobody's spendin money on no friggin limousine.
speaker2: but dad...

speaker1: we're just talkin bout it, honey... 
speaker2: too much talk in this house. i got mouths to feed and you're talkin bout money away on a limo.
speaker3: it's my formal, dad.
speaker2: i don't give a what it is! you ain't gettin no limo, end of story.
speaker3: you love them black babies more than you love me.

speaker1: sam... 
speaker2: hey...
speaker3: what the you think you're doin, boy?

speaker1: you sold the business for $27,000?
speaker2: i need a new truck for the orphanage.
speaker1: a new truck? you sold our business for a new truck? sam finds the keys.
speaker1: that was our future, sam. paige's future. lynn follows sam into the office.

speaker2: what's the combination? what's the combination.
speaker1: paige's birthday.
speaker1: you don't know it, do you? you don't even remember your own daughter's birthday.

speaker1: you take that and we lose the house. the church. all of it.
speaker2: you can make it up with the ministry.
speaker1: what ministry?! they see what you've become, sam. they see how far gone you are. you need to get quiet with the lord.
speaker2: the lord.
speaker1: don't say that. don't turn yer back on him.
speaker2: ... he turned his back on me! -- on donnie! -- on every one of them kids over there.
speaker1: the good you're doin is destroyin this family.

speaker1: what good have i ever done? 
speaker2: please don't leave...

speaker1: it's ok -- we are a relief convoy -- 
speaker1: we have only medical supplies -- non-

speaker1: we are only a relief convoy -- 
speaker2: shut your mouth!

speaker1: i want to ask you something... 
speaker1: this is my brother. his name is christopher. he was stolen by the rebels.
speaker1: do you know if he is alive?

speaker1: were you taken when you were young like me? 
speaker1: do you remember your parents?

speaker1: do you hear that, preacher? 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: there is no more laughter. the children do not play here anymore. they are scared once again.
speaker1: but now they are scared of you.
speaker1: the men do not trust you any longer to lead them into battle. they say you have a wish to die.
speaker1: i am worried about my friend. i want to help him.
speaker2: i don't need your help.

speaker1: i remember my parents when i sleep. i see them in my dreams sometimes. 
speaker1: my father was big like you. they shot him. we were so scared. then the rebels gave me a club and told me if i didn't kill my mother they would shoot my brother and me.
speaker1: i refused, but my mother told me to swing hard... that i must make her proud...
speaker1: and so i did. i made her proud.
speaker1: if we allow ourselves to become full of hate then they've won. we must not let them take our hearts. this is the most important thing.

speaker1: hello? 
speaker2: bug? you there?
