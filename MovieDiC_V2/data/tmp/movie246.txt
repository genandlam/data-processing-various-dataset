BEN: - and today it is right that we should ask ourselves the one most important question: what is the purpose of these years, the purpose for all this demanding work, the purpose for the sacrifices made those who love us? were there not a purpose, then all of these past years of struggle, of fierce competition and of uncom- promising ambition would be mean- ingless. but, of course, there is a purpose and i must tell it to you. i ask you to remember this purpose always and i pledge that i shall endeavor to carry it with me forever.

BEN: aren't you?
MRS. ROBINSON: why no. i hadn't thought of it. i feel rather flattered that you -
BEN: mrs. robinson, will you forgive me for what i just said?
MRS. ROBINSON: it's all right.
BEN: it's not all right, it's the worst thing i've ever said to anyone.
MRS. ROBINSON: sit down.
BEN: please forgive me. because i like you. i don't think of you that way. but i'm mixed up.
MRS. ROBINSON: all right. now finish your drink.

BEN: i don't remember her as having brown eyes.
MRS. ROBINSON: benjamin?
BEN: yes?
MRS. ROBINSON: will you unzip my dress?
MRS. ROBINSON: i think i'll go to bed.
BEN: oh. well, goodnight.
MRS. ROBINSON: won't you unzip my dress?
BEN: i'd rather not, mrs. robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON: if you still think i'm trying to seduce you -

MRS. ROBINSON: benjamin - you've known me all your life.
BEN: i know that. but i'm -
MRS. ROBINSON: come on.
MRS. ROBINSON: it's hard for me to reach.
MRS. ROBINSON: thank you.
BEN: right.
MRS. ROBINSON: what are you so scared of?
BEN: i'm not scared, mrs. robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON: then why do you keep running away?
BEN: because you're going to bed. i don't think i should be up here.
MRS. ROBINSON: haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
BEN: yes, i have - he looks up at the portrait of elaine.
BEN: but i just - look - what if mr.
MRS. ROBINSON: what if he did?
BEN: well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
MRS. ROBINSON: don't you think he trusts us together?
BEN: of course he does. but he might get the wrong idea.
MRS. ROBINSON: i don't see why. i'm twice as old as you are. how could anyone think -
BEN: but they would! don't you see?
MRS. ROBINSON: benjamin - i'm not trying to seduce you. i wish you'd -
BEN: i know that. but please, mrs. robinson. this is difficult for me.
MRS. ROBINSON: why is it?
BEN: because i am confused about things. i can't tell what i'm imagining. i can't tell what's real. i can't -
MRS. ROBINSON: would you like me to seduce you?
BEN: what?
MRS. ROBINSON: is that what you're trying to tell me?
BEN: i'm going home now. i apologize for what i said. i hope you can forget it. but i'm going home right now.

BEN: yes.

BEN: i'm putting it on the top step.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: for sake, benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
BEN: i'm putting it here by the door.
MRS. ROBINSON'S VOICE: will you bring it in to me?
BEN: i'd rather not.

MR. BRADDOCK: would you mind telling me then - what were those four years of college for? what was the point of all that hard work?
BEN: you got me.
MR. BRADDOCK: now listen, ben. i think it's a very good thing that a young man - after he's done some very good work - should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in him- self and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
MRS. BRADDOCK: the robinson's are here.
MR. ROBINSON: hi, ben. what are you doing with yourself these days?
BEN: oh - not too much. taking it easy.

MRS. BRADDOCK: benjamin, i'm not going to pry into your affairs, but i'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest.
BEN: well, wait.
BEN: you think i'm being dishonest?
BEN: well why do you - why do you think that?
MRS. BRADDOCK: because i know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
BEN: oh. well, i don't. shall i tell you what i do?
MRS. BRADDOCK: not if you don't want to.
BEN: i do.
MRS. BRADDOCK: but i don't want you to make up something.
BEN: i'm not. but i'm - i'm not very proud of what i do. i usually get kind of drunk. i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. then i take a hotel room. so i won't have to drive home on the freeway. i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after -
MRS. BRADDOCK: goodnight, benjamin.
BEN: you believe me, don't you?
MRS. BRADDOCK: no.
BEN: you don't?
BEN: but i want you to. please. please will you believe me.

MRS. BRADDOCK: goodnight. 
BEN'S VOICE: wait a minute.

BEN: wait a minute. sit down a minute. 
BEN: will you please sit down a minute.
BEN: will you leave that shoe on for a minute. please.
BEN: now - do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
MRS. ROBINSON: if you want.
BEN: good. i mean are we dead or something?
MRS. ROBINSON: well i just don't think we have much to say to each other.
BEN: all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
MRS. ROBINSON: are you tired of it?
BEN: i'm not. no. but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
MRS. ROBINSON: well what do you want to talk about?
BEN: anything. anything at all.
MRS. ROBINSON: do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
BEN: oh my
MRS. ROBINSON: well?
BEN: mrs. robinson. if that's the best we can do let's just get the god- clothes off and -- she reaches for her shoe.
BEN: leave it on! now we are going to do this thing. we are going to have a conversation. think of another topic.
MRS. ROBINSON: how about art.
BEN: art. that's a good subject.
MRS. ROBINSON: you start it off. i don't know anything about it.
BEN: oh.
MRS. ROBINSON: don't you?
BEN: yes i do. i know quite a bit about it.
MRS. ROBINSON: go ahead then.
BEN: art. well what do you want to know about it.
BEN: are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
MRS. ROBINSON: neither.
BEN: you're not interested in art?
MRS. ROBINSON: no.
BEN: then why do you want to talk about it?
MRS. ROBINSON: i don't.
MRS. ROBINSON: can i take off my clothes now?
BEN: no. think of another topic.
MRS. ROBINSON: do you really want me to?
BEN: yes i do.
MRS. ROBINSON: i got up.
MRS. ROBINSON: do you want to hear it or not?
BEN: yes. but you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
MRS. ROBINSON: i got up. i ate breakfast and went shopping. during the after- noon i read a novel.
BEN: what one.
MRS. ROBINSON: what?
BEN: what novel did you read.
MRS. ROBINSON: i don't remember.
MRS. ROBINSON: then i fixed supper for my husband and waited until -
BEN: there!
MRS. ROBINSON: what?
BEN: your husband! mrs. robinson! there's something we could have a conversation about.
MRS. ROBINSON: him?
BEN: i mean everything. i don't know anything about how you - how you work this. i don't know how you get out of the house at night. i don't know the risk involved.
MRS. ROBINSON: there isn't any.
BEN: there's no risk?
BEN: how do you get out of the house?
MRS. ROBINSON: i walk out.
BEN: you walk right out the door.
BEN: what do you say to him?
MRS. ROBINSON: he's asleep.
BEN: always?
MRS. ROBINSON: benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
BEN: please. now tell me. how do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
MRS. ROBINSON: because he takes sleeping pills. he takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
BEN: but what about the noise from the car. what if -
MRS. ROBINSON: the driveway's on my side of the house.
BEN: we're talking.
MRS. ROBINSON: what?
BEN: we're talking, mrs. robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON: calm down, benjamin.
BEN: now let's keep going here.
MRS. ROBINSON: can i undress and talk at the same time?
BEN: right.
MRS. ROBINSON: thank you.
BEN: now. you say the driveway's on your side of the house. so i guess you don't sleep in the same room.
MRS. ROBINSON: we don't.
BEN: so you don't - i mean i don't like to seem like i'm prying but i guess you don't sleep together or anything.
MRS. ROBINSON: no we don't.
BEN: well how long has this been going on.
MRS. ROBINSON: about five years.
BEN: oh no. are you kidding me?
MRS. ROBINSON: no.
BEN: you have not slept with your husband for five years?
MRS. ROBINSON: now and then. he geats drunk a few times a year.
BEN: how many times a year.
MRS. ROBINSON: on new year's eve. sometimes on his birthday.
BEN: man, is this interesting.
MRS. ROBINSON: is it?
BEN: so you don't love him. you wouldn't say you -
MRS. ROBINSON: we've talked enough, benjamin.
BEN: wait a minute. so you wouldn't say you loved him.
MRS. ROBINSON: not exactly.
BEN: but you don't hate him.
MRS. ROBINSON: no, benjamin. i don't hate him.
BEN: well how do you feel about him, then?
MRS. ROBINSON: i don't.
BEN: well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
MRS. ROBINSON: is it?
BEN: i mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. if you hated him at least you'd hate him.
BEN: well you loved him once, i assume. when you first knew him.
MRS. ROBINSON: no.
BEN: what?
MRS. ROBINSON: i never did, benjamin. now let's -
BEN: well, wait a minute. you married him.
BEN: why did you do that?
MRS. ROBINSON: see if you can guess.
BEN: well i can't.
MRS. ROBINSON: think real hard, benjamin.
BEN: i can't see why you did, unless ...you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
MRS. ROBINSON: don't tell elaine.
BEN: oh no. you had to marry him because you got pregnant?
MRS. ROBINSON: are you shocked?
BEN: well i never thought of you and mr. robinson as the kind of people who...
MRS. ROBINSON: all right. now let's get to bed.
BEN: wait a minute. wait a minute.
MRS. ROBINSON: what?
BEN: i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
MRS. ROBINSON: not particularly.
BEN: was he a law student at the time?
BEN: and you were a student also.
MRS. ROBINSON: yes.
BEN: at college.
MRS. ROBINSON: yes.
BEN: what was your major?
MRS. ROBINSON: why are you asking me all this?
BEN: because i'm interested, mrs. robinson. now what was your major subject at college?
MRS. ROBINSON: art.
BEN: art?
BEN: but i thought you - i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
MRS. ROBINSON: kind of.
BEN: well how did it happen?
MRS. ROBINSON: how do you think.
BEN: i mean did he take you up to his room with him? did you go to a hotel?
MRS. ROBINSON: benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
BEN: i'm curious.
MRS. ROBINSON: we'd go to his car.
BEN: oh no. in the car you did it?
MRS. ROBINSON: i don't think we were the first.
BEN: what kind of car was it?
MRS. ROBINSON: what?
BEN: do you remember the make of the car?
MRS. ROBINSON: oh my
BEN: really. i want to know.
MRS. ROBINSON: it was a ford, benjamin.
BEN: a ford! a ford! goddamnit, a ford! that's great!
MRS. ROBINSON: that's enough.
BEN: so old elaine robinson got started in a ford.
MRS. ROBINSON: don't talk about elaine.
BEN: don't talk about elaine?
MRS. ROBINSON: no.
BEN: why not?
MRS. ROBINSON: because i don't want you to.
BEN: well why don't you?
BEN: i wish you'd tell me.
MRS. ROBINSON: there's nothing to tell.
BEN: well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
BEN: well - i guess i'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
MRS. ROBINSON: benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
MRS. ROBINSON: do you understand that?
BEN: well look. i have no intention of taking her out.
MRS. ROBINSON: good.
BEN: i was just kidding around.
MRS. ROBINSON: good.
BEN: but why shouldn't i?
MRS. ROBINSON: i have my reasons.
BEN: then let's hear them.
MRS. ROBINSON: no.
BEN: let's hear your reasons, mrs. robinson. because i think i know what they are.
BEN: i'm not good enough for her to associate with, am i? i'm not good enough to even talk about her, am i?
MRS. ROBINSON: let's drop it.
BEN: we're not dropping it. now that's the reason, isn't it? i'm a dirty degenerate, aren't i? i'm not fit to -
MRS. ROBINSON: benjamin?
BEN: i'm good enough for you but i'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. that's it, isn't it? isn't it?
MRS. ROBINSON: yes.
BEN: you go to hell. you go straight to hell, mrs. robinson. do you think i'm proud of myself? do you think i'm proud of this?
MRS. ROBINSON: i wouldn't know.
BEN: well, i'm not.
MRS. ROBINSON: you're not.
BEN: no sir. i am not proud that i spend my time with a broken- down alcoholic!
MRS. ROBINSON: i see.
BEN: and if you think i come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
BEN: because - mrs. robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. and you do what you want but i'm getting the out.
MRS. ROBINSON: are you?
BEN: you're right i am.
MRS. ROBINSON: that's how you feel about me.
MRS. ROBINSON: that i'm a sick and disgusting person.
BEN: now don't start this.
MRS. ROBINSON: what?
BEN: don't start acting hurt.
MRS. ROBINSON: don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
BEN: mrs. robinson, you stand there and tell me i'm not good enough for your daughter.
MRS. ROBINSON: did i say that?
BEN: of course you did.
MRS. ROBINSON: benjamin, i want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
BEN: well two minutes ago you told me i wasn't good enough for your daughter. now you say you're sorry i got that impression.
MRS. ROBINSON: i didn't mean it. i don't think you'd be right for each other. but i would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
BEN: you wouldn't.
MRS. ROBINSON: of course i wouldn't.
BEN: what are you doing?
MRS. ROBINSON: well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
BEN: well look - i was kind of upset there. i'm sorry i said those things.
MRS. ROBINSON: if that's how you feel -
BEN: but it's not.
MRS. ROBINSON: that's all right. i think i can understand why i'm disgusting to you.
BEN: oh no. look - i like you. i wouldn't keep coming here if i didn't like you.
MRS. ROBINSON: but if it's sickening for you -
BEN: it's not! i enjoy it! i look forward to it. it's the one thing i have to look forward to.
MRS. ROBINSON: you don't have to say that.
BEN: well i wouldn't. i would never say it if it wasn't true.
MRS. ROBINSON: may i stay then?
BEN: yes. please. i want you to.
MRS. ROBINSON: thank you.
BEN: well don't thank me, because i want you to.
MRS. ROBINSON: but you won't ever take out elaine, will you? i want you to promise me that.
BEN: look. why the did you bring this up. it never occured to me to take her out.
MRS. ROBINSON: then give me your word you won't.
BEN: this is absurd.
MRS. ROBINSON: promise me, benjamin.
BEN: all right, for christ's sake. i promise i will never take out elaine robinson.
MRS. ROBINSON: thank you. benjamin -
BEN: let's not talk about it. let's not talk at all.

MRS. BRADDOCK: it's pretty embarrassing. i really don't know what to tell mr. robinson. it's ackward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine. 
BEN: next time he suggests it, i'll tell him i have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
MR. BRADDOCK: i guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
BEN: look - elaine robinson and i do not get along.
MR. BRADDOCK: how do you know? you haven't seen her since high school. i guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
BEN: that has nothing to do with it -
MR. BRADDOCK: i guess i'll just tell mr. robinson that you're just too busy every evening - doing knows what -
MRS. BRADDOCK: don't go on like this. now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out -
BEN: i do.
MRS. BRADDOCK: - then i'll simply invite all the robinsons' over for dinner on thursday.

BEN: the day after tomorrow?
ELAINE: maybe we are and maybe we aren't.

MR. ROBINSON: do you want - do you want to try and tell me why you did it? 
BEN: mr. robinson?
MR. ROBINSON: do you have a special grudge against me? do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
BEN: no, it's not --
MR. ROBINSON: is there something i've said that's caused this contempt? or is it just the things i stand for that you despise?
BEN: it was nothing to do with you, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: well, ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
BEN: now look - please -
MR. ROBINSON: ben, i think we're two civilized human beings. do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
BEN: i am not threatening you.
MR. ROBINSON: do you want to unclench your fists, please? thank you. i can see in the dark, you know. i've been here quite a while.
BEN: i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you, mr. robinson. i am trying to tell you i do not resent you.
MR. ROBINSON: you don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
BEN: no, i don't.
MR. ROBINSON: well, i don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, ben. i do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon.
BEN: but why?
MR. ROBINSON: why?
BEN: it shouldn't make any difference what happened.
MR. ROBINSON: that's quite a statement.
BEN: listen to me. we got - we got into bed with each other. but it was nothing. it was nothing at all. we might - we might just as well have been shaking hands.
MR. ROBINSON: shaking hands. well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
BEN: you miss the point.
MR. ROBINSON: don't shout at me, ben.
BEN: the point is - i don't love your wife. i love your daughter, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: well - i'm sure you think you do, ben, but after a few times in bed with elaine i feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you -

MR. ROBINSON: i think i've talked about this enough. i don't know how far i can go, ben. i don't know if i can prosecute or not, but i think maybe i can. in the light of what's happened i think maybe i can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. i have seen elaine and i have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure... 
MR. ROBINSON: stay away from me, ben!
MR. ROBINSON: i don't want to mince words with you. as far as elaine's concerned you're to get her out of your filthy mind right now. is that perfectly clear ro you? that's all, ben. you'll pardon me if i don't shake hands with you.
MR. ROBINSON: i think you are filth.
MR. ROBINSON: i think you are scum.
MR. ROBINSON: you are a degenerate!

BEN: mr. mccleery - do you have some change? i need to use the phone? mr. mccleery i want you out of here. 
BEN: look - i'll give you ten dollars for a dime - i'll give you twenty - for sake, will you let me use that phone? mr. mccleery i am going to call the police now.
