and I would like to get uh aisle seats on those please

xx ok let me pull up the flight number three seventy two arrival San Jose at
xx seven fifteen and round trip fare is one hundred and ninety eight dollars
xx non penalty now aisle seating is confirmed for the outbound
xx I cannot get you a aisle on the return let me take a look and see if I
xx can get you a window
hmm (??

xx gee) that's a busy day Friday's always bad

xx yeah looks like it's a popular flight, the best I could do would be um
xx a middle seat right now (but that would be

xx well do what you can) and we'll st- you know try to switch it before then
xx if possible 

xx yeah you can also um when you check in in San Jose before you leave you
xx can always make the switch then

yeah

xx cause it is the day of the departure so if you've got a little extra time
xx or something um and I will see if I can change it up until that point

ok and I'd like a Hertz car ah an intermediate there's three of us going
to be going and um on Hertz express

xx all righty let me pull that up 
xx and I'm just waiting for a confirmation number on the car

ok while you're waiting they're going to be two other people in a
different uh org that are going to be taking the same flight and um their
last names are EE, first name F

xx ok

and GG [spells name] , first name HH so if you want to put them on for
the same reservation I'll ah

xx understand that

well that's kind of what) I thought

xx yeah

ya I I uh they they'll want to get on the same uh flight that I do and
they'll have to call you directly with the travel advance numbers and so

xx other then that you're all set

ok great

xx all right thank you

thanks very much

xx uh huh, bye (bye

bye)

Hi A this is B over in Dr. C's office

xx uh huh

and we need to get an estimate on how much uh for a round trip ticket to
Little Rock Arkansas

xx oh

leaving from San Jose

xx ok ah is there any particular date that you're looking for

uh he would like to leave um possibly the afternoon of the twenty eighth
of October

xx ok
xx so let's take a look here.  basic fare quote um prices can range anywhere
xx from a full coach fare of what one thousand seventy round trip

mm hmm

xx all the way down to a nonrefundable price of three hundred and fifty
xx eight dollars, it all depends on what's available at the time of his
xx booking and if he's going to be staying over a Saturday night and if
xx he's going to purchase the tickets at least fourteen days prior to his
xx departure and willing to take a penalty fare

ok he will be leaving uh returning actually on the the Thursday after

xx ok so let me take a look here oh so he would be staying over a Saturday
xx night. if he's leaving on the twenty eighth that is a Saturday

uh huh

xx that would qualify him as long as he purchased the tickets fourteen days
xx prior to that departure date so he would have to umm have reservations made
xx and ticketed by the thirteenth of uh October

uh huh

xx again this is provided that the flights are available

ok

xx when he calls to make the reservation
xx um we can get him on a nonrefundable fare for you know a fairly good price
xx compared to one thousand seventy

ok

xx one thousand seventy is completely non penalty and that is the lowest non
xx penalty available in that market

xx oh it's non penalty and the nonrefundable is uh fourteen days prior to
xx departure and provided that the flights are available

xx available right and it's um that can be as low as um three fifty eight
xx and also three eighteen there's one it depends on what you know day
xx of the week we're looking at if he's gonna travel on a Saturday three
xx fifty eight would apply, if he were travelling midweek still staying over
xx a Saturday night there's the three eighteen fare then the fare could range
xx anywhere even higher than that three seventy eight for a twenty five
xx percent penalty fare travelling mid week

uh huh

xx also staying over a Saturday night that's based on a seven day advanced
xx purchase or four eighteen round trip also twenty five percent penalty
xx also seven day advanced purchase with a Saturday night stay over but
xx travelling on weekend days and that would be pretty much the uh the
xx breakdown

xx ok the four eighteen is the highest for the

xx for the discounted
xx the highest for the lowest

right right

xx and then it would jump from there to the full coach non penalty for one
xx thousand seventy

ok

xx (ok?

so) I could tell him a ra- p-pretty much a range between three twenty
five to four eighteen depending on the discount 

xx right

xx and the time (of uh when he places 

xx and time of booking) and yeah

xx the actual reservation

right

ok but if he wants to go with the lowest non penalty coach he's gotta pay ??

xx the full coach yeah they don't offer unfortunately any discounts without
xx penalties for that market

ok

xx ok?

I'll let him know that

xx all righty sure

thanks A

xx uh huh  Bye Bye 

Bye bye

xx Express this is A

A I'm BB CC

xx Hi

EE FF would like to book those tickets for th- coming in this Thursday

xx ok great

xx so go ahead with that

all righty

thank you

oh also oh we didn't need a tA I'm sorry that was somebody else he's going
on personal travel I thought we needed a travel advance from you

xx no no no (and I'm still

it's been a busy) morning

trying to find out on that other for GGG

xx ok great

ok thank you

xx sure thanks BB (Bye Bye

bye bye

xx American Express this is A

Hi good morning uh I'm BB CC from WWW

xx mm hmm

and uh let's see I'd like to make some travel arrangements I'd made
made some arrangements on Monday that have to be changed

xx ok

and they're g- and they were to go to uh uh Research Triangle uh
Research Triangle Park North Carolina

xx ok it looks like we've got you going into Raleigh Durham

ok that's fine

xx [recording notification]

xx ok now what did you want to change on your reservation

yes I wanted to change the uh uh departure date from the tenth to the
sixteenth

ok and did you want to go on the same same flight into Raleigh at seven
fifty in the morning (nonstop?

uh since) it would be leaving on Sunday it would be nice to leave about
twelve

xx ok let's see San Francisco to Raleigh  the only thing I have leaving at
xx noon would be a connection on Delta through Atlanta it would get in at
xx nine fifty p.m.

ok

xx all righty then let me confirm that for you and what else needed to be
xx changed then looks like were going have to change your car and hotel

ah yes the uh ??

xx how long

we don't need to make reservations in the hotel

xx ok

they'll take care of that um uh I'll need the Hertz car and I I I have
to make plans to stay through the week so I'd be leaving on Friday

xx ok so Friday's going to be the twenty first and (what time of day

about six)

xx about six ok all righty I've got a Piedmont flight that leaves at five
xx fifty five it's a change of planes in Charlotte North Carolina and gets
xx into San Francisco at nine fifty four there's also a US Air flight at
xx six twenty changing planes in Pittsburg arrival is at ten thirty

ok ahh the cheaper of the two would be fine

xx ok let me take a look and price them both
xx ok round trip Delta and Piedmont is the first one I'm going to price, and
xx that comes out to a fare of nine sixteen, let's take a look at ah
xx returning on US Air if that's going to make a difference
xx they're both going to come out to the same fare so you've got a choice of
xx going through Charlotte North Carolina at five fifty five arrival at nine
xx fifty four or through Pittsburg at six twenty arrival at ten thirty

I'll take the Piedmont flight

xx all righty then that would be a total of nine sixteen round trip for the
xx lowest fare and that would involve a twenty five percent penalty for
xx making any changes or refunds

well I think that's probably not a good idea

xx ok the non lowest non penalty fare in that case would be ten ten    

ok we'll go with that

xx all righty and you still want to go with the compact car

yes

xx in Raleigh, ok.  and I'm just confirming that for you right now
xx and waiting on car confirmation
xx ok that's all confirmed and we're all set to go with that when do you
xx want uh to have your ticket issued

ahm oh sometime this week

xx ok

er er let's see no sometime next week

xx next week

will be fine

xx all righty let me let me change it to lets see how about um if we do it
xx Thursday of next week or We- let's do it Wednesday and deliver them on
xx Thursday that way you'll have them before the weekend

good yes yes

xx ok

since I'm leaving on Sunday

xx ok really ok then you're all set and non penalty fare let me make sure
xx I can get your seats non smoking windows on all flights

yes I'd prefer that

xx let's see and let me give you all the flight information too
xx well it looks like we're not having any luck with umm ou- the Delat flight
xx on the sixteen the July from San Francisco to Atlanta the only thing I
xx could confirm would be a middle seat however I could get you the only
xx thing I could get would be like an aisle in smoking nothing in non smoking
xx except for middles

I really prefer to go the middle seat non smoking

xx ok

yeah

xx then let me go with twenty twenty one E at least that in a bulkhead seat
xx give you a little bit more leg room there and let me give you the flight
xx information
xx leaving on the sixteenth Delta fligth one one six

one one six

xx departing out of San Francisco at twelve noon

ok

xx arrival in Atlanta is at seven thirty five p.m. and connecting there to
xx Delta flight six one eight leaving from Atlanta at eight thirty two p.m.

ok

xx and arrival in Raleigh at nine fifty
xx and then returning on the twenty first of July on Friday Piedmont flight
xx one zero zero five 


mm hmm

xx and that's going to depart at five fifty five and arrive Charlotte six
xx thirty eight where you would connect to Piedmont flight twelve sixty seven
xx and that's departing at seven thirty five from Charlotte arrival back in
xx San Francisco at nine fifty four and the flight from Atlanta to Raleigh
xx on Delta eight sixteen I was able to get you a window seat in non smoking

good

xx and Piedmont unfortunately we can't look at their seat maps so I can't
xx tell you exactly what seat numbers we are confirming but I will request
xx non smoking windows

ok good

xx ok

uh huh thank you very much

xx all right thank you bye bye 

bye bye

xx -----

xx [recording notification]

xx ok umm between eight fifty there is not an American flight there's an
xx Alaska Air flight at ten fifteen

Alaska Air

xx it get's into Seattle at twelve fifteen

at twelve fifteen

xx mm hmm

and once again what time does that leave ten

xx ten fifteen a.m. 

ten fifteen a.m. does that change uh the cost

xx uh let me take a look would they be returning on the same flight

xx th- they would be returning on American Airlines number two two five that was-

xx that was

xx a good time

xx at five twenty o.k.

mmh hmmm

xx let's see

xx ok the fare we were holding at was two fifty eight this would uh increase
xx it by forty dollars so it would be

xx oh my

xx four ninety eight

that's fine you said two ninety eight exactly

two ninety eight right

xx right round (trip

xx it would not) be um it would not be non refundable it would be a twenty
xx five percent penalty for changes or refunds

xx ok um could you give me the flight number on that then that's Alaska Airlines

xx Alaska Air flight one five nine 

one five nine

xx on out of San Jose on the twenty nineth at ten fifteen a.m. arrival Seattle
xx at twelve fifteen

ok terrific

xx do you want me to book that

yes please do

xx ok the let me request seating on that one and

xx and then we will go ahead and book for the American Airlines the return
xx flight number two two five

xx ok so we'll keep that the same

mm hmm

xx all righty and so do we have final approval or or we're still waiting

xx and I do have the travel advance         

xx ok so I'm in uh let's see whose record an I in right now

Pardon 

xx I'm just checking on whose reservation I was in right now

ok

xx ok DDD I'm in

ok

xx ??his travel advance

his number then is [digits]

xx ok
xx and for EEE

it's [digits]

xx all right ok

and I did give you a charge number on that didn't I

xx yes you did

xx ok that's stands the same

ok

xx and I think that's it so the tickets would be ready for pickup (probably

xx um) these will be ready well we can run them today now the twenty five
xx percent penalty fare that will be valid throught the twentieth of July

mm hmm

xx if you wanted to wait
xx it was just the non refundable had to be issued within twenty four hours

umm ( and in order to

xx did you want to ??)

xx uh get that that price it would have to be issued within twenty four hours
xx is that correct

xx for for the nonrefundable that was the one we were holding ?? with the
xx American round trip

right right

xx but this but the two ninety eight is twenty five percent penalty uh we
xx do not have to issue it uh within twenty four hours

that's fine

xx through the you want to still go ahead and do it today

um just ticket it but I mean it's no rush when when we we get it

xx ok

ok

xx all righty thanks a lot CCC

thank you

xx all righty bye bye

bye

xx -----

Hi I'd like to make a couple of arrangements

xx ok is it for domestic or international

ah domestic

xx ok BBB 
xx [recording notification]

xx ok who's the traveller then the first one

ah the traveller will be CCC DDD [spells name]

xx ok I think that uh I don't know if this is the same trip we're thiking of
xx on the fourteenth of July

it sure is

xx ok I've already made it with um EEE FFF he (called up

yeah great)

xx so all I needed was the travel advance for him

ok the travel advance is [digits]

xx ok?? and do you want me to read off the flights

yes would you please

xx that uh we've gone through
xx sure on the fourteenth of July it's American flight fourteen oh four
xx leaving San Jose at seven a.m.

mm hmm

xx arrival into LAX at eight eleven

mm hmm

xx and then returning that same day on American flight three seventy two

mm hmm

xx and that's departing at six p.m. from LA arrival San Jose at seven fifteen

ok

xx and they were confirmed at a fare of one ninety eight there were no
xx penalties attached to that fare

mm

xx and the only that uh was a stumbling block in the  reservations was the
xx return seat on American flight three seventy two we could only get middle
xx seating for all three passengers

oh

xx and I advised Mr. FFF of that and he said they would um look into it when
xx the check in in San Jose (?? change that one

yeah that's a good idea) to do that

ok

xx ok so this will be exactly the duplicate for Mr. HHH except that his um
xx advance number is [digits]

[repeats digits]

xx ok

thank you very much A

xx sure BBB no problem

xx ok dear bye bye

bye

xx -----

May I speak to MMM please

xx yeah hello

xx Hi it's A with American Express Travel

great um I need to make some reservations for two people

xx ok is it going to be for domestic travel

yes it is 

xx [recording notification]

xx ok um who is the first traveller going to be

CCC DDD [spells last name]

xx all righty let me pull up the profile for him
xx ok we don't have a profile for him he must ah is he a new traveller or

no he's travelled before but he is not one of the regulars so that might be

he hasn't he hasn't filled out the form probably in any case they're available in the travel office if he does want to fill one out

xx ok

xx and let's see I need his employee number please

[digits]

xx ok and the charge number for the trip

[digits]

xx woops ok and his travel advance number

[digits]

xx all righty  and let's see what is the date of travel going to be

July twelvth

xx from where to where

he's going to go San Francisco to Newark and he would like to arrive in Newark around six o'clock at night and he would request an United flight

xx ok the closest thing I have to arriving at that time would be a flight
xx leaving at eight twenty from San Francisco arrival time in Newark
xx would be four forty three other than that United would have a flight
xx arriving at eight fifty one

that sounds just fine the eight twenty flight

xx the eight twenty a.m. ok and that would be nonstop what about would
xx he be continuing on or returning home

ah were just going to leave it with an open return

xx ok so were not going to make a resevation or you want me to ticket
xx something with an open ticket

yes please give him the ticket and that way all he has to do when he
gets back to Newark is to have them plunk in a number

xx ok and does he have a specific um an approximate date I should put
xx in here

xx it could be anywhere from two to four weeks

oh ok then why don't I say um

xx well just give him a full fare coach and don't worry about it

xx ok we just have to put in um a um a fake fake date in there so it
xx reads it ok all righty then let me give you the round trip fare for
xx that it's one thousand seventy six is the lowest fare that we could
xx confirm it's a non penalty fare of course and let's uh

sounds pretty good I think the last time the guy told him it was
almost twelve hundred

xx really

yeah

xx that's ah that's fairly uh fairly low in fact the outbound flight is
xx pricing at a discounted fare without um without any penalty so that's
xx probably why it's so

great

xx so low and let me get him his seat assignments what type would he
xx prefer for United the flight out

uh I think can we hold off the seat assignments for about a half an
hour and I'll get hold of him

xx yes sure

cause, I ?? normally

xx ok sure that's no problem does he

and we have to do one more

xx did you get a hotel or information or anything like that

nope and they don't need a car either

xx ok so let me put in um that we don't need that
xx ok when do you want the tickets issued  

xx um (that's not a 

do it on Monday)

xx problem for us


xx ok I'm just confirming his fare right now and then we'll go to the next one
xx ok who's the other traveller going to be

he's one of our machinists so I know you don't have a profile on him
GGG HHH [spells last name]

and [repeats first name]

xx yeah

and his employee number

[digits]

xx same charge number

yep [digits]

xx ok and his travel advance number

[digits]

xx ok

are you I'm sorry

xx ok and it's going to be the same uh the same itinerary

yes please

xx and also uh open return

ah he has asked if it wouldn't be any problem if he can have a Newark
to Los Angeles open return

xx sure that's no problem I'll go ahead and issue that and uh let's see
xx ok that round trip um so to speak round trip with open return is one
xx thousand fifty five so it's lower to go to LA I guess

wow

xx and that's again non penalty and everything is confirmed for that do
xx you have his seating request by any chance

I will call him right now

xx ok and no hotel no car

can I put you on hold for just a sec

xx sure sure

thank you

well it's a good thing I checked with him he has changed his plans

xx oh

open return should be San F- to San Francisco not LA

xx ok sure then let me um

yeah he thinks a smoking window would be great

xx smoking window

xx ok then I'll go ahead let me request that on ah United flight twelve 

and CCC DDD

xx mm hmm

would like a smoking aisle is there any chance we can get the two of
them together

xx sure let me take a look and see what we've got

great

xx well looks like the best I could do would be um only two aisles
xx there's no window's in n- smoking available, so I could put them in
xx one seat in front of the other or I could put them in ah two aisles
xx with a middle seat between them, in the central section of the p- of
xx the flight cause the the two seats and there are three seats in the
xx center of the plane and then two seats again and within the three seat
xx section I could put them both on an aisle seat and there'd be a middle
xx seat that's empty between them right now

xx hang on just a sec
umm oh this is tough isn't it

xx yeah there's unfortunately there are no umm aisles across from each
xx other this way they would just have be in the middle section they're I
xx can't guarantee that no one will be sitting between them but middle
xx seats are usually the last last seats to be assigned

can can we go to the center section of three seats and get them two
side by side

xx sure one will (be in the middle ok
xx one on the aisle)

xx I'll do that then I'll put them in thirty c and thirty or er thirty d

great

xx ok

ok

xx all right bye everything's set and um NNN will give you a call on
xx Monday when they're both uh ready to be picked up

great

xx uh huh

um I just wondered they said to me you know we're government
contractor and you made the reservation for me for for the last week
um

at at the Palo Alto Holiday Inn what what signal do I have to give the
Holiday Inn people to what proof that I'm you know that I'm with WWW
and I'm I'm a gov government on this government thing they said bring
some sort of government number

xx I think as long as you've got your WWW id that's enough

I see you think that's that's all it takes

xx that is that should be all it takes because they are uh they honor it
xx for all WWW employees normally a lot of people ask us for governmetn
xx rates at specific hotels or airlines or

mm hmm

xx what have you and you have to have some type of government badge or
xx government id

yes

number from them I I I live in London, England

something in in writing how do we do that

xx mmm um

I mean if I gave you the confirmation number could you could you just
uh get sort of a I mean type out a

xx of stuff about the hotel plus the confirmation number
