xx American Express this is A

A this is B.C. calling from WWW

xx Hi

and why don't you bring up my record

...

xx and it's for which trip

the trip that I'm suppose to take tomorrow night

xx ok I'll pull that one up all righty

ok now here's the problem I just learned today that I'm going to have to go to Richmond on Friday I have to be in Richmond on Friday Richmond, Virginia

xx ok

so we keep the San Francisco to Newark tomorrow night that's fine

xx ok

the the number the August first ten thirty the question is how can I get can I get to Ne- Newark to Richmond either Thursday afternoon or Friday morning early I don't have to be there until about ten o'clock

xx ok there's uh depends on what you'd rather do there is a Piedmont flight which is non stop from Newark to Richmond leaving at four oh five in the afternoon on a Thursday

right

xx and getting into Richmond at five sixteen

yeah

xx or if you wanted to go in the morning of the fourth um the only ?? the only non stop would have to be out of Laguardia

there's no

xx out of Newark it would be at nine thirty you would not get in until ten forty one

ok umm there is one at what time on Thursday afternoon

xx Thursday at four oh five

Thursday at four oh five how late is there any later connections of any sort

xx later connections there's a later nonstop at nine
( get's in at

a later nonstop at nine)

xx yeah get's in at ten eleven

what about ah and there are probably connections

xx between the time let me check

between those times right

xx yeah there's a let's see ok there's a United flight that leaves at six twenty um ooh however that's going to be sold out um ?? there's a seven fifty five Piedmont that goes through Baltimore as a connecting city and gets into Richmond at ten twenty nine

same time as the other one

xx right

all right why don't you book both E.F. and B.C. cause we're flying together on the four o'clock Newark

xx Richmond  

Richmond

xx ok and then

and then if we have to stay later we'll juggle it at that end

xx ok now what about your

and then we need a hotel to stay in in Richmond

xx ...[break in transcript]

xx ok w- what about your return how many

uh (well

xx ?? nights)

I think he's going to you know I better let E. do his own

xx ok

but that's what I think he's going to do because I think he's going to fly back up to New York and come back on his regularly scheduled return on Saturday

xx ok well right now I'm working within ah within your (reservation

within my reservation)

xx yeah

but but ah I'll have E. call because he may want to make some adjustments (but

xx ok)

xx at the moment it's B.C. down to Richmond on Thursday afternoon

ok

xx on the four o'clock

all righty

xx a place to stay Thursday night

xx ....[break in transcript]


let's assume a departure around one thirty or two o'clock no earlier than that

xx ok

on Friday to return to either San Jose or San Francisco San Jose is preferable only because I live down in that direction

xx ok then everything would be a connecting flight either to San Francisco or to San Jose

right 

xx the only problem is frequency of flights into San Jose 

yeah

xx are limited the

I do like American and  I know one could presumably maybe go Richmond to Raleigh Durham

xx or there's a Richmond to Dallas is are (the connections offered

or Richmond to Dallas)

xx um there's a flight offered but it's at twelve twenty three p.m.

hmmm

xx um through Dallas into San Jose at five twenty seven the next flight after that is at five oh seven uh  changing planes it's a United changing planes in Chicago and getting in at nine thirty into San Jose
xx other than that the next American's at five thirty and it's a change of planes in Dallas and into (San Jose a- at eleven 

ok all right so) that's just American

xx that's just um other than United at five oh seven through Chicago that was United there is a Piedmont flight at one thirty five through Charlotte North Carolina it would have to go you would have to go into San Francisco though in order to take that

oh but that's about the right time I mean ah ???

xx yeah

?? to the airlines it's it's whatever is going to get me there

xx right

bu- but the time seems to be about right the one thirty  Piedmont

xx ok 

what is it now

xx it's Piedmont it goes to Charlotte North Carolina as a connection city and then you go into San Francisco and arrival time at San Francisco's at six thirty seven

why don't we do that one 

xx ok

that seems about the right time (??

xx all right) then the  round trip fare is eleven sixty two again no penalties attached to that 

mm hmm
xx (that's

xx and)

including whatever I've got going the United flight going (out

xx out)right

yeah

xx that's the total round trip price and what we'll do is reissue um for the brand new fare

yeah

xx let me give you the flight information

well that's ok

xx oh you don't ok

I don't need that but what I do need is I suddenly recall that I'm going to back you up and I apologize for this too Wednsday night there is no lodging and what I would like to do is to get a room at the Marriot in Newark Airport

...

xx ok thanks a lot for callling

right bye bye

xx bye

A. this is B. I need some help trying to get from Seattle to uh San Francisco Monday night the

xx seventh

seventh or Tuesday morning the eighth

xx ok

My problem is that my family and I are leaving San Francisco on TWA at eight o'clock in the morning (on the eighth

xx vright) ok you ah spoke with me earlier

oh ok is there can you check for any flights that um leave either Seattle or Portland and get into San Francisco by seven o'clock in the morning

xx ok if you leave from Portland the evening before meaning um Monday night (the

ok)

last flight of the day to San Francisco's at six thirty nine getting in at eight twenty so it wasn't any better it was worse (back

ok)

xx from Seattle let me take a look and see from Portland to San Francisco what the earliest flight would be and their earliest flight would have you arrive at eight oh seven a.m.

shoot

xx no it's not not great

looks like I'm going to miss that meeting ok so the only possiblity real romote one is seven fifty US Air flight huh

xx right or there was a seven forty five I think there's a United at seven forty five let me pull it back up again
xx ok um yeah the US Air's at seven fifty getting in at nine fifty or there's a United at seven forty five

ok

xx that gets in at nine thirty four

are there seats on both of those

xx mm hmm yeah they were both available the US Air's got less seats available than the United the United's wide open but the US Air um is selling out in the lower classes of service so there's st- still seats available but they're not quite as many as the United flight

ok can you make me a reservation on the US Air one
