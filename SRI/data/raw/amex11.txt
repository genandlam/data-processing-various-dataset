xx Good afternoon American Express this is A

xx [wanted to leave message, initially]

ok this is for B C's trip

xx [figuring out proper spelling]

xx oh C ok

and this is for his trip on ahh September September to ah Frankfurt Germany

xx mm hmm

ok now she said it had to be ticketed today for the one hundred one thousand
one hundred twenty four dollar flight

xx right

ok and he still is wait listed for that Lufthansa flight

xx right

now she said that if we don't ticket if we do ticket the eleven twenty four
today and that Lufthansa flight comes up you know la-

xx mmm hmmm

later and the- then we have to cancel that first fare

xx uh huh

there's a hundred dollar fine 

xx okay

and p- penalty plus ahh we pay for the going rate

xx yeah if ther- if it's going to be a higher rate

it's going to be a higher rate, ok now if we wait and the Lufthansa flight does
come up what rate do we get that eleven twenty four or something close to that

xx well, I don't know we can't predict what a fare is going to be if a fare,
xx if the computer's telling us that it's going to go higher we really can't
xx tell you what it's going to go up to

oh

xx um

for that Lufthansa flight (??

xx yeah,) it doesn't tell us what it's going to be tomorrow 

(oh

xx all) it's saying is the eleven twenty four will expire today

oh I see

xx now let me umm let me take a look at the rules possibly that would help me
xx out a little bit 
xx ok so the rules for let's see for the umm the fare quote from San
xx Francisco to Frankfurt on the TWA flight that he's on I'm trying to see
xx if that's the one it looks like that might be the one that's holding
xx whatever penalty let me take a look at it

that one, it's from Saint Louis right?

xx yeah let's see the that's the one that's holding the the hundred dollar
xx penalty

yeah

xx and the fourteen day advance purchase

yeah she told me that

xx ut dut dut dut dut dut duh.  umm it says ticket may be issued on or after,
xx yeah that looks like that's what it's um that's what it's holding is that
xx but I don't know  what umm  lemme look at the return and see if that
xx might have something to do with it

he's coming back on Lufthansa.

xx yeah I see that, let's see let's see what Lufthansa's fare quote says

You know what A I was wondering since we had uh we wait listed on the
Lufthansa when it does list when they list it ther- it is available why
can't he get that eleven twenty four whatever round
trip, you  know or it was maybe like eleven thirty or something

xx You mean if the if the the uh wait list clears?

yeah

xx we don't have any guarantee that it will clear

xx [ticketing policy]

xx um, actually you know I really don't know what uh what to tell you (umm

xx [wants other agent to call back]

ok) I think that'll I think the best thing to do is just ta- ge- go one way
on that other one to guarantee his flight

xx yeah

of eleven twenty four  ok

xx [will call back]

xx ok thanks a lot D

thank you, bye

xx Bye Bye
