xx American Express this is A

Hi A this is C.D. I'd like to make some reservations please

xx [recording notification]
no problem

xx what's the last name of the pass(enger

Speech Lab)do they care how we how we talk

xx I don't know um what what's the last name of the passenger

um I've two passengers F [spells name] and G [spells name]

xx what's the first name on F, H.F. and J.G.

xx ok I don't have a profile for F.

I have that information here

xx ok
xx let me get a generic profile one moment

?? he's what I guess you'd call a seldom flyer

xx that's [spells name]

that's correct

xx first name H.

right

xx ok his id number is
[digits]
xx [repeats digits]

xx and the charge number

charge number is [digits]

xx and the travel advance number

well I have two of them one for J which is [digits] ([digits]

xx ok wait) I need H.first

H. first

xx yeah

[digits]

xx [repeats digits]

xx [repeats same digits again]
and J.G.'s is

xx ok I don't need his yet

ok

xx I can only do one th- one profile at a time

I see

xx we do a generic profile and I have to implement all this first then I can go into another area and do the other person ok

will you be using this information to start a a profile for H.F.

xx no the only way we'll start a permanent profile a form has to be filled out and completed by him and signed

ok well

xx and that'll come back to us and then it's put in the computer

xx would you like to send it to me at E

um they have em at the travel office

xx ok

the forms

xx ok

xx because everything on this once he departs will completely leave our computer

all right

xx and your ex- extension at WWW

[digits]

xx [digits repeated] ok 
xx ok let me we have a profile for G., yes we do ok let me get his profile
for J.G.

ok

xx all right and the same charge number for him

yes

xx ok now his travel advance is

[digits]

xx ok and they're travelling to what city

I'm sorry

xx what city are they travelling to

to LA

xx on what date

on Tuesday I'm sorry on Monday the tenth

xx is that from San Francisco or San Jose

well I don't know that there is anything available the ideal would be from uh San Jose to uh Long Beach, but I have a feeling that fli- a flight won't be available direct ??

xx a- a and this is for the morning

yeah

xx well there's a United at eight fifty five arriving Long Beach at ten twenty

to to late uh it'd have to be at seven o'clock

xx ok that would be San Francisco

or seven thirty at the latest yeah, if it can't be San J- can it be San Francisco Long Beach

xx no it can't either ok they the service out of San Francisco is eight forty five is the first flight out

SFO to LAX then

xx ok I can get them San Jose LAX at seven is is San Jose closer to them er

mmmm

xx or should we just do San Francisco

that's hard to say maybe SFO's fine I have a feeling we're in Menlo Park so

xx oh ok

and I think they each live fairly close to here so probably SFO is better actually

xx ok there is a United US Air or American at seven

ok I think we had better price rates on the US Air didn't we or was it

xx pardon me

are the rates better on the US Air

xx um they're gong to be exactly the same I'm going to offer you what the lowest fare is it's not going to be on either of those carriers

oh 

xx the lowest airfare would be on Pan Am at six a.m. arriving seven twenty nine their airfare is fifty nine dollars everyone else is ninety nine dollars

departing at six a.m. huh

xx yeah six (a.m.

that's) that's a little cruel

xx pardon me

that's a little cruel they they have to be in LA at nine thirty and so um I think we'll stick with US Air number I think two nine oh eight it goes down

xx do you want to do does it matter to them do you know

what

xx uh carrier

no

xx can we put them on American

why

xx only because we're having a lot of seat problems I if I'm going to try and get them seats together

uh huh

xx we're having a lot of problems on the US Air seat maps so I I'm prbably not going to be able to I don't know if I can get them together because we we request through our computer specific seats but we're not always getting them but either United or American you know whatever we request pretty much we get
xx I mean it's up to you I I'll just you know book the US Air but the-  I don't think I'll get to seat them together on that

I don't know if they care if they sit together

xx ok

oh I feel like flipping a coin now

it's real frustrating ( he was ??

I was ?? )he the US Air flight was recommended by the manager I don't know if that makes

xx oh
xx well

any difference he travels a lot he may of said it because of some preference

I think they give really good service it's just that

xx pardon me

they give really good service

xx US Air

yeah

well let's go ahead and stick with it

xx ?? I hate their seat maps their just I mean they have seats that we you know we can't book the the way you look when you look at your map you have no idea what they are

oh

xx so when you request them you don't get responses at all on them for (days

so)like we won't know if it's how about non smoking and window aisle and all that stuff

xx yeahI'm I'm going to do that but I just what I have to do is like a generic request instead of asking for specific seats

I see

xx yeah I can see what seats are available but then they don't tell us which ones we can't some of them are blo- blacked out for restrictions or like ?? or whatever and we can't really tell on those on their seats maps are really I know that they said it's a real problem for themselves even their own agents trying to do their own seat assignments

xx ok let me just see here that's US Air two nine zero eight

departing at

xx seven a.m. on the tenth arriving eight twelve

xx and the return would be I believe US Air two seven seven seven departing at nine o'clock p.m.

ok what d- is that on the same day

xx same day 
ok you said seven p.m. 

xx mm hmm

xx ok that'd be US Air two five one four on the on the tenth

oh

they've changed their flight number
xx oh wait hold on a second, th- that's wrong hold on a moment ?? my computer here it's acting very strange
xx ok so that's US Air two seven seven seven on the tenth departing Los Angeles seven p.m. arriving San Francisco eight twenty p.m.
xx are we booking, can I put you on hold for a moment
sure

xx thanks

xx ok did we are we booking a car B

yes

xx under which name

G.

xx and do you know what size he uh what his profile if his profile says  ?? midsized car, it's what's in his profile should we do that

yeah uh mi- uh midsized mm hmm that's on the profile

xx yeah
ok

xx well from what these travellers are telling me there's only like a dollar difference between compact and midsized

oh ok

xx so I guess that's why they they?? of them have changed their profiles

xx all right so the airfare again like I said is umm one ninety eight total
now

xx that's ninety nine a person

pardon me

xx ninety nine a person

xx it's one- ninety nine each way on the airline

oh I see one ninety eight per person

xx one ninety eight per person

all right

xx and I guess

I'm sorry

xx I gotta offer what the lowest fares are so I have to see what the lowest fares returning are to
xx ok so the lowest airfare being declined is fifty nine each way on Pan Am

xx but leaving at six in the morning and

right 

and coming back when

xx coming back they have a six p.m. arriving seven thirty

which again is too early, too bad they didn't just schedule it an hour different maybe that's why it's so cheap

xx mm right so we just have we do we just have to offer it and notate that it was declined
xx ok so one eighteen will be what's declined one ninety nine is what's being paid and the other passenger wants what kind of seating

oh H.F.

xx yeah?? a profile

he would like a nonsmoking window

xx ok and these tickets will be sent over today is there anything else

yes um I need u- wh- let's see we've gotten the car in uh in at LAX from wh- wh- what rental agency

xx that's Hertz, Hertz midsized

Hertz midsized in J.'s name and um I need one more thing um H.F. does
not drive and needs uh some kind of arrangement from his home to the
airport so I believe there's a limo that goes directly by WWW  and
he's only about a block from there from here 

xx ok there's there's the WWW the um Airport Connection has a thirteen dollar it's thirteen dollars and they have a pickup right at WWW

ok

xx if he takes a limosine it's twenty nine each way

uh huh

xx to take a limosine
xx so does he want the Airport Connection that just picks up right at WWW

y- yeah I think I'll go ahead and commit him to that

xx ok

I don't think he wanted to to

spend twenty nine each way

to be committed to it but do you know this area

xx uh huh

or are you not in on this site 

xx no I'm not there but (um

yeah) ok

I just wasn't sure how far away this is or how he gets to work in the morning if he walks or what

xx well how far ?? where's he at

I'm just wondering how far he really is from c- from our site

xx I know where you're at but w- do you know where he's at

he's at the [numbers] block of [street name]

xx ok I know where [street name]'s at

is it

xx I'm trying to think [street name] runs right up to [street name] he's in Palo Alto

no Menlo Park

xx oh I didn't know that went down to Menlo Park

yeah I think he really is pretty close but uh I am committing him to
making it into WWW by like six in the morning or something
what time is the pickup

xx um they are ten minutes to the hour so it would have to be six fifty
xx no it can't be six fifty it'd have to be like five fifty they might
xx have a six let me see six fifteen I think they have like a six fifteen
xx that would get him there like a quarter to seven but I don't know if
xx that's like going to be enough time to check in   

well he won't have any luggage
xx a quarter to seven is a little close

xx ok let me let me call and I'll put him on the best one we can

yeah that

xx and see exactly what their times are

yeah that may not be appropriate I don't want him to both have to walk
all walk over to WWW and

xx oh

um you know be here
if the timing works for that then I think that'd be appropriate otherwise I think we should get the limo

xx ok you mean at six fifteen
if they have one at six fifteen he'll take that one
xx see the- they're not going to be at six thirty, cause it takes them about a half hour to get to the airport he wouldn't make his flight

uh huh six let's see

xx it's probably I think it's like ten to se- ten to six or then I think they then have another one at I'm not sure if they're just ten minutes to the hour it would be ten to six and that( would 

??) it's kind of tough to decide what would work cause I'm not a traveller and I their

xx yeah

are so many things I don't know about this but um what time do you think he should arrive at the airport if he has no luggage and wants to get on the seven o'clock flight

xx well if he he he sould at least arrive twenty minutes before the flight if not they can sell his seat to someone else

oh

xx so that's the problem

ok so he should he should be leaving here at six o'clock then it seems like

xx six he he would get there about six thirty right so (they leave

??)

ten to six

xx yeah if he's disembarking from the van at at six thirty then he's

yeah

xx finding his way to the check out window excetera

yeah

xx probably twenty till (so

xx e- even) the limosine if he takes the limosine a shared ride limosine
xx for twenty nine dollars there going to pick him up an hour and a half
xx prior to departure cause he's not going to be the only person in that
xx limosine   

the-

xx their going to go around and make pick ups 

uh huh

xx and then they're they're probably going to say five thirty they're
xx going to pick him up 

ok if it if it if it comes if there is one you are you saying there
definitely is one at ten to six 

xx there is one definitly ten to six, I'm not certain whether they have
xx them like after ten minutes after the hour I know they have them ten
xx minutes to the hour  

ok well I think the ten to six would be the most appropriate one

xx ok and does he is that round trip or just the one way

that is round trip

xx ok
xx ok I I'll go ahead and book that then that'll also be printed on his
xx itinery his pick up time 

um ok and how about exact location of pickup where does he need to be

xx I think building A let me find out (ok

ok)

xx ok it's building A is where they pick up

at the front steps

xx right

and what's the name of the company

xx it's Airport Connection

Airport Connection

xx uh huh

all right

xx ok

that's it thank you very much

xx thanks bye

bye bye

D.

xx all right and this is travel from what city to what city

um it's going to be uh well let's see I'd like to find out I'd like to
get the cheapest rates you can uh th-there's a flight an American
Airlines flight fourteen forty this is on the fifth of September that
goes from Orange County to Lake Tahoe via San Jose   

xx ok I don't let's see here I'm not sure they're operating on the fifth

beg your pardon

xx I show that schedule for American flight fourteen forty on the fifth
xx of December of nineteen ninety nine operating just San San Jose to San
xx Diego or let me check this one more time hold on a second  
xx  fourteen forty ok they must of changed all their flight numbers what
xx time was that departing I show 

well what I need to do is have someone go from Orange County to Lake
Tahoe they had a month ago fourteen forty started at six fifty four a.m.  

xx ok

and arrived in San Jose at eleven a.m.

xx ok they've changed um is he is he he's not going to stop in San J-,
xx he's not stopping in San Jose 

No he's going th- the most direct route to Or- to Lake Tahoe

xx ok so what they have now the flight number for December is five five
xx eight departing uh John Wayne at six fifty a.m. arriving Tahoe at nine
xx thirty five a.m. with a stop in San Jose  

ok

xx that's the schedule for December, and that is available what with the
xx return date that would be on that 

it'd be the same day uh that's that's in September right
xx the fifth of September

no tha- I I thought you said December
xx ok September that flight doesn't operate
xx ah let me see here,look at this morning's schedule here again
xx ok I can get that the fifth of September same flight number five five
xx eight and it's returning on the same day 

yes um what flights do you have returning to uh Orange county uh late afternoon

xx ok there's a direct flight at three thirty p.m. arriving six oh three
xx p.m. on American 

three thirty

xx p.m. and arrives uh John Wayne at six oh three p.m. with a stop in San
xx Jose  

what's the next one after that

xx well there going to be connections then

yeah ok I'm just thinking ??

xx um connection would be at four twenty five through San Francisco
xx arriving seven forty one p.m. 

I'm I'm thinking this is a minister that's going to be doing a wedding

xx oh I see

so it's a little important to have enough time 

xx sure

to let me think about that uh let's say the wedding would be around
eleven, three thirty get the three thirty flight please 

xx ok that would be American four seven nine on the fifth of September
xx departing Tahoe at three thirty p.m. and arriving John Wayne at six oh
xx three p.m.and let me check what the airfare is  
xx the airfare is two hundred and sixty four round trip

ok

xx on that they don't have any discounts without a Saturday night stay

that's that's ok now that's ah uh uh

xx that's a fully changable ticket also

fully changable ok

xx right

if he needs to change that or take a later flight he can do so

xx ok you do have a fl a flight through SF that's leaving at four twenty you said

xx right let me give you you want to write down what the schedule is on
xx that so if he needs to know that or 

uh I'll remember this one

xx ok that's a four twenty five arriving John Wayne at seven forty one
xx connects through San Francisco and let me see I don't think there's
xx anything after that  
xx well there is one later at six six seventeen 

no th th these two it'll be one or the other of these

xx ok

and l- let me schedule the three thirty one

xx ok so those are both confirmed do you know what his seating preference would be
xx for that aisle or window

xx American Express Travel this is A.

Hi this is B. C. WWW

xx uh huh

Do you still provide the personal service of making reservations for
WWW employees

for air reservation

xx uh huh

yes uh huh

xx ok and this is for personal travel

right airline reservations

xx uh huh

right uh huh

ok uh I actually am going to I think be  buying a ticket for someone
else and so I need to know some time periods can you help me with that 

xx sure what um

this p- this will be from Traver City, Michigan to SFO

xx what date is it for

the twenty eighth of August
and I'd like an open return but it would probably be something like
the uh nineteenth of September 

xx ok now if you have open return you're not going to get the lowest fare
xx the lowest require a confirmed return

oh I see

xx cause they're all subject to what days you're travelling and they have
xx to be confirmed with an open return uh you would be paying as high as
xx let me get that five hundred twenty four one way 

ooh 

so you have to have a confirmed return to get the lowest fares

xx ok that five hundred and twenty four dollars one way

one way
xx right uh huh

and if it's confirmed

xx I ne-  I need to know the dates, days (of the week

uh say)the nineteenth of September

ok
xx ok the lowest airfare would be three fifty three round trip that's a
xx non refundable non changable ticket, you have to make the reservation
xx er buy the ticket within twenty hours after reservations are made  
xx the very latest you can make reservations and buy tickets would be
xx fourteen days uh before departure and that would be subject to the
xx fares being available  

I see uh well gee that certaily a big difference in price (isn't it

xx right) right it's real restrictive too, so once you buy it they can't
xx change anything on it 
xx you use it or lose it

ok and there's nothing in between th- even with uh confirmed date that
would allow for a cancellation at anytime before the 

xx well not not on the only fare that allows you that is the five twenty four so if you have um there's a twenty five percent penalty ticket uh let me get that fare but you still have to use it round trip um you'd have to make your re- changes seven days before the new date or pay a five hundred dollar fare to come home

uhh

xx so all all of the fares are real restrictive now today so let me see what the twenty five percent penalty ticket would be

what airline is this

xx that's American or Northwest the two carriers service that

ok and and it's the same no matter if if we changed to United

xx same same re- they're all the same they all are competitive with one
xx another so the fares are the same 

ok so it's Northwest or American and it goes Traver City to Chicago O'Hara

xx well it depends of who you're using Northwest will go through Detroit
xx and United will go through actually United doesn't service, United is
xx no you can't use United  
xx they don't service Traver City so it would have to be American or Northwest

ok and American goes through Chicago

xx that's correct uh huh

ok well I guess I have some thinking to do and some questions to ask

xx ok thank you (very much for your help

your welcome) ok

xx bye

good bye
