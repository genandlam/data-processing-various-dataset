speaker: right uh huh
speaker: ok uh I actually am going to I think be  buying a ticket for someone
speaker: else and so I need to know some time periods can you help me with that 
Agent: sure what um
speaker: this p- this will be from Traver City, Michigan to SFO
Agent: what date is it for
speaker: the twenty eighth of August
speaker: and I'd like an open return but it would probably be something like
speaker: the uh nineteenth of September 
Agent: ok now if you have open return you're not going to get the lowest fare
Agent: the lowest require a confirmed return
speaker: oh I see
Agent: cause they're all subject to what days you're travelling and they have
Agent: to be confirmed with an open return uh you would be paying as high as
Agent: let me get that five hundred twenty four one way
speaker: ooh 
speaker: so you have to have a confirmed return to get the lowest fares
Agent: ok that five hundred and twenty four dollars one way
speaker: one way
Agent: right uh huh
speaker: and if it's confirmed
Agent: i ne- i need to know the dates, days (of the week
speaker: uh say)the nineteenth of September
speaker: ok
Agent: ok the lowest airfare would be three fifty three round trip that's a
Agent: non refundable non changable ticket, you have to make the reservation
Agent: er buy the ticket within twenty hours after reservations are made
Agent: the very latest you can make reservations and buy tickets would be
Agent: fourteen days uh before departure and that would be subject to the
Agent: fares being available
speaker: I see uh well gee that certaily a big difference in price (isn't it
Agent: right) right it's real restrictive too, so once you buy it they can't
Agent: change anything on it
Agent: you use it or lose it
speaker: ok and there's nothing in between th- even with uh confirmed date that
speaker: would allow for a cancellation at anytime before the 
Agent: well not not on the only fare that allows you that is the five twenty four so if you have um there's a twenty five percent penalty ticket uh let me get that fare but you still have to use it round trip um you'd have to make your re- changes seven days before the new date or pay a five hundred dollar fare to come home
speaker: uhh
Agent: so all all of the fares are real restrictive now today so let me see what the twenty five percent penalty ticket would be
speaker: what airline is this
Agent: that's american or northwest the two carriers service that
speaker: ok and and it's the same no matter if if we changed to United
Agent: same same re- they're all the same they all are competitive with one
Agent: another so the fares are the same
speaker: ok so it's Northwest or American and it goes Traver City to Chicago O'Hara
Agent: well it depends of who you're using northwest will go through detroit
Agent: and united will go through actually united doesn't service, united is
Agent: no you can't use united
Agent: they don't service traver city so it would have to be american or northwest
speaker: ok and American goes through Chicago
Agent: that's correct uh huh
speaker: ok well I guess I have some thinking to do and some questions to ask
Agent: ok thank you (very much for your help
speaker: your welcome) ok
Agent: bye
speaker: good bye
