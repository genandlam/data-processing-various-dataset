Agent: ok
speaker: I don't think he wanted to to
speaker: spend twenty nine each way
speaker: to be committed to it but do you know this area
Agent: uh huh
speaker: or are you not in on this site 
Agent: no i'm not there but (um
speaker: yeah) ok
speaker: I just wasn't sure how far away this is or how he gets to work in the morning if he walks or what
Agent: well how far ?? where's he at
speaker: I'm just wondering how far he really is from c- from our site
Agent: i know where you're at but w- do you know where he's at
speaker: he's at the [numbers] block of [street name]
Agent: ok i know where [street name]'s at
speaker: is it
Agent: i'm trying to think [street name] runs right up to [street name] he's in palo alto
speaker: no Menlo Park
Agent: oh i didn't know that went down to menlo park
speaker: yeah I think he really is pretty close but uh I am committing him to
speaker: making it into WWW by like six in the morning or something
speaker: what time is the pickup
Agent: um they are ten minutes to the hour so it would have to be six fifty
Agent: no it can't be six fifty it'd have to be like five fifty they might
Agent: have a six let me see six fifteen i think they have like a six fifteen
Agent: that would get him there like a quarter to seven but i don't know if
Agent: that's like going to be enough time to check in
speaker: well he won't have any luggage
Agent: a quarter to seven is a little close
Agent: ok let me let me call and i'll put him on the best one we can
speaker: yeah that
Agent: and see exactly what their times are
speaker: yeah that may not be appropriate I don't want him to both have to walk
speaker: all walk over to WWW and
Agent: oh
speaker: um you know be here
speaker: if the timing works for that then I think that'd be appropriate otherwise I think we should get the limo
Agent: ok you mean at six fifteen
speaker: if they have one at six fifteen he'll take that one
Agent: see the- they're not going to be at six thirty, cause it takes them about a half hour to get to the airport he wouldn't make his flight
speaker: uh huh six let's see
Agent: it's probably i think it's like ten to se- ten to six or then i think they then have another one at i'm not sure if they're just ten minutes to the hour it would be ten to six and that( would
speaker: ??) it's kind of tough to decide what would work cause I'm not a traveller and I their
Agent: yeah
speaker: are so many things I don't know about this but um what time do you think he should arrive at the airport if he has no luggage and wants to get on the seven o'clock flight
Agent: well if he he he sould at least arrive twenty minutes before the flight if not they can sell his seat to someone else
speaker: oh
Agent: so that's the problem
speaker: ok so he should he should be leaving here at six o'clock then it seems like
Agent: six he he would get there about six thirty right so (they leave
speaker: ??)
speaker: ten to six
Agent: yeah if he's disembarking from the van at at six thirty then he's
speaker: yeah
Agent: finding his way to the check out window excetera
speaker: yeah
Agent: probably twenty till (so
Agent: e- even) the limosine if he takes the limosine a shared ride limosine
Agent: for twenty nine dollars there going to pick him up an hour and a half
Agent: prior to departure cause he's not going to be the only person in that
Agent: limosine
speaker: the-
Agent: their going to go around and make pick ups
speaker: uh huh
Agent: and then they're they're probably going to say five thirty they're
Agent: going to pick him up
speaker: ok if it if it if it comes if there is one you are you saying there
speaker: definitely is one at ten to six 
Agent: there is one definitly ten to six, i'm not certain whether they have
Agent: them like after ten minutes after the hour i know they have them ten
Agent: minutes to the hour
speaker: ok well I think the ten to six would be the most appropriate one
Agent: ok and does he is that round trip or just the one way
speaker: that is round trip
Agent: ok
Agent: ok i i'll go ahead and book that then that'll also be printed on his
Agent: itinery his pick up time
