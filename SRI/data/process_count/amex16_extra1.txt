speaker: of October
Agent: ok
Agent: so let's take a look here. basic fare quote um prices can range anywhere
Agent: from a full coach fare of what one thousand seventy round trip
speaker: mm hmm
Agent: all the way down to a nonrefundable price of three hundred and fifty
Agent: eight dollars, it all depends on what's available at the time of his
Agent: booking and if he's going to be staying over a saturday night and if
Agent: he's going to purchase the tickets at least fourteen days prior to his
Agent: departure and willing to take a penalty fare
speaker: ok he will be leaving uh returning actually on the the Thursday after
Agent: ok so let me take a look here oh so he would be staying over a saturday
Agent: night. if he's leaving on the twenty eighth that is a saturday
speaker: uh huh
Agent: that would qualify him as long as he purchased the tickets fourteen days
Agent: prior to that departure date so he would have to umm have reservations made
Agent: and ticketed by the thirteenth of uh october
speaker: uh huh
Agent: again this is provided that the flights are available
speaker: ok
Agent: when he calls to make the reservation
Agent: um we can get him on a nonrefundable fare for you know a fairly good price
Agent: compared to one thousand seventy
speaker: ok
Agent: one thousand seventy is completely non penalty and that is the lowest non
Agent: penalty available in that market
Agent: oh it's non penalty and the nonrefundable is uh fourteen days prior to
Agent: departure and provided that the flights are available
Agent: available right and it's um that can be as low as um three fifty eight
Agent: and also three eighteen there's one it depends on what you know day
Agent: of the week we're looking at if he's gonna travel on a saturday three
Agent: fifty eight would apply, if he were travelling midweek still staying over
Agent: a saturday night there's the three eighteen fare then the fare could range
Agent: anywhere even higher than that three seventy eight for a twenty five
Agent: percent penalty fare travelling mid week
speaker: uh huh
Agent: also staying over a saturday night that's based on a seven day advanced
Agent: purchase or four eighteen round trip also twenty five percent penalty
Agent: also seven day advanced purchase with a saturday night stay over but
Agent: travelling on weekend days and that would be pretty much the uh the
Agent: breakdown
Agent: ok the four eighteen is the highest for the
Agent: for the discounted
Agent: the highest for the lowest
speaker: right right
Agent: and then it would jump from there to the full coach non penalty for one
Agent: thousand seventy
speaker: ok
Agent: (ok?
speaker: so) I could tell him a ra- p-pretty much a range between three twenty
speaker: five to four eighteen depending on the discount 
Agent: right
Agent: and the time (of uh when he places
Agent: and time of booking) and yeah
Agent: the actual reservation
speaker: right
speaker: ok but if he wants to go with the lowest non penalty coach he's gotta pay ??
Agent: the full coach yeah they don't offer unfortunately any discounts without
Agent: penalties for that market
speaker: ok
