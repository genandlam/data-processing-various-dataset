Agent: american express travel this is a, how can i help you
speaker: ah A I made a reservation earlier uh with uh B to Rochester uh
speaker: Minnesota and I'm trying to see what the fare would be if it was uh
speaker: round trip to Minneapolis rather than Rochester to see if there might
speaker: be a big difference.  he quoted me eleven forty four round trip
Agent: uh right uh do we have reservation right now we're holding?
speaker: uh yeah C [spelling]
Agent: and which departure date is this for?
speaker: this will be Sunday the uh twenty (fifth
Agent: twenty fifth) ok one moment.
Agent: ok so he's now san francisco rochester and you want me to check if he gets
speaker: well I'd like to see what would be uh to Minneapolis uh you know on an
speaker: unrestricted uh round trip ticket
Agent: round trip minneapolis?
speaker: uh huh
Agent: ok let me check that one moment
speaker: cause if it's a lot of uh difference then we may have him drive that
speaker: sixty miles or whatever
Agent: ok unrestricted the airfare would be eight fifty to go to minneapolis
Agent: so that is like a two hundred dollar savings
speaker: yeah right.  as a matter of fact almost uh yeah 
Agent: and he could, and he could, he could also take nonstops for that price
Agent: to minneapolis
speaker: yeah rather than having stopovers
Agent: it's almost a three hundred dollar savings
speaker: and it's two people going
Agent: it's two hundred ninety four per person savings
speaker: how about that.  I think we got to do that
Agent: ok
speaker: let's uh change it no the dates were looking at is uh Sunday the twenty fifth
Agent: uh huh
speaker: and um he could fly either out of San Jose or out of uh San Francisco
Agent: um if they would like to take nonstop service it would have to be san
Agent: francisco
speaker: Oh I see can you take take a quick look what the cost would be out of San Jose
speaker: one stop?  it goes through what Denver or someplace?
Agent: well it depends on the time we go. ah delta goes through salt lake
Agent: continental goes through denver
speaker: mm hmm
Agent: ah there's an american west flight through pheonix. they're probably going
Agent: to be the lowest let's see what their fare is
speaker: I sure hate to spend that much money, gosh.  especially only for two days
Agent: ok the airfare from san jose on connections would be eight ninety two
speaker: oh well no that wouldn't be smart then
Agent: ok so do we want to do out of uh san francisco a non stop then?
speaker: yeah right and what we'd like to do is to leave at a decent hour uh looks
speaker: like they can save time not having a stop um to get in you know not too
speaker: late in the evening let's say they leave around noon time or you know
speaker: give or take
Agent: ok
speaker: preferably a United if there is one
Agent: ok there's a united at one twenty five arrives seven oh four
speaker: uh huh well that sounds reasonable
Agent: ok and that would be united five seven four on the twenty fifth of june
speaker: and then the return is another story we need to get them back the very
speaker: latest Tuesday by noon but preferably they take an evening flight back,
speaker: so I guess the airline depends on what we can get back conveniently
Agent: um there's a nonstop on northwest at seven twenty arrives nine ten p.m.
Agent: let me see what united's schedule is
Agent: ok they don't have any nonstops in the evening
speaker: uh huh what's their latest nonstop
Agent: they only have one at eight twenty in the morning
speaker: oh well.  does it make a difference if they take a different airline
speaker: back on the on the um
Agent: no not at all
speaker: oh ok
Agent: so
speaker: what other choices have we Northwest is the one he likes the least.  I know
speaker: that
Agent: well if you want nonstop that's the only their, that's their hub so
speaker: oh ok
Agent: northwest is the only one that's going to fly aside from united's one flight
speaker: we'll take it 
Agent: ok
speaker: ok C
Agent: now they now they have the if they wanted to go earlier in the day i don't
Agent: know if they can do it there's a two forty five on northwest arriving
Agent: four thirty five
speaker: uh that doesn't sound realistic 
Agent: ok so we'll do the seven twenty p.m.
speaker: uh huh
speaker: so that's the twenty sixth right?
Agent: well you said tuesday that's the twenty seventh
speaker: oh I I'm sorry uh it would have to be Monday evening then
Agent: oh it was suppose to be on monday?
speaker: yeah
Agent: ok let me do this for you here. ok now if now on the twenty seventh
Agent: there was a flight that was sold out that i didn't tell you about but
Agent: on the twenty sixth it's available at five fifty
speaker: oh there you go
Agent: do you want to do that one?
speaker: yes uh huh
Agent: ok
speaker: five fifty p.m. and that's also N-
Agent: that's northwest three five seven on the twenty sixth monday (departing
speaker: right) uh huh
Agent: minneapolis five fifty arriving seven forty three
speaker: seven forty three ok
Agent: you said there's another person travelling?
speaker: uh yeah the uh second person is D, [spelling] F
Agent: let me change his flight. ok so he's confirmed on the same flight
speaker: ok
speaker: Ah A what's that United flight going out number?
Agent: ok that is united fou- five seven four on the twenty fifth
speaker: ok
Agent: and that departs one twenty five p.m. arrives minneapolis seven oh four p.m.
speaker: ok
Agent: ok if he's going to upgrade we need to know what kind of certificate he's
Agent: using
speaker: right
Agent: the premieres can only upgrade within twenty four hours of the flight and
Agent: executive premieres are the only ones that can upgrade within uh three days
Agent: of the flight
speaker: oh ok
Agent: so it depends on what kind of status he has with united
