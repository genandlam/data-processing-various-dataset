speaker1: why can't we?
speaker2: not in your nature.
speaker1: what do you know about my nature?
speaker2: i'm talking about your people, not you.
speaker1: what the do you know about my people?

speaker1: shut the up, would you?
speaker2: and you know the funny thing?
speaker1: no, what's the funny thing?
speaker2: i didn't even fancy her.

speaker1: didn't look like that to me... 
speaker2: she's not my type.
speaker2: c'mere.
speaker1: no.
speaker2: ah, c'mere. i want to show you something.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: my inside pocket.
speaker2: take out the wallet.
speaker2: open it.
speaker2: inside. there's a picture.
speaker2: no, not that one. there's another.
speaker2: now she's my type.

speaker1: she'd be anyone's type. 
speaker2: don't you think of it,
speaker1: why not?
speaker2: she's mine. anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
speaker1: no?
speaker2: absolutely not.
speaker1: she your wife?
speaker2: suppose you could say that.
speaker1: you make a nice couple.
speaker2: don't i know it.
speaker1: so what were you around for, then?
speaker2: you set me up. that --
speaker1: she's a friend of mine
speaker2: okay. that nice lady. meets me in a bar. i'm saying what the am i doing here anyway. she buys me a drink. she holds my hand. i'm looking at her saying i don't like you, but what the maybe i'll get to understand.
speaker1: what?

speaker1: what the am i doing here. 
speaker2: what the were you doing here?
speaker1: i got sent.
speaker2: you could have said no.
speaker1: can't. once i signed up.
speaker2: why did you sign up?
speaker1: it was a job. so i get sent to the only place in the world they call you to your face.
speaker2: shouldn't take it personally.
speaker1: "go back to your banana tree, nigger." no use telling them i came from tottenham.
speaker2: and you play cricket?.
speaker1: best game in the world.
speaker2: ever see hurling?
speaker1: that game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
speaker2: best game in the world.
speaker1: never.
speaker2: the fastest.

speaker1: well, in antigua cricket's the black man's game. the kids play it from the age of two. my daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. then we moved to tottenham and it was something different. 
speaker2: how different?
speaker1: toffs' game there. but not at home. .
speaker1: so when you come to shoot me, paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
speaker2: i'll bear that in mind.
speaker2: and by the way, it's not paddy. it's fergus.
speaker1: nice to meet you, fergus.
speaker2: my pleasure, jody

speaker1: take it easy, now. just go slow. down by that tree. 
speaker2: tree.
speaker2: you've got to loosen my hands.

speaker1: can't. 
speaker2: well then, you're going to have to take my out for me, aren t you?
speaker2: come on, man, i'm going to wet my pants! fergus turns him around and unzips his fly.
speaker2: take the out, man, i'm dying -- fergus takes jody's out.
speaker2: i gotta lean forward or i'll dribble all over myself. will you hold my hands for me.
speaker2: now, that was worth waiting for.
speaker1: hurry up, would you?
speaker2: these things take time, fergus.
speaker2: it's amazing how these small details take on such importance... he steps back.
speaker2: now put it back in.
speaker1: give us a break.

speaker1: i can't do it! it's only a piece of meat. for fuck's sake, it's got no major diseases. 
speaker1: thank you. i had a case of the clap two years ago. crabs in ulster. but all in all it's served me well.
speaker2: shut up, would you?
speaker1: i'm sorry. didn't mean to offend you, fergus.
speaker1: fergus?
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: thanks. i know that wasn't easy for you. he begins to laugh.
speaker2: the pleasure was all mine.

speaker1: what the is this? 
speaker2: it's nothing. he's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
speaker1: you're on duty. keep your mouth shut. go in and get some sleep. fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door.
speaker3: yeah. get some sleep.

speaker1: did he talk? 
speaker1: didn't make you laugh?
speaker1: here. have some breakfast.

speaker1: good morning, fergus? 
speaker2: so he knows your name?
speaker3: i told him.
speaker2: are you all there?
speaker3: back in a minute, jody

speaker1: you'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: and do you know why?
speaker2: why?
speaker1: because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.

speaker1: it happens. y'see, there's two kinds of people. those who give and those who take. 
speaker1: ah, take the thing off, man.
speaker1: it's okay. i understand. don't mind if i prattle on, do you? fergus shakes his head and says nothing.
speaker1: i will take it by your silence that you don't.
speaker1: two types, fergus. the scorpion and the frog. ever heard of them?
speaker1: scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim. goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride. frog says, "if i give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me." scorpion replies, "it would not be in my interest to sting you since as i'll be on your back we both would drown." frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal. takes the scorpion on his back. braves the waters. halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. and as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "why did you sting me, mr. scorpion, for now we both will drown?" scorpion replies, "i can't help it, it's in my nature." jody chuckles under his hood.

speaker1: so what's that supposed to mean? 
speaker2: means what it says. the scorpion does what is in his nature. take off the hood, man.
speaker1: why?
speaker2: 'cause you're kind. it's in your nature.
speaker2: see? i was right about you.
speaker1: don't be so sure.
speaker2: jody's always right.
speaker2: where would you most like to be now, man?
speaker1: doesn't matter where.
speaker2: come on, man. if this was all over.
speaker1: having a pint in the rock.
speaker2: you lack imagination, fergus. think of something more alluring.
speaker1: like what?
speaker2: like having a pint in the metro -- fergus laughs.

speaker1: having two pints in the rock. 
speaker2: having a pint in the metro, and dil's having a margarita.
speaker1: who's dil?
speaker2: my special friend.
speaker1: oh, yeah.
speaker2: we got simple tastes, you and me.
speaker1: the best.
speaker2: but you fellas never get a break, do you?
speaker1: do you?
speaker2: oh, yes. we do a tour of duty and we're finished. but you guys are never finished, are you?
speaker1: we don't look on it like that.
speaker2: i've often wondered how you do it.
speaker1: depends on what you believe in.
speaker2: what do you believe in?
speaker1: that you guys shouldn't be here.
speaker2: it's as simple as that?
speaker1: yes.
speaker3: jude enters.
speaker4: put that thing back on him, fergus.
speaker1: he's hot.
speaker4: doesn't matter if he's hot. just cover the up.
speaker2: have you no feelings, woman?
speaker4: you shut your face -- she pulls the hood down over him.
speaker4: you're heading for trouble, fergus --
speaker2: he's a good soldier, jude.
speaker4: i said shut the up --
speaker2: he believes in the future --

speaker1: is it bad? 
speaker2: no. not bad. women are trouble, you know that, fergus?
speaker1: i didn't.
speaker2: some kinds of women are...

speaker1: she can't help it. 
speaker2: dil wasn't trouble. no trouble at all.
speaker1: you liked her?
speaker2: present tense, please. love her. whatever she is. i'm thinking of her now, fergus. will you think of her too?
speaker1: don't know her.
speaker2: want you to do something, fergus.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: if they kill me --
speaker1: don't think that way.
speaker2: but they will. as sure as night follows day. they have to. i want you to find her out. tell her i was thinking of her.
speaker2: see if she's all right.
speaker1: i don't know her.
speaker2: take her picture. c'mere.
speaker2: take it. in the inside pocket.

speaker1: take the whole lot. i won't need it. 
speaker2: i told you not to talk that way --
speaker1: go to millie's hair salon in spitalfields. take her to the metro for a margarita. don't have to tell her who you are. just tell her jody was thinking --
speaker2: stop it --
speaker3: volunteer?
speaker3: we need you inside.
speaker3: we've had word. they've used every trick in the book on him. he's starting to talk. you're going to have to do it in the morning.
speaker3: you ok about that?
speaker2: i'm a volunteer, am n't i?
speaker3: good. i was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
speaker4: not the only one --

speaker1: shut up, jude. you best get some sleep tonight, fergus. 
speaker2: peter.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
speaker3: you're crazy. don't let him, peter.
speaker1: shut the up, jude.
speaker1: why do you want to do that for?
speaker2: would make me feel better about it.
speaker1: you sure about that?
speaker2: i'm sure.
speaker1: okay. you're a good man, fergus.
speaker2: don't.
speaker4: i'm sorry.
speaker5: the crying stops.
speaker4: help me.
speaker2: how can i?
speaker4: i don't know. just help me. give me a cigarette.
speaker4: don't even smoke, you know that? it just seemed the right thing to do.
speaker2: go to sleep now.
speaker4: i don't want to sleep. tell me something.
speaker2: what?
speaker4: a story.
speaker2: like the one about the frog?
speaker4: and the scorpion. no. tell me anything.
speaker2: when i was a child...
speaker4: yeah?
speaker2: i thought as a child. but when i became a man i put away childish things...
speaker4: what does that mean?

speaker1: nothing. 
speaker2: tell me something, anything.
speaker2: not a lot of use, are you, fergus?
speaker1: me? no, i'm not good for much...

speaker1: stand up, now -- 
speaker2: i wish to say on behalf of the irish republican army -- fergus turns with sudden fierceness.
speaker1: leave him be -- he pulls jody through the fields.

speaker1: take the hood off, fergus -- 
speaker2: no.

speaker1: i want to see a bit. please, please. don't make me die like an animal. 
speaker1: i'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, fergus?
speaker2: why?
speaker1: cause you're my friend. and i want you to go to the metro --
speaker2: stop that talk now --
speaker1: hurling's a fast game, isn't it, fergus?
speaker2: the fastest.
speaker1: faster than cricket?
speaker2: cricket's in the halfpenny place.
speaker1: so if i ran now, there's no way i'd beat you, is there?
speaker2: you won't run.
speaker1: but if i did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --

speaker1: fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs. 
speaker2: you stupid --
speaker3: what you say, faster?
speaker2: i said you -- stop --
speaker3: got to catch me first --

speaker1: you'll notice i've asked you nothing. 
speaker2: that's wise, tommy.
speaker1: all right, then. i like to be wise.
speaker1: so what do you need, fergus?
speaker2: need to go across the water.

speaker1: never said a truer word.
speaker1: see, i was always best looking after someone. must be something in the genes.
speaker2: must be.
speaker1: and the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. and even when you were throwing up, i could tell you cared.

speaker1: you could? 
speaker2: do you care, jimmy?
speaker1: sure i do.
speaker2: you mean that?
speaker1: yeah. i care, dil.

speaker3: whatever it is she does for you.
speaker1: if i was her i'd consider that an insult.
speaker3: consider it how you like. just get that tart out of here. fergus stands up suddenly. he speaks quietly.
speaker1: did you ever pick your teeth up with broken fingers?

speaker1: what's that supposed to mean? 
speaker2: it's a simple question.
speaker2: come on, dear.
speaker3: he didn't answer, honey -- fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.
speaker4: sorry about that, mr. deveroux.
speaker3: my, oh my, jimmy, how gallant.
speaker2: shut up.
speaker3: made me feel all funny inside.
speaker2: i said stop it.
speaker3: ask me to meet you again, jimmy.
speaker2: you think that's wise?
speaker3: nothing's wise.
speaker2: i didn't mean to hit you.
speaker3: i know that.

speaker1: kind of liked you as a girl. 
speaker2: that's a start.
speaker1: so i'm sorry.

speaker1: whenever. tonight.

speaker1: do they know? 
speaker2: know what, honey?
speaker1: know what i didn't know. and don't call me that.

speaker2: so they do know.
speaker1: all right, they do.
speaker2: don't.
speaker1: sorry.
speaker2: i should have known, shouldn't i?
speaker1: probably.
speaker2: kind of wish i didn't.
speaker1: you can always pretend.
speaker2: that's true.... your soldier knew, didn't he?
speaker1: absolutely.
speaker2: won't be quite the same though, will it?
speaker1: are you pretending yet?
speaker2: i'm working on it.
speaker2: there's dave. he knew too.
speaker1: stop it, jimmy.

speaker1: am i becoming repetitious? 
speaker2: a little.
speaker1: sorry.
speaker1: don't ask me in.
speaker2: please, jimmy.
speaker1: no. can't pretend that much.
speaker2: i miss you, jimmy.
speaker1: should have stayed a girl.
speaker2: don't be cruel.
speaker1: okay. be a good girl and go inside.
speaker2: only if you kiss me.
speaker1: happy now?
speaker2: delirious.

speaker1: you vanished. 
speaker1: what was it, fergus? did you blow the gaff on us or did you just up?
speaker2: leave me alone, jude.
speaker1: no. that's the last thing i'll do. you never asked what happened.
speaker2: i heard.
speaker1: eddie and tinker died.
speaker2: i know.
speaker1: maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. no thanks to you.... what you think of the hair?
speaker2: suits you.
speaker1: aye, i was sick of being blond. needed a tougher look, if you know what i mean.
speaker1: me, fergus.
speaker1: am i to take it that's a no?
speaker3: he says nothing.
speaker1: we had a court-martial in your absence. they wanted to put a bullet in your head. i pleaded for clemency. said we should find out what happened first. so what did happen?
speaker2: he ran. i couldn't shoot him in the back. i tried to catch him. he made it to the road and got hit by a saracen.
speaker1: so you did up.
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: but you know what the thing is, fergus?
speaker2: no, what is the thing?
speaker1: you vanished quite effectively. became mister nobody. and you've no idea how useful that could be.
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: we've got some plans here. and we'll need a mister nobody to execute them.
speaker2: no way, jude. i'm out.
speaker1: you're never out, fergus.
speaker1: maybe you don't care whether you die or not. but consider the girl, fergus. the wee black chick.

speaker1: leave her out of this. 
speaker2: fergus, you're a walking cliche. you know we won't leave her out of this. but i'm glad to see you care.
speaker2: and i must admit i'm curious.
speaker1: what the do you know, jude?
speaker2: you tell me, boy -- fergus stares at her. then says quietly:
speaker1: she's nobody. she likes me.
speaker2: so i suppose a is out of the question. keep your head down, fergus. no sudden moves. and not a whisper to her. you'll be hearing from us.
speaker2: keep the faith.

speaker1: he your boyfriend? 
speaker1: lucky you.

speaker1: carnations. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: he'd bring me carnations.
speaker2: so i got it wrong, then.
speaker1: not at all, honey.
speaker2: don't.
speaker1: okay.
speaker2: come on.
speaker1: why, honey --
speaker2: come on.
speaker1: you gonna tell me why?
speaker2: no.
speaker3: as they pass jude, she smiles.
speaker1: what's wrong, jimmy? tell me what's wrong

speaker1: you gonna tell me what it is? a figure sitting down at the bar. it is jude. 
speaker2: what was it?
speaker1: you know her, jimmy?
speaker2: jimmy, is it? do you know me, jimmy?

speaker1: don't go looking for it, dil. 
speaker2: well, maybe you'll get lucky. someday.
speaker1: a bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, jimmy?
speaker2: a girl has to have a bit of glamour.
speaker1: absolutely. long as she can keep it. isn't that right, james...
speaker2: it's her, isn't it?
speaker3: what's her?
speaker2: she's the thing you had to tell me.
speaker3: kind of.
speaker2: i'm sorry, you know that? i'm really sorry.
speaker2: you see that, col?
speaker4: saw it, dil.
speaker2: it, is what i say.
speaker4: yeah. it, dil.
speaker2: men, col --

speaker1: 'em. 
speaker2: and you, jimmy --
speaker1: you could always make it up to her.
speaker3: how?
speaker1: when a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
speaker3: she's not a girl, col --
speaker1: whatever you say.

speaker1: she went that way -- jude grabs his arm. 
speaker1: but you come with me.

speaker1: so it was you all the time. 
speaker2: who'd you think it was?
speaker1: i thought it was dave.
speaker2: and who's dave when he's at home?
speaker1: he's at home.
speaker2: should blow you away, you know that?
speaker1: i know that.
speaker2: i'm getting emotional. and i don't want to get emotional -- you understand, hennessy?
speaker1: i understand.

speaker2: definitely unusual.
speaker1: and who is she?
speaker2: just a girl.
speaker1: and you know what'll happen if you up again, don't you?
speaker2: aye, i do, peter.
speaker1: good.

speaker1: so what do you think that is, hennessy? 
speaker2: a hotel?
speaker1: it's a knocking-shop. tres discreet, huh? he visits his ladies on tuesday and thursday nights and saturday mornings. his security's in the car beyond.
speaker2: who is he?
speaker1: doesn't matter who he is. he is what we would call a legitimate target.

speaker1: thank for that. 
speaker2: you being cynical, hennessy?
speaker1: hope not.
speaker2: good. so what do you think?
speaker1: whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. and i presume you can't get in.
speaker2: right.
speaker1: so it's on the street.
speaker2: right.
speaker1: kind of suicide, isn't it?
speaker1: but, then, i don't have a choice.
speaker3: och, you do, fergie.

speaker4: jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.
speaker2: you were made for this.

speaker2: perfect.
speaker1: and what happens then?
speaker2: we'll be on the other side. we'll move when you do.
speaker1: and what if you don't?
speaker2: fergus, i think you don't trust me.
