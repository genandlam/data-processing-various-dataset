speaker3: how about a lift, mister?
speaker2: can't you see that sticker?
speaker3: sure i see it. but a good guy don't pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck.
speaker2: scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend.
speaker2: goin' far?
speaker3: just a few miles. i'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
speaker2: lookin' for a job?
speaker3: no, my old man got a place, forty acres. he's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
speaker2: oh!
speaker2: been doin' a job?
speaker3: yeah.

speaker2: get to what?
speaker3: you know what i mean. you been givin' me a goin' over ever since i got in. whyn't you go on and ask me where i been?
speaker2: i don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
speaker3: naw--not much!
speaker2: i stay in my own yard.
speaker3: listen. that big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. but i ain't keepin' it a secret. i been in the penitentiary. been there four years. like to know anything else?
speaker2: you ain't got to get sore.
speaker3: go ahead. ask me anything you want.
speaker2: i didn't mean nothing.
speaker3: me neither. i'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all. see that road up ahead?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker3: that's where i get off.
speaker3: you're about to bust to know what i done, ain't you? well, i ain't a guy to let you down. homicide!
speaker2: i never asked you!
speaker4: mmmmm he's my saviour. mmmmm my saviour, mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now. howdy, friend.
speaker3: howdy.
speaker4: say, ain't you young tom joad--ol' tom's boy?
speaker3: yeah. on my way home now.
speaker4: well, i do declare! i baptized you, son.
speaker3: why, you're the preacher!
speaker4: used to be. not no more. i lost the call. but boy, i sure used to have it! i'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners i pretty near drowned half of 'em! but not no more. i lost the sperit.
speaker3: pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
speaker4: i got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. i ain't so sure o' things.
speaker3: maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
speaker4: at my meetin's i used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. then, i'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. i'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. next time, do it again. i figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
speaker3: i never let one go by me when i could catch her.
speaker4: but you wasn't a preacher. a girl was just a girl to you. but to me they was holy vessels. i was savin' their souls. i ast myself--what is this call, the holy sperit? maybe that's love. why, i love everybody so much i'm fit to bust sometimes! so maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. there's just what people do. some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. but that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
speaker3: have a little snort?
speaker4: course i'll say grace if somebody sets out the food-- --but my heart ain't in it. nice drinkin' liquor.
speaker3: ought to be. that's fact'ry liquor. cost me a buck.
speaker4: been out travelin' around?
speaker3: didn't you hear? it was in the papers.
speaker4: no, i never. what?
speaker3: i been in the penitentiary for four years.
speaker4: excuse me for asking.
speaker3: i don't mind any more. i'd do what i done again. i killed a guy at a dance. we was drunk. he got a knife in me and i laid him out with a shovel. knocked his head plumb to squash.
speaker4: and you ain't ashamed?
speaker3: he had a knife in me. that's why they only gave me seven years. got out in four--parole.
speaker4: ain't you seen your folks since then?
speaker3: no, but i aim to before sundown. gettin' kind of excited about it, too. which way you going?
speaker4: it don't matter. ever since i lost the sperit it looks like i just as soon go one way as the other. i'll go your way.
speaker3: maybe ma'll have pork for supper. i ain't had pork but four times in four years--every christmas.
speaker4: i'll be glad to see you pa. last time i seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the holy sperit i ever seen. he go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. they was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' i give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more holy sperit in your pa after that.
speaker3: lissen. this wind's fixin't to do somepin'!
speaker4: shore it is. it always is, this time a year.
speaker4: is it fur?
speaker3: just around that next bend.
speaker4: your granma was a great one, too. the third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
speaker3: that's our place.
speaker5: ma?... pa?... ain't nobody here? somepin's happened.
speaker6: you got a match?
speaker5: there was some pieces of candle always on a shelf.
speaker3: they're all gone--or dead.
speaker4: they never wrote you nothing?
speaker3: no. they wasn't people to write.
speaker3: this was ma's. had 'em for years.
speaker3: this used to be mine. i give it to grampa when i went away. you reckon they could be dead?
speaker4: i never heard nothin' about it.
speaker7: tommy?
speaker3: muley! where's my folks, muley?
speaker7: they gone.
speaker3: i know that! but where they gone?
speaker3: this is muley graves. you remember the preacher, don't you?
speaker4: i ain't no preacher anymore.
speaker3: all right, you remember the man then.
speaker8: glad to see you again. glad to see you.
speaker3: now where is my folks?
speaker7: gone-- --over to your uncle john's. the whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. but they can't stay there either, because john's got his notice to get off.
speaker3: but what's happened? how come they got to get off? we been here fifty years--same place.
speaker7: ever'body got to get off. ever'body leavin', goin' to california. my folks, your folks, ever'body's folks. ever'body but me. i ain't gettin' off.
speaker3: but who done it?
speaker7: listen! that's some of what done it--the dusters. started it, anyway. blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
speaker3: are you crazy?
speaker7: some say i am. you want to hear what happened?
speaker3: that's what i asked you, ain't it?
speaker7: the way it happens--the way it happened to me--the man come one day...
speaker9: fact of the matter, muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. it don't even break even, much less show a profit. one man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. you just pay him a wage and take all the crop.
speaker7: but we couldn't do on any less'n what our share is now. the chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
speaker9: i can't help that. all i know is i got my orders. they told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what i'm telling you. muley stands in anger. the two younger men pattern after him.
speaker7: you mean get off my own land?
speaker9: now don't go blaming me. it ain't my fault.
speaker10: whose fault is it?
speaker9: you know who owns the land--the shawnee land and cattle company.
speaker7: who's the shawnee land and cattle comp'ny?
speaker9: it ain't nobody. it's a company.
speaker10: they got a pres'dent, ain't they? they got somebody that knows what a shotgun's for, ain't they?
speaker9: but it ain't his fault, because the bank tells him what to do.
speaker10: all right. where's the bank?
speaker9: tulsa. but what's the use of picking on him? he ain't anything but the manager, and half crazy hisself, trying to keep up with his orders from the east!
speaker7: then who do we shoot?
speaker9: brother, i don't know. if i did i'd tell you. but i just don't know who's to blame!
speaker7: well, i'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't nobody going to push me off my land! grampa took up this land seventy years ago. my pa was born here. we was all born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. and that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! so just come on and try to push me off! the scene dissolves to the back room. the sound of the storm is heard again as tom and casy watch muley.
speaker3: well?
speaker7: they come. they come and pushed me off.
speaker7: they come with the cats.
speaker5: the what?
speaker7: the cats--the caterpillar tractors.
speaker11: and for ever' one of 'em ten-fifteen families gets throwed outa their homes--one hundred folks with no place to live but on the road. the rances, the perrys, the peterses, the joadses--one after another they got throwed out. half the folks you and me know--throwed right out into the road. the one that got me come a month ago.
speaker7: i tol' you!
speaker7: why, you're joe davis's boy!
speaker12: i don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
speaker7: then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
speaker12: for three dollars a day, that's what i'm doin' it for. i got two little kids. i got a wife and my wife's mother. them people got to eat. fust and on'y thing i got to think about is my own folks. what happens to other folks is their lookout.
speaker7: but this is my land , son. don't you understand?
speaker12: used to be your land. b'longs to the comp'ny now.
speaker13: what's he fixin' to do, ma?
speaker14: hush!
speaker7: have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat i'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
speaker15: don't! please don't!
speaker7: i'm tellin' you!
speaker7: what was the use. he was right. there wasn't a thing in the world i could do about it.
speaker3: but it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
speaker7: the rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but i couldn't leave. somepin' wouldn't let me. so now i just wander around. sleep wherever i am. i used to tell myself i was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. but i knowed that wan't true. there ain't nothin' to look out for. and ain't nobody comin' back. they're gone-- and me, i'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world i am.
speaker7: you think i'm touched.
speaker4: no. you're lonely--but you ain't touched.
speaker7: it don't matter. if i'm touched, i'm touched, and that's all there is to it.
speaker3: what i can't understand is my folks takin' it! like ma! i seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken. she aimed to go for him with an ax she had in the other hand but she got mixed up and forgot which hand was which and when she got through with that peddler all she had left was two chicken legs.
speaker7: just a plain 'ol graveyard ghost, that's all.
speaker3: she's settlin'.
speaker4: what you figger to do?
speaker3: it's hard to say. stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to uncle john's, i reckon. after that i don't know.
speaker7: listen! that's them! them lights! come on, we got to hide out!
speaker3: hide out for what? we ain't doin' nothin'.
speaker7: you're trespassin' ! it ain't you lan' no more! an' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
speaker4: come on, tom. you're on parole.
speaker7: all you got to do is lay down an' watch.
speaker3: won't they come out here?
speaker16: muley? he ain't here. the car moves on.
speaker3: anybody ever 'tol me i'd be hidin' out on my own place...! he whistles, as the scene fades out.
speaker17: lord, make us thankful for what we are about to receive, for his sake. amen.
speaker18: i seen you!--you et durin' grace!
speaker19: ain't he messy though!
speaker18: i seen him!--gobblin' away like an ole pig!
speaker20: whyn't you keep your eyes shet durin' grace, you ole...
speaker21: what's it say again?

speaker3: we're goin' to california, ain't we? awright then, let's go to california.
speaker7: that don't sound like you, ma. you never was like that before.
speaker3: i never had my house pushed over before. i never had my fambly stuck out on the road. i never had to lose... ever'thing i had in life.

speaker1: ain't a-goin'... ain't a-goin'... 
speaker2: 's all right, grampa. you just kind a tar'd, that's all. somebody fix a pallet.
speaker3: this here is william james joad, dyed of a stroke, old old man. his folkes bured him becaws they got no money to pay for funerls. nobody kilt him. jus a stroke an he dyed.
speaker2: i figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt. lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
speaker4: not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
speaker2: casy, won't you say a few words?
speaker5: i ain't no more a preacher, you know.
speaker2: we know. but ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
speaker5: i'll say 'em--an' make it short. this here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. i don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "all that lives is holy." but i wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. if i was to pray i'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. he's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it.
speaker6: amen.
speaker7: tommy.
speaker8: what is it, ma?
speaker7: wasn't that the state line we just passed?
speaker2: yes'm, that was it.
speaker7: your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. says they'll send you up again.
speaker2: forget it, ma. i got her figgered out. long as i keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. all i gotta do is keep my nose clean.
speaker7: maybe they got crimes in california we don't know about. crimes we don't even know is crimes.
speaker2: forget it, ma. jus' think about the nice things out there. think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
speaker9: i gotta git out!
speaker2: first gas station, granma--
speaker9: i gotta git out , i tell ya! i gotta git out !
speaker2: awright! awright!
speaker2: they shore don't waste no time! take her out.
speaker10: save your strength, lady. get goin', buddy. no campin' here.
speaker2: we ain't campin'. we jus' stoppin' a minute--
speaker10: lissen, i heard that before--
speaker9: i tell ya i gotta git out!
speaker2: she's kinda ol'--
speaker9: i tell ya--
speaker10: okay, okay!
speaker11: ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
speaker7: now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
speaker11: sometimes i'm all jumpy inside.
speaker7: well, can't nobody get through nine months without sorrow.
speaker11: but will it--hurt the baby?
speaker7: they use' to be a sayin': a chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. an' another: born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. that's the way i always heard it.
speaker11: you don't ever get scairt, do you, ma?
speaker7: sometimes. a little. only it ain't scairt so much. it's just waitin' an' wonderin'. but when sump'n happens that i got to do sump'n-- --i'll do it.
speaker11: don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in california like we think?
speaker7: no. no, it don't. i can't do that. i can't let m'self. all i can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. they'd all get upset if i done anymore 'n that. they all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that. that's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together. as the music ends we see a group on the porch steps. the men murmur approbation of connie's playing.
speaker4: thas my son-in-law.
speaker12: sings real nice. what state y'all from?
speaker4: oklahoma. had us a farm there, share- croppin'.
speaker2: till the tractors druv us out.
speaker12: we from arkansas. i had me a store there, kind of general notions store, but when the farms went the store went too. nice a little as you ever saw. i shore did hate to give it up.
speaker4: wal, y'cain't tell. i figure when we git out there an' git work an' maybe git us a piece a growin' lan' near water it might not be so bad at that.
speaker13: thas right... payin' good wages, i hear... ever'body got work out there... can't be no worse...
speaker14: you folks must have a pot a money.
speaker14: good wages, eh! pickin' oranges an' peaches?
speaker4: we gonna take whatever they got.
speaker2: what's so funny about it?
speaker14: what's so funny about it? i just been out there! i been an' seen it! an' i'm goin' back to starve-- because i ruther starve all over at once!
speaker4: whatta you think you're talkin' about? i got a han'bill here says good wages, an' i seen it in the papers they need pickers!
speaker14: awright, go on! ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
speaker4: but what about this?
speaker14: i ain't gonna fret you. go on!

speaker2: never seen such tough mountains. this here's a murder country, just the bones of a country. wonder if we'll ever get in a place where folks can live 'thout fightin' hard scrabble an' rock. sometimes you get to thinkin' they ain't no such country.

speaker10: don't you ever tell i told.
speaker9: what is it?
speaker10: well, the association don't like the government camps. can't get a deputy in there. can't arrest a man without a warrant. but if there was a big fight, and maybe shooting--a bunch of deputies could go in and clean out the camp. like last night. lissen. "citizens, angered at red agitators, burn another squatters' camp, warn agitators to get out of the county."
speaker2: listen. what is these reds? ever'time you turn aroun' somebody sayin' somebody else's a red. what is these reds, anyway?
speaker8: well, i tell you. they was a fella up the country named king--got about 30,000 acres an' a cannery an' a winery--an' he's all a time talkin' about reds. drivin' the country to ruin, he says. got to git rid of 'em, he says. well, they was a young fella jus' come out an' he was listenin one day. he kinda scratched his head an' he says, "mr. king, what is these reds you all a time talkin' about?" well, sir, mr. king says, "young man, a red is any fella that wants thirty cents a hour when i'm payin' twenty-five."
speaker10: i ain't talkin' about that one way or the other. all i'm saying is that there's going to be a fight in the camp saturday night. and there's going to be deputies ready to go in.
speaker2: but why? those fellas ain't botherin' nobody.
speaker10: i'll tell you why. those folks in to being treated like humans. suppose the government closes its camps. suppose too many people pass through 'em. well, when those people go back to the squatters' camps they'll be hard to handle. go on back to work now. maybe i've talked myself into trouble, but you're folks like us, and i like you.

speaker18: we don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
speaker19: well, i don't know what you gonna do about it, because i don't hear no riot an' i don't see no riot, an' what's more i don't believe they is no riot. look for yourself.
speaker19: you got no right to arrest anybody without a warrant, you know.
speaker20: we'll have a warrant--just as soon as we check with headquarters.
speaker6: ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, tommy?
speaker12: i didn't know, ma. i didn't know if i ought.
speaker12: come outside.
speaker12: they was some cops here, ma. they was takin' down the license numbers. it looks like somebody knows sump'n.

speaker12: i'd like to stay. i'd like to be with ya-- --an' see your face when you an' pa get settled in a nice little place. i sure wish i could see you then. but-- --i guess i won't never be able to do that. not now.
speaker6: i could hide you, tommy.
speaker12: i know you would, ma. but i ain't gonna let you. you hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
speaker6: awright, tommy. what you figger you gonna do?
speaker12: you know what i been thinkin' about, ma? about casy. about what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. an' i remember all of it.
speaker6: he was a good man.
speaker12: i been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. an' i been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
speaker6: tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to casy.
speaker12: they gonna drive me anyways. soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. until then...
speaker6: you don't aim to kill nobody, tom!
speaker12: no, ma. not that. that ain't it. but long as i'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe i can do sump'n. maybe i can jus' fin' out sump'n. jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it. but i ain't thought it out clear, ma. i can't. i don't know enough.
speaker6: how'm i gonna know 'bout you? they might kill you an' i wouldn't know. they might hurt you. how'm i gonna know?
speaker12: well, maybe it's like casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
speaker6: then what, tom?
speaker12: then it don't matter. then i'll be all aroun' in the dark. i'll be ever'where--wherever you look. wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, i'll be there. wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, i'll be there. i'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' i'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. an' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, i'll be there too.
speaker6: i don't understan' it, tom.
speaker12: me neither. it's jus' stuff i been thinkin' about. gimme you han', ma. good-by.
speaker6: good-by, tom. later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? you'll try to fin' us?

speaker6: maybe. maybe twenny days work, maybe no days work. we ain't got it till we get it.
speaker13: whatsa matter, ma? gettin' scared?
speaker6: no. ain't ever gonna be scared no more. i was, though. for a while i thought we was beat-- good an' beat. looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't no body frien'ly anymore. it made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
speaker13: watch me pass that chevvy.
speaker22: you the one that keeps us goin', ma. i ain't no good any more, an' i know it. seems like i spen' all my time these days a-thinkin' how it use'ta be--thinkin' of home--an' i ain't never gonna see it no more.
speaker6: woman can change better'n a man. man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. with a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. woman looks at it like that.
speaker13: look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
speaker22: maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
