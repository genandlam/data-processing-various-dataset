speaker1: he's been depressed. all off a sudden, he can't do anything. 
speaker2: why are you depressed, alvy?

speaker1: tell dr. flicker. it's something he read. 
speaker2: something he read, huh?
speaker3: the universe is expanding.
speaker2: the universe is expanding?
speaker3: well, the universe is everything, and if it's expanding, someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything!
speaker1: what is that your business? he stopped doing his homework.
speaker3: what's the point?
speaker1: what has the universe got to do with it? you're here in brooklyn! brooklyn is not expanding!
speaker2: it won't be expanding for billions of years yet, alvy. and we've gotta try to enjoy ourselves while we're here. uh? he laughs.

speaker1: i always felt my schoolmates were idiots. melvyn greenglass, you know, fat little face, and henrietta farrell, just miss perfect all the time. and-and ivan ackerman, always the wrong answer. always. ivan stands up behind his desk. 
speaker2: seven and three is nine.
speaker1: even then i knew they were just jerks. in nineteen forty-two i had already dis-
speaker3: ugh, he kissed me, he kissed me.
speaker4: what'd i do?
speaker5: step up here!
speaker4: what'd i do?
speaker5: you should be ashamed of yourself.
speaker4: why, i was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
speaker5: six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
speaker4: i did.
speaker3: for sakes, alvy, even freud speaks of a latency period.
speaker4: well, i never had a latency period. i can't help it.
speaker4: tell the folks where you are today, donald.
speaker6: i run a profitable dress company.
speaker1: right. sometimes i wonder where my classmates are today.
speaker7: i'm president of the pinkus plumbing company.
speaker8: i sell tallises.

speaker1: i lost track of most of my old schoolmates, but i wound up a comedian. they did not take me in the army. i was, uh ... interestingly enough, i was-i was four-p. 
speaker2: four-p?
speaker1: yes. in-in-in-in the event of war, i'm a hostage.

speaker1: i distinctly heard it. he muttered under his breath, "jew." 
speaker2: you're crazy!
speaker1: no, i'm not. we were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "jew."
speaker2: alvy, you're a total paranoid.
speaker1: wh- how am i a paran-? well, i pick up on those kind o' things. you know, i was having lunch with some guys from nbc, so i said ... uh, "did you eat yet or what?" and tom christie said, "no, didchoo?" not, did you, didchoo eat? jew? no, not did you eat, but jew eat? jew. you get it? jew eat?
speaker2: ah, max, you, uh ...
speaker1: stop calling me max.
speaker2: why, max? it's a good name for you. max, you see conspiracies in everything.
speaker1: no, i don't! you know, i was in a record store. listen to this -so i know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "yes, we have a sale this week on wagner." wagner, max, wagner-so i know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly wagner.
speaker2: right, max. california, max.
speaker1: ah.
speaker2: let's get the outta this crazy city.
speaker1: forget it, max.
speaker2: -we move to sunny l.a. all of show business is out there, max.
speaker1: no, i cannot. you keep bringing it up, but i don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
speaker2: right, max, forget it. aren't you gonna be late for meeting annie?
speaker1: i'm gonna meet her in front of the beekman. i think i have a few minutes left. right?

speaker1: hey, you on television? 
speaker2: no. yeah, once in a while. you know, like occasionally.

speaker2: you wouldn't know it. it doesn't matter. what's the difference?

speaker2: once in a while, you know. i mean, you know, every now-
speaker1: what's your name?
speaker2: i'm ... i'm, uh, i'm robert redford.

speaker2: bad mood? i'm standing with the cast of "the godfather."
speaker4: you're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
speaker2: deal! i'm dealing with two guys named cheech!
speaker4: okay.
speaker4: please, i have a headache, all right?
speaker2: hey, you are in a bad mood. you-you- you must be getting your period.
speaker4: i'm not getting my period. every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that i'm getting my period!
speaker2: a li-little louder. i think one of them may have missed it! h'm, has the picture started yet?
speaker5: it started two minutes ago.
speaker2: that's it! forget it! i-i can't go in.
speaker4: two minutes, alvy.
speaker2: no, i'm sorry, i can't do it. we-we've blown it already. i-you know, uh, i-i can't go in in the middle.
speaker4: in the middle? we'll only miss the titles. they're in swedish.
speaker2: you wanna get coffee for two hours or something? we'll go next-
speaker4: two hours? no, u-uh, i'm going in. i'm going in.
speaker2: go ahead. good-bye.
speaker4: look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
speaker2: hey, can we not stand here and argue in
speaker4: alright. all right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
speaker2: i don't know now. you-you wanna go to another movie? so let's go see the sorrow and the pity.
speaker4: oh, come on, we've seen it. i'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on nazis.
speaker2: well, i'm sorry, i-i can't ... i-i-i've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause-'cause i'm anal.
speaker4: h'h, that's a polite word for what you are.

speaker1: we saw the fellini film last tuesday. it is not one of his best. it lacks a cohesive structure. you know, you get the feeling that he's not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say. 'course, i've always felt he was essentially a-a technical film maker. granted, la strada was a great film. great in its use of negative energy more than anything else. but that simple cohesive core ... 
speaker2: i'm-i'm-i'm gonna have a stroke.
speaker3: well, stop listening to him.
speaker1: you know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. you know what i'm talking about?
speaker2: he's screaming his opinions in my ear.
speaker1: like all that juliet of the spirits or satyricon, i found it incredibly ... indulgent. you know, he really is. he's one of the most indulgent film makers. he really is-
speaker2: key word here is "indulgent."
speaker1: -without getting ... well, let's put it this way ...
speaker2: what are you depressed about?
speaker3: i missed my therapy. i overslept.
speaker2: how can you possibly oversleep?
speaker3: the alarm clock.
speaker2: you know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
speaker3: i know-because of our sexual problem, right?
speaker2: hey, you ... everybody in line at the new yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
speaker1: - it's like samuel beckett, you know- i admire the technique but he doesn't ... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
speaker3: stop it, alvy!
speaker2: well, he's spitting on my neck! you know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
speaker1: and then, the most important thing of all is a comedian's vision.
speaker3: and you know something else? you know, you're so egocentric that if i miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of how it affects you!
speaker1: gal gun-shy is what it is.
speaker2: probably on their first date, right?
speaker1: it's a narrow view.
speaker2: probably met by answering an ad in the new york review of books. "thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in mozart, james joyce and sodomy." whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
speaker3: oh!
speaker2: i-i-i mean, i'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in brooklyn.
speaker3: okay, i'm very sorry. my sexual problem! okay, my sexual problem! huh?
speaker2: i never read that. that was-that was henry james, right? novel, uh, the sequel to turn of the screw? my sexual ...
speaker1: it's the influence of television. yeah, now marshall mcluhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand? a hot medium ... as opposed to a ...
speaker2: what i wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
speaker1: ... as opposed to a print ...
speaker2: what do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind you? i mean, it's just maddening!
speaker1: wait a minute, why can't i give my opinion? it's a free country!
speaker2: i mean, d- he can give you- do you hafta give it so loud? i mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? and-and the funny part of it is, m-marshall mcluhan, you don't know anything about marshall mcluhan's...work!
speaker1: wait a minute! really? really? i happen to teach a class at columbia called "tv media and culture"! so i think that my insights into mr. mcluhan-well, have a great deal of validity.
speaker2: oh, do yuh?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: well, that's funny, because i happen to have mr. mcluhan right here. so ... so, here, just let me-i mean, all right. come over here ... a second.
speaker1: oh.
speaker2: tell him.
speaker4: i hear-i heard what you were saying. you-you know nothing of my work. you mean my whole fallacy is wrong. how you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing.
speaker2: boy, if life were only like this!

speaker1: chronicle of a french town during the occupation 
speaker2: june fourteenth, nineteen forty, the german army occupies paris. all over the country, people are desperate for every available scrap of news.

speaker1: boy, those guys in the french resistance were really brave, you know? got to listen to maurice chevalier sing so much. 
speaker2: m'm, i don't know, sometimes i ask myself how i'd stand up under torture.
speaker1: you? you kiddin'? if the gestapo would take away your bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
speaker2: that movie makes me feel guilty.
speaker1: yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
speaker2: alvy, i ...
speaker1: what-what-what-what's the matter?
speaker2: i-you know, i don't wanna.
speaker1: what-what-i don't ... it's not natural! we're sleeping in a bed together. you know, it's been a long time.
speaker2: i know, well, it's just that-you know, i mean, i-i-i-i gotta sing tomorrow night, so i have to rest my voice.
speaker1: it's always some kind of an excuse. it's- you know, you used to think that i was very sexy. what ... when we first started going out, we had constantly ... we're- we're probably listed in the guinness book of world records.
speaker2: i know. well, alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that i'm going through a phase, that's all.
speaker1: m'm.
speaker2: i mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. you were very hot for allison at first.

speaker1: ma'am, you're on right after this man ... about twenty minutes, something like that. 
speaker2: oh, thank you.
speaker3: excuse ... excuse me, when do i go on?
speaker1: who are you?
speaker3: alvy ... alvy singer. i'm a comedian.
speaker1: oh, comedian. yes. oh, uh ... you're on next.
speaker3: what do you mean, next?
speaker1: uh ... i mean you're on right after this act.
speaker3: no, it can't be, because he's a comic.
speaker1: yes.
speaker3: so what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
speaker1: why not?
speaker3: no, i'm sorry, i'm not goin'- i can't ... i don't wanna go on after that comedian.
speaker1: it's okay.
speaker3: no, because they're-they're laughing, so i-i-i'd rather not. if you don't mind, i prefer-
speaker1: will you relax, please? they're gonna love you, i know.
speaker3: i prefer not to, because ... look, they're laughing at him. see, so what are yuh telling me- they move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings.
speaker1: yes.
speaker3: -that i've got to ... ah ... ah ... they're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then i gotta go out there, i gotta ... get laughs, too. how much can they laugh? they-they they're laughed out.
speaker1: do you feel all right?
speaker4: you know ...
speaker3: look, what's your-what's your name?
speaker4: ... general eisenhower is not ...
speaker1: allison.
speaker3: yeah? allison what?
speaker1: portchnik.
speaker4: ... a group from the ...
speaker3: thank you. i-i don't know why they would have me at this kind of rally 'cause ... excuse me, i'm not essentially a political comedian at all.
speaker3: i ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... a woman in the eisenhower administration ... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause i was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years.

speaker1: h'm, i'm sorry, i can't go through with this, because it-i can't get it off my mind, allison ... it's obsessing me! 
speaker2: well, i'm getting tired of it. i need your attention.
speaker1: it-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense. he drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. so-how is it possible for oswald to have fired from two angles at once? it doesn't make sense.
speaker2: alvy.
speaker1: i'll tell you this! he was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range. but ... if there was a second assassin ... it- that's it!
speaker2: we've been through this.
speaker1: if they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
speaker2: okay. all right, so whatta yuh saying, now? that e-e-everybody o-o-on the warren commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
speaker1: well, why not?
speaker2: yeah, earl warren?
speaker1: hey ... honey, i don't know earl warren.
speaker2: lyndon johnson?
speaker1: l-l-lyndon johns lyndon johnson is a politician. you know the ethics those guys have? it's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
speaker2: then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
speaker1: tsch.
speaker2: the fbi, and the cia, and j. edgar hoover and oil companies and the pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the white house?
speaker1: i-i-i-i would leave out the men's-room attendant.
speaker2: you're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid with me.
speaker1: oh, my she's right! why did i turn off allison portchnik? she was-she was beautiful. she was willing. she was real ... intelligent. is it the old groucho marx joke? that-that i-i just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?

speaker1: alvy, now don't panic. please. 
speaker2: look, i told you it was a ... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
speaker1: stop it! don't ... don't do that! there.

speaker1: well, maybe we should just call the police. dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad. 
speaker2: come on, alvy, they're only baby ones, for sake.
speaker1: if they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
speaker2: oh, all right. all right! it's all right. here.
speaker1: don't give it to me. don't!
speaker2: oooh! here! here!
speaker1: look! look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. it'll turn up in our bed at night. will you get outta here with that thing?
speaker2: get him!
speaker1: talk to him. you speak shellfish! hey, look ... put it in the pot.
speaker2: i can't! i can't put him in the pot. i can't put a live thing in hot water.
speaker2: oh, here yuh go! oh, good, now he'll think- aaaah! okay.
speaker1: okay, it's in. it's definitely in the pot!
speaker2: all right. all right. all right.
speaker1: annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. i can't get it out. this thing's heavy. maybe if i put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what i mean?
speaker2: yeah. i'm gonna get my ... i'm gonna get my camera.
speaker1: you know, i-i think ... if i could pry this door off ... we shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. they don't run around.
speaker2: great! great! goddammit! ooooh! these are ... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. hold it, please!
speaker1: all right! all right! all right! all right! whatta yuh mean? are yuh gonna take pictures now?
speaker2: it'll make great- alvy, be- alvy, it'll be wonderful ... ooooh, lovely!
speaker1: all right, here! oh, it's disgusting!
speaker2: don't be a jerk. one more, alvy, please, one more picture. oh, oh, good, good!

speaker1: so, so-well, here's what i wanna know. w-what ... am i your first big romance? 
speaker2: oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. no.
speaker1: well, then, w-who was?
speaker2: oh, well, let's see, there was dennis, from chippewa falls high school.

speaker1: dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on saturday night. 
speaker2: oh, you should've seen what i looked like then.
speaker1: oh, i can imagine. p-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
speaker2: then there was jerry, the actor.

speaker1: look at you, you-you,-re such a clown. 
speaker2: i look pretty.
speaker1: well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you ...
speaker3: acting is like an exploration of the soul. i-it's very religious. uh, like, uh, a kind of liberating consciousness. it's like a visual poem.
speaker4: is he kidding with that crap?
speaker5: oh, right. right, yeah, i think i know exactly what you mean, when you say "religious."
speaker4: you do?
speaker6: oh, come on-i mean, i was still younger.
speaker4: hey, that was last year.
speaker3: it's like when i think of dying. you know how i would like to die?
speaker5: no, how?
speaker3: i'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.
speaker1: heavy! eaten by some squirrels.
speaker2: hey, listen-i mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat-looking and he was emotional ... y-hey, i don't think you like emotion too much.
speaker3: touch my heart ... with your foot.
speaker1: i-i may throw up!

speaker1: he was creepy. 
speaker2: yeah, i-i think you're pretty lucky i came along.
speaker1: oh, really? well, la-de-da!
speaker2: la-de-da. if i-if anyone had ever told me that i would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la-de-da" . . .
speaker1: oh, that's right. that you really like those new york girls.
speaker2: well, no ... not just, not only.
speaker1: oh, i'd say so. you married-

speaker1: -two of them. 
speaker2: there's henry drucker. he has a chair in history at princeton. oh, the short man is hershel kaminsky. he has a chair in philosophy at cornell.
speaker3: yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
speaker2: why are you so hostile?
speaker3: 'cause i wanna watch the knicks on television.
speaker2: is that paul goodman? no. and be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. hi, doug! douglas wyatt. "a foul-rag-and-bone shop-of-the-heart."
speaker3: i'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for dysentery.
speaker2: commentary.
speaker3: oh, really, i heard that commentary and dissent had merged and formed dysentery.
speaker2: no jokes-these are friends, okay?

speaker1: cleveland cavaliers losing to the new york knicks. 
speaker2: here you are. there's people out there.
speaker3: hey, you wouldn't believe this. two minutes ago, the knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now ... they're ahead two points.
speaker2: alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
speaker2: stop acting out.
speaker3: no, it'll be great! it'll be great, be-because all those ph.d.'s are in there, you know, like ... discussing models of alienation and we'll be in here quietly humping.
speaker2: alvy, don't! you're using to express hostility.
speaker3: "'why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?' he said as he removed her brassiere..."
speaker2: there are people out there from the new yorker magazine. my what would they think?

speaker1: oh, i'm sorry! 
speaker2: don't get upset!
speaker1: i was so close.
speaker2: last night it was some guy honking his car horn. i mean, the city can't close down. you know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? no more flights so we can have sex?
speaker1: i'm too tense. i need a valium. my analyst says i should live in the country and not in new york.
speaker2: well, i can't li- we can't have this discussion all the time. the country makes me nervous. there's ... you got crickets and it-it's quiet ... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the manson family possibly, yuh got and terry-
speaker2: hey, come on, it's quiet now. we can-we can start again.
speaker1: i can't.
speaker2: what-
speaker1: my head is throbbing.

speaker1: i have a headache.
speaker2: bad?
speaker1: oswald and ghosts.
speaker2: 
speaker1: where are you going?
speaker2: well, i'm-i'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.

speaker1: max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers- 
speaker2: right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind new york city is-is anti-semitism.
speaker1: max, the city is terribly worried.
speaker2: but the- i'm not discussing politics or economics. this is foreskin.
speaker1: no, no, no, max, that's a very convenient out. every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-semitism.
speaker2: don't you see? the rest of the country looks upon new york like we're-we're left-wing communist, jewish, homosexual, pornographers. i think of us that way, sometimes, and i-i live here.
speaker1: max, if we lived in california, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
speaker2: sun is bad for yuh. everything our parents said was good is bad. sun, milk, red meat, college ...

speaker1: you know alvy?

speaker2: hi. oh, hi. hi.
speaker1: well, bye. she laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
speaker2: you-you play ... very well.
speaker1: oh, yeah? so do you. oh, whatta- whatta thing to say, right? i mean, you say it, "you play well," and right away ... i have to say well. oh, oh ... annie. well ... oh, well ... la-de-da, la-de-da, la-la.

speaker1: neat?
speaker2: neat, yeah.
speaker1: uh, i hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, i would say, at the turn of the century. who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
speaker2: oh ... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's father-and that's my ... brother, duane.
speaker1: duane?
speaker2: yeah, right, duane-and over there is grammy hall, and that's sadie.
speaker1: well, who's sadie?
speaker2: sadie? oh, well, sadie... sadie met grammy through, uh, through grammy's brother george. uh, george was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. what is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? uh ...
speaker1: uh, narcolepsy.
speaker2: narcolepsy, right, right. right. so, anyway, so ... george, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave george this big turkey at christmas time because he was ... shell-shocked, you know what i mean, in the first world war. anyway, so, so ... george is standing in line, oh, just a sec ...uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. so, so... so, he's dead ... he's dead. yeah. oh, dear. well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? i mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
speaker1: yeah, it's a great story, though, i mean, i... i ... it really made my day. hey, i think i should get outta here, you know, 'cause i think i'm imposing, you know ...
speaker2: oh, really? oh, well ... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh ...
speaker1: ... and ... uh, yeah, uh ... uh, you know, i-i-i...
speaker2: well, i mean, you don't have to, you know.
speaker1: no, i know, but ... but, you know, i'm all perspired and everything.
speaker2: well, didn't you take, uh ... uh, a shower at the club?
speaker1: me? no, no, no, 'cause i never shower in a public place.
speaker2: why not?
speaker1: 'cause i don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh ...
speaker2: oh, i see, i see.
speaker1: you know, i don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
speaker2: yeah. oh, yeah. yeah, i see. i guess-

speaker1: as do alvy's: you are a great-looking girl
speaker2: well, i-i-i would-i would like to take a serious photography course soon.
speaker1: photography's interesting, 'cause, you know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have not emerged yet.
speaker2: aesthetic criteria? you mean, whether it's, uh, good photo or not?
speaker1: the-the medium enters in as a condition of the art form itself. that's-
speaker2: well, well, i ... to me-i ... i mean, it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you know. i mean, i just try to uh, feel it, you know? i try to get a sense of it and not think about it so much.
speaker1: still, still we- you need a set of aesthetic guide lines to put it in social perspective, i think. christ, i sound like fm radio. relax
speaker2: well, i don't know. i mean, i guess-i guess you must be sorta late, huh?

speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: and-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. you know, we never kissed before and i'll never know when to make the right move or anything. so we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. okay?
speaker1: oh, all right.
speaker2: and we'll digest our food better.

speaker2: here, you want some?
speaker1: no, no, i-i-i, uh, i don't use any major hallucinogenics because i took a puff like five years ago at a party and
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: -tried to take my pants off over my head ... ... my ear.
speaker2: oh, i don't know, i don't really. i don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er ... relaxes me at first.
speaker1: m'hm. you're not gonna believe this, but-
speaker2: what? what?

speaker1: hey? 
speaker2: h'm?
speaker1: i-i-i'm gonna buy you these books, i think, because i-i think you should read them. you know, instead of that cat book.
speaker2: that's, uh ... that's pretty serious stuff there.
speaker1: yeah, 'cause i-i'm, you know, i'm, i'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, i think. big-
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: -big subject with me, yeah.
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: i've a very pessimistic view of life. you should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. i-i-i feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
speaker2: m'hm.
speaker1: those are the two categories ...
speaker2: m'hm.
speaker1: ... you know, they're- the-the horrible would be like, uh, i don't know, terminal cases, you know?
speaker2: m'hm.
speaker1: and blind people, crippled ...
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: i don't-don't know how they get through life. it's amazing to me.
speaker2: m'hm.
speaker1: you know, and the miserable is everyone else. that's-that's all. so-so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- you're very lucky ... to be ... ... to be miserable.
speaker2: u-huh.

speaker1: look, look at that guy. 
speaker2: m'hm.
speaker1: there's-there's-there's-there's mr. when-in-the-pink, mr. miami beach, there, you know? he's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. he placed third.
speaker2: m'hm. yeah. yeah.
speaker1: look at these guys.

speaker1: you see, like you and i ... 
speaker2: you are extremely sexy.
speaker1: no, i'm not.
speaker2: unbelievably sexy. yes, you are. because ... you know what you are? you're-you're polymorphously perverse.
speaker1: well, what does-what does that mean? i don't know what that is.
speaker2: uh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when i touch you.
speaker1: ooooh!
speaker2: you know what i mean? like the tip o'your nose, and if i stroke your teeth or your kneecaps ... you get excited.
speaker1: come on. yeah. you know what? you know, i like you, i really mean it. i really do like you.
speaker2: you- do you love me?
speaker1: do i love you?
speaker2: that's the key question.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: i know you've only known me a short while.
speaker1: well, i certainly ... i think that's very- yeah, yeah ... yeah. do you love me?
speaker2: i-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: - i ... i love you. you know i lo-ove you, i-i love you. i-i have to invent- of course i love you.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: don't you think i do?
speaker1: i dunno.

speaker1: whatta you mean? you're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you? 
speaker2: of course.
speaker1: yeah, bu-bu-but why?
speaker2: well, i mean, i'm moving in with you, that's why.
speaker1: yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
speaker2: i have a tiny apartment.
speaker1: yeah, i know it's small.
speaker2: that's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
speaker1: all right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. you know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a ... ... rapidly growing field.
speaker2: you don't want me to live with you?
speaker1: how- i don't want you to live with me? how- whose idea was it?
speaker2: mine.
speaker1: ye-ah. was it ... it was yours actually, but, uh, i approved it immediately.
speaker2: i guess you think that i talked you into something, huh?

speaker1: no-what, what ...? i ... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh? 
speaker2: how is it any different?
speaker1: it's different 'cause you keep your own apartment. because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft ... that we know that we're not married.
speaker2: that little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, alvy.
speaker1: that place is four hundred dollars a month?
speaker2: yes, it is.
speaker1: it's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. i'll-my accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, i'll pay for it.
speaker2: you don't think i'm smart enough to be serious about.
speaker1: hey, don't be ridiculous.
speaker2: then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like i was or something?
speaker1: 'cause adult education's a wonderful thing. you meet a lotta interesting professors. you know, it's stimulating.

speaker1: does this sound like a good course? uh, "modern american poetry"? uh, or, uh-let's see now ... maybe i should, uh, take "introduction to the novel." 
speaker2: just don't take any course where they make you read beowulf.
speaker1: what? hey, listen, what-what do you think? do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in southampton tonight?
speaker2: no, don't be silly. what-what do we need other people for? you know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
speaker1: well, okay. well, listen, i'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
speaker2: yeah, grass, right? the illusion that it will make a white woman more like billie holiday.
speaker1: well, have you ever made love high?
speaker2: me, no. you ... i-i-you know, if i have grass or alcohol or anything i get unbearably wonderful. i get too, too wonderful for words. you know, i don't-i don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
speaker1: it relaxes me.
speaker2: oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
speaker1: well, what's the difference, anyway?
speaker2: well, i'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. you can sleep through it.
speaker1: oh, come on, look who's talking. you've
speaker2: oh, come, you don't need that.
speaker1: what are you doing?
speaker2: no, no, no, what ... you can once, you can live without it once. come on.
speaker1: oh, no, alvy, please. alvy, please. m'mrnm.
speaker2: m'm, wait, i got a great idea. hang in there for a second. i got a little-little artifact. a little artifact, that-that i brought up from the city, which i think, uh, is gonna be perfect. i just ... there ... there's a little old new orleans ... essence. now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. there, now there. m'mmm. m'mmm. hey, is something wrong?
speaker1: uh-uh-why?
speaker2: i don't know. you- it's like you're- you're removed.
speaker1: no, i'm fine.
speaker2: really?
speaker1: u-huh.
speaker2: i don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
speaker1: let's just do it, all right?
speaker2: is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
speaker3: alvy, do you remember where i put my drawing pad? because while you two are doing that, i think i'm gonna do some drawing.
speaker2: you see, that's what i call removed.
speaker1: oh, you have my body.
speaker2: yeah, but that's not-that's no good. i want the whole thing.
speaker1: well, i need grass and so do you.
speaker2: well, it ruins it for me if you have grass because, you know, i'm, like, a comedian-
speaker1: m'hm.
speaker2: -so if i get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. you know-'cause they're always laughin'.
speaker1: were you always funny?
speaker2: hey, what is this-an interview? we're supposed to be making love.

speaker1: this guy is naturally funny. i think he can write for you. 
speaker2: this guy's pathetic.
speaker3: ... big lumberjack ...
speaker2: look at him mincing around, like he thinks he's real cute. you wanna throw up. if only i had the nerve to do my own jokes. i don't know how much longer i can keep this smile frozen on my face. i'm in the wrong business, i know it.
speaker3: "'cherie, come back. i love you. but, uh, cheri, what will i do with this, uh?' he says, 'aw, marie, sometime you make me so mad."' oh, they scream at that. now, write me somethin' like that, will yuh? kinda french number, can yuh do it? huh, kid?

speaker1: alvy, you were ... alvy, you were just great, i'm not kidding. it was- you were so neat. 
speaker2: c-c-coll- college audiences are so wonderful.
speaker1: yeah. yeah. and you know something? i think that i'm starting to get more of your references, too.
speaker2: are yuh?
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
speaker3: may i have your autograph?
speaker1: oh.
speaker2: you're so sure about it.
speaker1: oh, i'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. i mean, you know, i think that it'll be really nice to meet mother and father.
speaker2: yeah, i know, they'll hate me immediately. thank you.
speaker1: no, i don't think so. no, i don't think they're gonna hate you at all. on the contrary, i think-
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: it's easter. you know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. i think they're gonna really like you.

speaker1: it's a nice ham this year, mom. grammy hall takes a sip of her wine and nods.

speaker1: oh, that randolph hunt. you remember randy hunt, annie. he was in the choir with you.
speaker2: oh, yes, yes.
speaker4: i can't believe this family. annie's mother. she really's beautiful. and they're talkin' swap meets and boat basins, and the old lady at the end of the table is a classic jew hater. and, uh, they, they realty look american, you know, very healthy and ... like they never get sick or anything. nothing like my family. you know, the two are like oil and water.
speaker6: let 'im drop dead! who needs his business?!
speaker7: his wife has diabetes!
speaker6: di-diabetes? is that any excuse? diabetes?
speaker8: the man is fifty years old and doesn't have a substantial job.

speaker2: oh, hi, duane, how's it goin'?
speaker1: this is my room.
speaker2: oh, yeah? terrific.
speaker1: can i confess something?
speaker1: i tell you this because, as an artist, i think you'll understand. sometimes when i'm driving ... on the road at night ... i see two headlights coming toward me. fast. i have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. i can anticipate the explosion. the sound of shattering glass. the ... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
speaker2: right. tsch, well, i have to-i have t-o go now, duane, because i-i'm due back on the planet earth.

speaker1: now, don't let it be so long, now. 
speaker2: no.

speaker2: why? 'cause i ... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? that's not following!
speaker1: well, what is your definition of following?
speaker2: following is different. i was spying.
speaker1: do you realize how paranoid you are?
speaker2: paranoid? i'm looking at you. you got your arms around another guy.
speaker1: that is the worst kind of paranoia.
speaker2: yeah-well, i didn't start out spying. i-i thought i'd surprise yuh. pick you up after school.
speaker1: yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? it's your phrase.
speaker2: oh, stop it. but you were having an affair with your college professor. that jerk that teaches that incredible course "contemporary crisis in western man"!
speaker1: "existential motifs in russian literature"! you're really close.
speaker2: what's the difference? it's all mental masturbation.
speaker1: oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
speaker2: hey, don't knock masturbation! it's with someone i love.
speaker1: we're not having an affair. he's married. he just happens to think i'm neat.
speaker2: "neat"! there's that- what are you-twelve years old? that's one o' your chippewa falls expressions! "he thinks i'm neat."
speaker1: who cares? who cares?
speaker2: next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!

speaker2: oh, yeah? how'd it go?
speaker1: oh, it was ... really weird. but she's a very nice woman.
speaker2: yeah?

speaker1: yeah, and he's strangling me ...
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: ... and i keep, you know, it's-
speaker2: well, well, sure ... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. so you're trying to suffocate yourself. it-it makes perfect sense. uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic ... kind of insight.
speaker1: she said, your name was alvy singer.
speaker2: whatta you mean? me?
speaker1: yeah, yeah, yeah, you. because in the dream ... i break sinatra's glasses.
speaker2: sinatra had gl- you never said sinatra had glasses. so whatta you saying that i-i'm suffocating you?
speaker1: oh, and alvy, i did ... this really terrible thing to him. because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
speaker2: tsch, what'd the doctor say?
speaker1: well, she said that i should probably come five times a week. and you know something? i don't think i mind analysis at all. the only question is, will it change my wife?
speaker2: will it change your wife?
speaker1: will it change my life?
speaker2: yeah, but you said, "will it change my wife"!
speaker1: no, i didn't. i said, "will it change my life," alvy.
speaker2: you said, "will it change. . ." wife. will it change ...
speaker1: life. i said, "life." alvy turns toward the camera.
speaker2: she said, "will it change my wife." you heard that because you were there so i'm not crazy.
speaker1: and, alvy ... and then i told her about how i didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that i'm smart enough. she walks out of the room.
speaker2: why do you always bring that up? because i encourage you to take adult-education courses? i think it's a wonderful thing. you meet wonderful, interesting professors'.

speaker1: adult education is such junk! the professors are so phony. how can you do it? 
speaker2: a bit rapidly. i don't care what you say about david, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
speaker1: david! david! i can't believe this!

speaker1: i'm following you and david, if you- 
speaker2: i just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
speaker1: that's fine. that's fine. that's great! well, i don't know what i did wrong. i mean, i can't believe this. somewhere she cooled off to me! is it-is it something that i did?
speaker3: never something you do. that's how people are. love fades.
speaker1: love fades. that's a depressing thought. have to ask you a question. don't go any further. now, with your wife in bed, d-d-does she need some kind o' artificial stimulation like-like marijuana?
speaker4: we use a large vibrating egg.
speaker1: large vibrating egg. well, i ask a psychopath, i get that kind of an answer. i-i, uh, here ... you-you look like a really happy couple. uh, uh ... are you?
speaker5: yeah.
speaker1: yeah! so ... so h-h-how do you account for it?
speaker5: uh, i'm very shallow and empty and i have no ideas and nothing interesting to say.
speaker6: and i'm exactly the same way.
speaker1: i see. well, that's very interesting.
speaker6: right.
speaker5: yeah.
speaker1: oh, well, thanks very much for talking to me.
speaker7: you know, even as a kid i always went for the wrong women. i think that's my problem. when my mother took me to see snow white, everyone fell in love with snow white. i immediately fell for the wicked queen.
speaker8: we never have any fun anymore.
speaker9: how can you say that?
speaker8: why not? you're always leaning on me to improve myself.
speaker9: you're just upset. you must be getting your period.
speaker8: i don't get a period! i'm a cartoon character. can't i be upset once in a while?
speaker10: max, will you forget about annie? i know lots of women you can date.
speaker9: i don't wanna go out with any other women.
speaker10: max, have i got a girl for you. you are going to love her. she's a reporter-
speaker11: -for rolling stone.
speaker12: i think there are more people here to see the maharishi than there were to see the dylan concert. i covered the dylan concert ... which gave me chills. especially when he sang "she takes just like a woman and she makes love just like a woman yes, she does and she aches just like a woman but she breaks just like a little girl." up to that i guess the most charismatic event i covered was mick's birthday when the stones played madison square garden.
speaker1: man, that's great. that's just great.
speaker13: you catch dylan?
speaker1: me? no, no. i-i couldn't make it that ni- my-my raccoon had hepatitis.
speaker13: you have a raccoon?
speaker1: tsch, a few.
speaker13: the only word for this is trans-plendid. it's trans-plendid.
speaker1: i can think of another word.
speaker13: he's i mean, this man is he's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment.
speaker1: really? it must be a tremendous hem.
speaker13: i'm a rosicrucian myself.
speaker1: are you?
speaker13: yeah.
speaker1: i can't get with any religion that advertises in popular mechanics. look- there's coming outta the men's room.
speaker13: it's unbelievably trans-plendid! i was at the stones concert in altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
speaker1: yeah, were yuh? i was-i was at an alice cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.

speaker1: i hope you don't mind that i took so long to finish. 
speaker2: oh, no, no, don't be ... tsch ... don't be silly. you know, i'm startin' it-i'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
speaker1: oh, with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
speaker2: oh, tsch, thank you. h'm.
speaker1: i mean that as a compliment.
speaker2: i think-i think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
speaker1: who said that?
speaker2: uh, oh, i don't know. it might have been leopold and loeb. hello. oh, hi ... uh, no, what-what's the matter? what-what-what? you sound terrible ... no, what- sure i- whatta yuh -what kind of an emergency? ... no, well, stay there. stay there, i'll come over right now. i'll come over right now. just stay there, i'll come right over.

speaker1: what's- it's me, open up. 
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: are you okay? what's the matter? are you all right? what-
speaker2: there's a spider in the bathroom.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: there's a big black spider in the bathroom.
speaker1: that's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
speaker2: my i mean, you know how i am about insects.

speaker1: oooh. 
speaker2: -i can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
speaker1: kill it! for go- what's wrong with you? don't you have a can of raid in the house?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: i told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. you never know who's gonna crawl over.
speaker2: i know, i know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
speaker1: all right, gimme a magazine. i- 'cause i'm a little tired. you know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but i'm prepared for anything. an emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. hey, what is this? what? did you go to a rock concert?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: oh, yeah, really? really? how-how'd you like it? was it-was it, i mean, did it ... was it heavy? did it achieve total heavy-ocity? or was it, uh...
speaker2: it was just great!
speaker1: oh, humdinger. when- well, i got a wonderful idea. why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. you know, it's a- he tosses the book down on the cabinet.
speaker2: i called you; you wanna help me ... or not? h'h? here.
speaker1: what is this? what are you, since when do you read the "national review"? what are you turning in to?
speaker2: well, i like to try to get all points of view.
speaker1: it's wonderful. then why don'tcha get william f. buckley to kill the spider?
speaker2: alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? not only that, you look thin and tired.
speaker1: well, i was in be- it's three o'clock in the morning. you, uh, you got me outta bed, i ran over here, i couldn't get a taxi cab. you said it was an emergency, and i didn't ge- i ran up the stairs. - i was a lot more attractive when the evening began. look, uh, tell- whatta you- are you going with a right-wing rock-and roll star? is that possible?
speaker2: would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
speaker1: hey, what am i-your son? whatta you mean? i-i came over tv --_
speaker2: i got the good chocolate, alvy.
speaker1: yeah, where is the spider?
speaker2: it really is lovely. it's in the bathroom.
speaker1: is he in the bathroom?
speaker2: hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? and flush it a couple o' times.
speaker1: darling, darling, i've been killing spiders since i was thirty, okay?
speaker2: oh. what?
speaker1: very big spider.
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: two ... yeah. lotta, lotta trouble. there's two of 'em.
speaker2: two?
speaker1: yep. i didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. you got a broom or something with a-
speaker2: oh, i-i left it at your house.
speaker1: -snow shovel or anything or something.
speaker2: i think i left it there, i'm sorry.
speaker1: okay, let me have this.
speaker2: well, what are you doing ... what are you doing with-
speaker1: honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a buick.
speaker2: well, okay. oooh.
speaker1: hey, what is this? you got black soap?

speaker1: it's for my complexion. 
speaker2: whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? geez. don't worry! i did it! i killed them both. what-what's the matter? whatta you- -whatta you sad about? you- what'd you want me to do? capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
speaker1: oh, don't go, okay? please.

speaker1: whatta you mean, don't go? whatta-whatta -what's the matter? whatta you expecting -termites? what's the matter? 
speaker1: oh, really?
speaker2: oh, yeah. oh. oh! alvy?
speaker1: what?

speaker1: w-w-whatta you mean?
speaker2: i mean was there another- i thought i heard a voice.
speaker1: oh, i had the radio on.
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: i'm sorry. i had the television set ... i had the television-
speaker2: yeah.

speaker1: alvy, let's never break up again. i don't wanna be apart. 
speaker2: oh, no, no, i think we're both much too mature for something like that.
speaker1: living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
speaker2: it's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know? better than either one of my marriages. see, 'cause. . . 'cause there's just something different about you. i don't know what it is, but it's great.
speaker1: you know i think that if you let me, maybe i could help you have more fun, you know? i mean, i know it's hard and ... yeah.
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: alvy, what about ... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
speaker2: tsch, why don't we get ... why don't we get rob, and the three of us'll drive into brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
speaker1: okay, okay. okay.

speaker1: we can show her the schoolyard.
speaker2: right. i was a great athlete. tell her, max, i was the best, i was all schoolyard.
speaker1: yes, i remember. he was all schoolyard. they threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
speaker2: yeah, well, i used to lose my glasses a lot.

speaker1: oh, look, look, there's that ... that's -that's my old house. that's where i used to live. 
speaker2: holy cow!
speaker3: you're lucky, max-where i used to live is now a pornographic equipment store.
speaker1: i have some very good memories there.
speaker3: what kind of good memories, max? your mother and father fighting all the time.
speaker1: yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.

speaker1: you fired the cleaning woman? 
speaker2: she was stealing.
speaker1: but she's colored.

speaker1: so the colored have enough trouble. 
speaker2: she was going through my pocketbook!
speaker1: they're persecuted enough!
speaker2: who's persecuting? she stole!
speaker1: all right-so we can afford it.
speaker2: how can we afford it? on your pay? what if she steals more?
speaker1: she's a colored woman, from harlem! she has no money! she's got a right to steal from us! after all, who is she gonna steal from if not us?
speaker3: you're both crazy!
speaker4: they can't hear you, max.
speaker2: leo ... i married a fool!
speaker4: hey, max! who's that?
speaker5: it-it-it's the welcome-home party in nineteen forty-five, for my cousin herbie.
speaker3: look, look, there's-there's that one over there, that's joey nichols, he was my- -father's friend. he was always bothering me when i was a kid.
speaker6: joey nichols. see. nichols. see, nichols! yuh see, nickels! you can always remember my name, just think of joey five cents. that's me. joey five cents!
speaker7: what an asshole!
speaker2: i was always the sister with good common sense. but tessie was always the one with personality. when she was younger, they all wanted to marry tessie.
speaker3: do you believe that, max? tessie moskowitz had the personality. she's the life of the ghetto, no doubt.
speaker2: she was once a great beauty.
speaker4: tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
speaker8: i was a great beauty.
speaker4: uh, how did this personality come about?
speaker8: i was very charming.
speaker4: there were many men interested in you?
speaker8: oh, i was quite a lively dancer.
speaker4: that's pretty hard to believe.

speaker1: well, i had a really good day, you know that? it was just a real fine way to spend my birthday. 
speaker2: ah? oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, i hate to tell yuh.

speaker1: no, no, no, not at all.
speaker3: uh, well, i'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance. seated alvy looks the other way, reacting.

speaker1: yeah.
speaker3: and we could just sit and talk ... nothing. uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
speaker2: remember, we had that thing.
speaker1: what thing?
speaker2: don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
speaker1: thing?
speaker2: -yes, we had, uh ...
speaker1: oh, the thing! oh, the thing ... ... yeah ... yeah.
speaker3: oh, well, i-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now ... that's fine, too. w-w-w-we'll do it another time.
speaker1: hey-
speaker3: maybe if you're on the coast, we'll get together and ... and we'll meet there. he shakes hands with annie.
speaker1: oh.
speaker3: it was a wonderful set.
speaker1: oh, gosh.
speaker3: i really enjoyed it. nice to have metcha. good night.
speaker4: bye-bye.
speaker1: nice to see you ... bye. yeah. bye.
speaker2: what's ... you ... well, what's the matter, you w-wanna go to that party?
speaker1: i don't know, i thought it might be kind of fun, you know what i mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
speaker2: i'm just not ... you know, i don't think i could take a mellow eve- 'cause i-i don't respond well to mellow, you know what i mean, i-i have a tendency to ... if i get too mellow, i-i ripen and then rot. you know, and it's-it's not good for my ...
speaker1: all right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?

speaker1: that day in brooklyn was the last day i remember really having a great time. 
speaker2: well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
speaker1: well, i've been moody and dissatisfied.
speaker3: how often do you sleep together?
speaker4: do you have often?
speaker2: hardly ever. maybe three times a week.
speaker1: constantly! i'd say three times a week. like the other night, alvy wanted to have sex.
speaker2: she would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
speaker1: and ... i don't know ... i mean, six months ago i-i woulda done it. i woulda done it, just to please him.
speaker2: i mean ... i tried everything, you know, i-i-i put on soft music and my-my red light bulb, and ...
speaker1: but the thing is-i mean, since our discussions here, i feel i have a right to my own feelings. i think you woulda been happy because ... uh, uh, i really asserted myself.
speaker2: the incredible thing about it is, i'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and i'm getting screwed.
speaker1: i don't know, though, i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so i do feel guilty if i don't go to bed with him. but if i do go to bed with him, it's like i'm going against my own feelings. i don't know i-i can't win.
speaker2: you know ... it's getting expensive ...my analyst ... for her analyst. she- she's making progress and i'm not making any progress. her progress is defeating my progress.
speaker1: sometimes i think-sometimes i think i should just live with a woman.

speaker1: wow, i don't believe it ... you mean to tell me you guys have never snorted coke? 
speaker2: well, i always wanted to try, you know, but, uh, alvy, uh ... he's very down on it.
speaker3: hey, don't put it on me. you kn- wh-what is it, i don't wanna put a wad of white powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal membranes ... they all start talking at once.
speaker2: you never wanna try anything new, alvy.
speaker3: how can you say that? i mean, who said i-i-i-i said that you, i and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
speaker2: that's sick!
speaker3: yeah, i know it's sick, but it's new. you know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
speaker1: just come on, alvy. do your body a favor. try it, come on.
speaker3: oh, yeah?
speaker2: yeah. come on. it'd be fun.
speaker3: oh, i'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
speaker2: alvy, come on, for your own experience. i mean, you wanna write, why not?
speaker4: it's great stuff, alvy. friend of mine just brought it in from california.
speaker2: oh, do you know something-i didn't tell yuh, we're going to california next week.
speaker5: oh, really?
speaker2: yeah ...
speaker3: ... i'm thrilled. as you know, uh ... uh, on my agent's advice i sold out, and i'm gonna do an appearance on tv.
speaker2: no, no, no that's not it at all. alvy's giving an award on television. gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
speaker5: you're kidding?
speaker3: it's so phony, and we have to leave new york during christmas week, which really kills me.
speaker6: alvy, listen, while you're in california, could you possibly score some coke for me?
speaker3: sure, sure, i'll be glad to. i-i'll just put it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that i have in my boot, you know. h-h-how much is this stuff?
speaker6: it's about two thousand dollars an ounce.
speaker2: 
speaker3: really? and what is the kick of it? because i never ...

speaker1: we wish you a merry christmas, we wish you a merry christmas, we wish you a merry christmas, and a -happy new year. 
speaker2: i've never been so relaxed as i have been since i moved out here, max. i want you to see my house. i live right next to hugh hefner's house, max. he lets me use the jacuzzi. and the women, max, they're like the women in magazine, only they can move their arms and legs.
speaker3: you know, i can't get over that this is really beverly hills.
speaker1: we wish you a merry christmas, and a happy new year.
speaker4: yeah, the architecture is really consistent, isn't it? french next to-
speaker1: oh, christmas ... tree, oh, christmas tree, how bright and green our ...
speaker4: -spanish, next to tudor, next to japanese.
speaker3: it's so clean out here.
speaker4: it's that they don't throw their garbage away. they make it into television shows.
speaker2: aw, come on, max, give us a break, will yuh? it's christmas. annie starts snapping pictures of the view.
speaker4: can you believe this is christmas here?
speaker1: oh christmas tree, oh christmas tree ...
speaker3: you know, it was snowing-it was snowing and really gray in new york yesterday.
speaker2: no kidding?
speaker4: right-well, santa claus will have sunstroke.
speaker2: max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
speaker4: there's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
speaker2: while you're out here, max, i want you to see some of my tv show. and we're invited to a big christmas party.
speaker1: remember christ our savior was born on christmas day to save us all ... from satan's power as we were gone astray.

speaker1: oh. 
speaker2: look, now, charlie, give me a big laugh here.
speaker3: a limousine to the track breakdown?
speaker2: a little bigger.
speaker1: do you realize how immoral this all is?
speaker2: max, i've got a hit series.
speaker1: yeah, i know; but you're adding fake laughs.
speaker4: oh, i'm sorry.
speaker3: arnie.
speaker4: yeah.
speaker2: give me a tremendous laugh here, charlie.
speaker1: look, uh ...
speaker2: we do the show live in front of an audience.
speaker1: great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
speaker2: yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
speaker3: you better lie down. you've been in the sun too long.
speaker2: yeah ... uh, now give me a like a medium-size chuckle here ... and then a big hand.
speaker1: is there booing on there?
speaker5: we were just gonna fix you up with my cousin dolores.
speaker1: oh, max, i don't feel well.
speaker2: what's the matter?
speaker1: i don't know, i just got-i got very dizzy... i feel dizzy, max.
speaker2: well, sit down.
speaker1: oh,
speaker2: you all right?
speaker1: i don't know, i mean, i-
speaker2: you wanna lie down?
speaker1: no, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. i just started getting ...
speaker2: how about a ginger ale?
speaker1: oh, max ... no, i maybe i better lie down.

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: why don't you just try to get a little of this down? this is just plain chicken.
speaker3: oh, oh, no, i can't-i can't eat this. i'm nauseous. if you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know i-i have to go out to burbank ... and give out an award on a tv show.
speaker1: well ... h-h huh ... oh, good ... yes, i'll tell him.
speaker2: well, there's nothing wrong with you actually, so far as i can tell. i mean, you have no fever, no ... no symptoms of anything serious. you haven't been eating pork or shellfish.
speaker1: excuse me. i'm sorry, i'm sorry, doctor. uh, alvy-alvy, that was the show. they said everything is fine. they found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
speaker3: i'm nauseous. oh, now i don't get to do the tv show?
speaker1: yeah. listen, doctor, i'm worried.
speaker2: now, mrs. singer, i can't find anything --
speaker3: christ!
speaker1: nothing at all?
speaker2: no, i think i can get a lab man up here.
speaker3: oh, can i have the salt, please?
speaker1: what do you mean? do you think he's-
speaker2: yes, excuse me. perhaps it would be even better if we took him to the hospital for a day or two.
speaker1: uh-huh ... oh, hospital?
speaker2: well, otherwise, there's no real way to tell what's going on.
speaker3: this is not bad, actually.

speaker1: well, you take a meeting with him, i'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with freddy. 
speaker2: i took a meeting with freddy. freddy took a meeting with charlie. you take a meeting with him.
speaker1: all the good meetings are taken.

speaker1: you like this house, max? 
speaker2: m'hm.
speaker1: i even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
speaker2: whee, you shoulda told me it was tony lacey's party.
speaker1: what difference does that make?
speaker2: i think he has a little thing for annie.
speaker1: oh, no, no, that's bullshit, max. he goes with that girl over there.
speaker2: where?
speaker1: the one with the v.p.l.

speaker1: visible line. max, she is gorgeous. 
speaker2: yeah, she's a ten, max, and that's great for you because you're -you're used to twos, aren't you?
speaker1: there are no twos, max.
speaker2: yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through central park with the surgical masks on muttering.
speaker1: m'hm.
speaker2: and ... uh-
speaker1: how do you like this couple, max?
speaker1: and i think they just came back from masters and johnson.
speaker2: yeah, intensive care ward. my god-hey, max, i think she's ... i think she's giving me the eye.
speaker1: if she comes over here, max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
speaker2: i'll handle it. i'll handle it. hi.
speaker3: you're alvy singer, right? didn't we meet at est?
speaker2: est? no, no, i was never to est.
speaker3: then how can you criticize it?
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: oh, he-he didn't say anything.
speaker2: no, no, i came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so i ... he's my-my food taster. have you two met?
speaker1: hi. how do you do.
speaker3: do you taste to see if the food's poisoned?
speaker2: yeah, he's crazy.
speaker2: hey, you guys are wearin' white. it must be in the stars.
speaker1: yeah. right.
speaker2: uri geller must be on the premises someplace.
speaker1: we're gonna operate together.
speaker4: we just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
speaker5: i don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
speaker4: just ... that's all you need. you can come and stay here.
speaker5: oh.
speaker4: there's a whole wing in this house.
speaker5: oh yeah, stay here? u-huh.
speaker4: you can have it to use. why-why are you smiling?
speaker5: i don't know. i don't know.

speaker1: not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings. 
speaker2: m'mm.
speaker3: this is a great house, really. everything. saunas, jacuzzis, three tennis courts. you know who the original owners were? nelson eddy, then legs diamond. then you know who lived here?
speaker4: trigger.
speaker3: charlie chaplin.
speaker4: hey.
speaker3: right before his un-american thing.
speaker4: yeah, this place is great.
speaker5: yeah.
speaker3: uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still new yorkers.
speaker4: yeah, i love it there.
speaker5: yeah.
speaker3: well, i used to live there. i used to live there for years. you know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
speaker5: yeah.
speaker4: i'm into garbage. it's my thing.
speaker5: boy, this is really a nice screening room. it's really a nice room.
speaker3: oh, and there's another thing about new york. see ... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
speaker5: yeah.
speaker3: it could be freezing, it could be raining.
speaker5: yeah.
speaker3: and here, you just-
speaker6: we saw "grand illusion" here last night.
speaker7: oh, yeah?
speaker8: that's a great film if you're high. hey, you.
speaker3: come and see our bedroom. we did a fantastic lighting job. okay?
speaker5: oh, good. okay.
speaker4: i'm cool.
speaker5: it's wonderful. i mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
speaker4: yeah, and gradually you get old and die. you know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
speaker5: don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
speaker4: yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- a pat on the androgynous side. but it's...
speaker9: yeah, yeah. i forgot my mantra.

speaker1: that was fun. i don't think california is bad at all. it's a drag coming home. 
speaker2: lotta beautiful women. it was fun to flirt.
speaker1: i have to face facts. i-i adore alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
speaker2: i'll have the usual trouble with annie in bed tonight. whatta i need this?
speaker1: if only i had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
speaker2: if only i didn't feel guilty asking annie to move out. it'd probably wreck her. but i should be honest.
speaker3: alvy, uh, let's face it. you know something, don't think our relationship is working.
speaker4: tsch, i know. a relationship, i think, is-is like a shark, you know? it has to constantly move forward or it dies. and i think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.

speaker1: whose "catcher in the rye" is this? 
speaker2: well, let's see now ... if it has my name on it, then i guess it's mine.
speaker1: oh, it sure has ... you know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
speaker2: well, uh, alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as i do.
speaker1: there's no-no question in my mind. i think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
speaker2: now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
speaker1: this "denial of death". you remember this?
speaker2: oh-
speaker1: this is the first book that i got you.
speaker2: -god.
speaker1: remember that day?
speaker2: right. geez, i feel like there's a great weight off my back. m'mmm.
speaker1: thanks, honey.
speaker2: oh, no, no, no, no, no. i mean, you know, no, no, no, i mean, i think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
speaker1: there's no-there's no question about that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, uh, i think a more than fair shot, you know?
speaker2: yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
speaker1: yeah, and i-i tru- you know, i trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
speaker2: well, why should i put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
speaker1: right. and you-and you know what the beauty part is?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: we can always come back together again. because there's no-there's no problem. 'cause ... right.
speaker2: exactly, but ... exactly. ooooh!
speaker1: you know, i-i-i don't think many couples could handle this. you know, they could just break up and remain friends.
speaker2: hey, this one's mine, this button.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: i guess these are all yours. impeach, uh, eisenhower ... impeach nixon ... impeach lyndon johnson ... impeach ronald reagan.

speaker1: i miss annie. i made a terrible mistake. 
speaker2: she's living in los angeles with tony lacey.
speaker1: oh, yeah? well, if she is, then the with her! if she likes that lifestyle, let her live there! he's a jerk, for one thing.
speaker2: he graduated harvard.
speaker1: yeah. he may- listen, harvard makes mistakes too, you know. kissinger taught there.
speaker3: don't tell me you're jealous?
speaker1: yeah, jealous. a little bit like medea. lemme, lemme-can i show you something, lady? what i have here ... i found this in the apartment. black soap. she used to wash her face eight hundred times a day with black soap. don't ask me why.
speaker3: well, why don't you go out with other women?
speaker1: well, i-i tried, but it's, uh, you know, it's very depressing.

speaker1: this always happens to me. quick, g-go get a broom. 
speaker2: what are you making such a big deal about? they're only lobsters. look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
speaker1: i'm not myself since i stopped smoking.
speaker2: oh, when'd you quit smoking?
speaker1: sixteen years ago.
speaker2: whatta you mean?
speaker1: mean?
speaker2: you stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? oh, i-i don't understand. are you joking, or what?

speaker1: whatta you mean, where am i? where do- where do you think i am? i'm-i'm out ... i'm at the los angeles airport. i flew in ... tsch, i-well, i flew in to see you ... hey, listen, can we not debate this on-on the telephone because i'm, you know, i-i feel that i got a temperature and i'm-i'm getting my-my chronic los angeles nausea. i-i don't feel so good. 
speaker2: well, where-wherever you wanna meet, i don't care. i'll-i'll drive in. i rented a car i'm driving ... that ... whatta you mean? what-why is that such a miracle? i'm driving myself --

speaker1: hi. 
speaker2: you look very pretty.
speaker1: oh, no, i just lost a little weight, that's all. well, you look nice.
speaker2: you see, i-i've been thinking about it and i think that we should get married.
speaker1: oh, alvy, come on.
speaker2: why? you wanna live out here all year? it's like living in munchkin land.
speaker1: well, whatta you mean? i mean, it's perfectly fine out here. i mean, tony's very nice and, uh, well, i meet people and i go to parties and-and we play tennis. i mean, that's ... that's a very big step for me, you know? i mean ... i'm able to enjoy people more.
speaker2: so whatta you ... you're not gonna come back to new york?
speaker1: what's so great about new york? i mean, it's a dying city. you read "death in venice."
speaker2: hey, you didn't read "death in venice" till i bought it for yuh.
speaker1: that's right, that's right. you only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
speaker2: that's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
speaker1: alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? i mean, your life is new york city. you're just this person. you're like this island unto yourself.
speaker2: i can't enjoy anything unless i ... unless everybody is. i-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's ... you know, i-i ... it puts a crimp in my evening. so wanna get married or what?
speaker1: no. we're friends. i wanna remain friends.
speaker2: okay. check, please. can i -can i ... can i ... can i ...
speaker1: you're mad, aren't you?
speaker2: no. yes, of course i'm mad, because you love me, i know that.
speaker1: alvy, i can't say that that's true at this point in my life. i really just can't say that that's true. i mean, you know how wonderful you are. i mean, you know ... you're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. anyway, look, i don't wanna- listen, listen, listen, uh h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
speaker2: the usual, you know. uh, tryin't'write. i'm workin' on a play. so whatta yuh saying? that you're not comin' back to new york with me?
speaker1: no! look, i gotta go.
speaker2: you mean that ... i-i-i-i flew three thousand miles to see you.
speaker1: i'm late.
speaker2: air miles, you know. i mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
speaker1: if you must know, it's a hectic time for tony. the grammys are tonight.
speaker2: the what?
speaker1: the grammys. he's got a lotta records up for awards.
speaker2: you mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
speaker1: oh!
speaker2: i thought just earplugs.
speaker1: just forget it, alvy, okay? let's just forget the conversation.
speaker2: officer, i know what you're gonna say. i'm-i'm not a great driver, you know, i-i have some problems with-with-with-
speaker3: may i see your license, please?
speaker2: sure. just don't-don't get angry, you know what i mean? 'cause i-i have - i have my-my license here. you know, it's a rented car. and i've ...
speaker3: don't give me your life story -just pick up the license.
speaker2: pick up the license. you have to ask nicely 'cause i've had an extremely rough day. you know, my girl friend-
speaker3: just give me the license, please.
speaker2: since you put it that way. it's hard for me to refuse. ... have a, i have a terrific problem with authority, you know. i'm... it's not your fault. don't take it personal.

speaker1: imagine my surprise when i got your call, max. 
speaker2: yeah. i had the feeling that i got you at a bad moment. you know, i heard high-pitched squealing.
speaker1: twins, max. sixteen-year-olds. can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
speaker2: you're an actor, max. you should be doing shakespeare in the park.
speaker1: oh, i did shakespeare in the park, max. i got mugged. i was playing richard the second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard. he puts on an elaborate helmet and goggles.
speaker2: max, are we driving through plutonium?
speaker1: keeps out the alpha rays, max. you don't get old.

speaker1: you're a thinking person. how can you choose this lifestyle? 
speaker2: what is so incredibly great about new york? it's a dying city! you-you read "death in venice".
speaker1: you didn't read "death in venice" till i gave it to you!
speaker2: well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
speaker1: it's an important issue.
speaker2: alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
speaker2: you're like new york. you're an island.
speaker1: okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, i guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! you know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here ... in a health -food restaurant on sunset boulevard. goodbye, sunny.
speaker2: wait! i'm-i'm gonna ... go with you. i love you.
speaker3: tsch, whatta you want? it was my first play. you know, you know how you're always tryin' t' get things to come out perfect in art because, uh, it's real difficult in life. interestingly, however, i did run into annie again. it was on the upper west side of manhattan.
