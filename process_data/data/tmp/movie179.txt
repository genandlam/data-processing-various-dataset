speaker1: that's against protocol... 
speaker2: this man is highly dangerous. he has killed and will kill again. he must be taken down on sight. the time it takes you to follow your protocols is the time it takes him to end your life.
speaker2: shall we?

speaker1: uh, are we gonna do it? 
speaker2: well, i don't know, baby. depends on how well you do those nails. now pay attention. you might need to redo that one.
speaker2: shut the up in there! milton twist and pounds the wall right back.

speaker1: you shut the up! that's it! 
speaker2: oh! sorry, i didn't mean... she stops. stares.

speaker1: imbecile. 
speaker2: piper spins, grips the hockey stick.

speaker1: man with sickle enter! 
speaker2: sickle smiles, raises the bladed weapon and--

speaker2: christ. you're the best i've ever had.
speaker2: hello? do you mind?! we're...

speaker1: aw, hell. 
speaker2: i definitely got their attention.

speaker1: what. the you know these people? 
speaker2: come on. there are probably more.

speaker1: shhhh. don't cry little precious. ff-ffump! two doors shut. jonah king turns, freezes. 
speaker2: troopers. remember why we're here.
speaker3: milton, i'm serious! i want some answers!

speaker1: yeah, we both want some answers. milton moves toward the barn as-- the state troopers walk around the bar. everyone freezes. 
speaker1: aw
speaker1: come on!

speaker1: what are you doing?! 
speaker2: have to stop him...
speaker1: milton! those cops weren't trying to arrest us!
speaker2: no. they weren't. get in.
speaker1: i'll drive.
speaker2: you gotta patch me up. i'll drive.
speaker1: they were trying to kill us!
speaker2: yes.

speaker1: they were trying to kill you. 
speaker2: yes.

speaker1: christ. piper's attention is still on the dead cops. 
speaker2: christ is right! they start shooting with no warning?! what are you, a murderer? you escape from prison or something?

speaker1: well?! which is it?! 
speaker2: both.
speaker1: what have you gotten me into? i should...i should...jesus, i just killed a cop! i'm going to prison. give me one good reason i shouldn't shoot you in the face.
speaker2: because i'm driving.
speaker1: you know what i mean!

speaker1: the little girl on the news? the baby girl they're looking for? 
speaker1: but the news said the baby's parents were... piper stops.
speaker2: sons of killed my daughter.
speaker2: so yeah. i busted out. and i'm gonna get my grand-baby back. i'm gonna get her back and i'm gonna kill every last one of the
speaker2: you want out, i'll understand.

speaker1: in the back seat. now. 
speaker2: what? why?
speaker1: now!
speaker1: shotgun. it's already loaded.
speaker1: have the other one ready. not the 357. the old one.

speaker1: it's over, milton. stop the car. 
speaker2: i can't do that.
speaker1: really? what makes you think you have a choice?
speaker2: i got something i gotta do first.
speaker1: then you should have done it a long time ago.
speaker2: i didn't have to do it a long time ago!
speaker1: milton, i will kill that nice woman in the backseat to get to you.
speaker2: i won't let you do that.
speaker1: again. what makes you think you have a choice?
speaker2: now.
speaker2: this does.

speaker1: the back door opens. piper leaps out. 
speaker2: piper! wait!
speaker3: piper approaches the destroyed guard rail.

speaker1: he's not one of the ones who took your granddaughter, is he? 
speaker2: milton stands behind her. shakes his head.
speaker3: someone else.
speaker1: is there anyone not trying to kill you?
speaker1: come on. i'll help you. but we're dealing with that first?

speaker1: my daughter got mixed up with the son of a right out of college. 
speaker2: she knew him? she knew jonah king, the man they think killed...
speaker1: she knew him. the world was in a tailspin and king was preaching quiet revolution.
speaker1: it was four months before she realized ã¢â€â˜quiet' meant hiding in the basement, cutting the heads off chickens.
speaker2: jonah king was into voodoo?
speaker1: voodoo, the occult, not much he wasn't into. when she told him she was leaving, he helped her pack. gassed up her car. cooked her a hot meal. then while she slept he broke her leg in three places with a tire iron.
speaker2: 

speaker1: she learned her lessen. was a good little follower for eighteen months. that's when they met with some witch doctor artist in chinatown. it was chinese new year so the place was wall to wall slants. she saw her chance, stabbed jonah in the face with a souvenir corkscrew and vanished into the crowd. 
speaker2: milton. your daughter was in a cult for two years and you didn't know? why didn't you help her?
speaker1: i didn't find out about any of this until...until i got locked up.
speaker2: not gonna reload?
speaker1: only had three bullets to begin...
speaker2: milton.

speaker1: that's his truck. 
speaker2: stay put. i won't be long.

speaker1: i think he's gonna be okay. 
speaker2: is that right?
speaker3: the cab is empty.
speaker4: realization. but it's too late.
speaker1: i wouldn't.

speaker1: milton! 
speaker1: hey! let me go, fucker!
speaker2: don't piper! let her go. she's a pain in the you don't want.
speaker3: drop it. or we'll gut her.
speaker4: milton, isn't it? why are you here?
speaker2: isn't that obvious, you sick i'm here for her.
speaker4: what's obvious is that you clearly abandoned your daughter.

speaker1: jonah king crushed her so completely that she told everyone you were dead. no, milton, i cannot in good faith hand over this child to you. 
speaker2: but sacrificing her under the full moon, that's okay?
speaker3: okay? milton, your granddaughter is unbelievably blessed. look around. the world's on fire. companies own our governments and the people suffer. daily. and will continue to suffer until change comes. and change will come. thanks to your granddaughter, milton. she will open the door to a new world order.
speaker2: your bs don't work on me. you killed my daughter but i won't let you kill my grandbaby.
speaker3: your daughter's death was an accident.
speaker2: no shithead, it wasn't. i saw the whole thing. i saw who you are when no one's lookin'. and i saw what that night cost ya.
speaker3: milton, you're embarrassing your--
speaker2: --what was it three or four days before he showed after killin my little girl? you jerkoffs didn't notice he was walking a little stiff?
speaker2: when's the last time he shared a bed with either of you? before that night, right?
speaker4: the girls shoot a nervous glance at jonah.
speaker2: you forced my daughter onto her knees, you and she made you pay for it.
speaker2: but don't take my word for it. ask him. leather jacket was there. jonah made him swear not to tell.
speaker3: put the blonde in the rv.
speaker2: i'm only gonna make this offer once. give me my granddaughter and i'll let you liv--

speaker1: please. try something. 
speaker2: jonah climbs into the rv, closes the door.
speaker3: let's go.
speaker4: you killed him! you you --

speaker1: think anyone's in there? 
speaker2: i guess. doors is still closed.
speaker1: bet it's sick. wanna look?

speaker1:  
speaker2: carpenter and despite what you've heard, prefers short hair.
speaker3: you...you nearly killed me!
speaker2: not even close. i won't see you again until...
speaker2: ...until you're seventy-three.
speaker2: you, i'll see in three months.

speaker1: who's still coming? 
speaker2: the old man. he's alive.
speaker3: what?
speaker4: stay down! that's impossible!
speaker1: you shot him in the face! he can't--
speaker2: don't you see? we stand at the crossroads! did you think we would just idly change the world? the forces of evil challenge us! this is wonderful! we show ourselves to be worthy. i'm so very proud of each one of you. tattoo and business woman beam.

speaker1: the rv pulls off the road to the left. 
speaker2: 

speaker1: oops. 
speaker2: i am patient and forgiving, but that was wrong of you.
speaker2: i'm going to kill you now. and then i'm going to your corpse. so that in the afterlife you might consider your sin this day.
speaker1: great. between now and then. i'm'a you up.

speaker1: goodbye, child. 
speaker2: hey,

speaker1: milton. how? 
speaker2: it's still in there. the bullet. i can feel it.
speaker1: but how...how are you still alive?
speaker2: ain't got time to die.

speaker1: i tried, milton. i tried to get her back. 
speaker2: i know, baby. i know. jonah only had about twenty followers. we hurt him good today.
speaker1: devil worshipers freak me out. they mess with powers that should be left alone. turns my white.
speaker2: powers. it's all
speaker1: no, milton. it's real. ghosts, ufos, bigfoot, that's the the devil and demons? once those doors are opened you're milton rolls his one good eye.
speaker1: what do we do now?
speaker2: i used to know a guy lived out this way. you got one of them portable phones?
speaker1: portable phones? you mean a cell phone? yeah, in my bag.

speaker1: scorcher today, huh? 
speaker2: help me...
speaker1: christ on a cracker. my apologies.
speaker1: what's that supposed to mean?
speaker2: it's a symbol of our pact with lord satan.
speaker1: pact huh? that's cute. funny he's never mentioned you.

speaker1: yeah, those are here, have some water. 
speaker1: milton's work i take it?
speaker2: ran me over with his...how do you...? who are you?
speaker1: i'm the accountant. i'm curious. and i never get curious. what do you people want with milton?
speaker2: you're the who?
speaker1: does it matter? milton. why is he important to you?
speaker2: he isn't! he's the one chasing us!
speaker1: why?
speaker2: because! because of what we did.
speaker1: color me curious. what did you do and who did you take?

speaker1: lemme know if i hurt you. 
speaker2: do what you gotta do. you get used to the pain.
speaker1: there. that's better.

speaker1: why does everyone keep saying that? 
speaker2: because he is dead. sure as supposed to be anyway.
speaker2: i carried your coffin, old man. i was there the day we put your in the ground.
speaker3: webster, you gonna yank that .44 or just keep stroking it?
speaker2: that depends. how's this possible?
speaker3: you heard about my daughter?
speaker2: i did.
speaker3: then you know why i'm back.
speaker1: back? back from where? what. the are you two talking about?!
speaker2: it true they took the little one? milton nods.
speaker2: put her in neutral. i'll pull the truck around.

speaker1: sarge! sarge look at this! 
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: cigarette
speaker2: i see that.
speaker1: sarge! it's less than twenty feet from the victims!
speaker2: and less than three feet from the ash bin.
speaker2: pay attention, rookie.
speaker1: hey!

speaker1: you! you can't be here! 
speaker2: rookie!
speaker1: sarge, this joker can't just stomp around the crime scene.
speaker2: captain. sorry about that.
speaker3: one of yours?
speaker2: yessir, i won't let it happen again.
speaker3: get him out of here.
speaker2: cap, he's green, that's all.
speaker3: he's standing on evidence.

speaker1: get me a blanket. and get a medic in here. 
speaker1: you're gonna be okay now. i won't let anything happen to you.
speaker2: he...he killed them. he killed all of them.
speaker1: who did?
speaker2: no. you don't understand, we was fuckin'. he killed them while we was fuckin'. that's never happened to me before, has it happened to you?
speaker1: let's get a shrink in here too.

speaker1: i don't...how is this possible? 
speaker2: he loved his daughter.
speaker1: lots of daddy's love their daughters, doesn't explain shattering reality.
speaker2: that one loved his little girl enough to make her hate him. like timmy yellin' at lassie to go home?
speaker2: you never watched...forget it. milton was a bad husband but he was a good father. used to say it was the only thing he was ever good at. then we went and got mixed up with the wrong crowd. power and money and once you're in there ain't no gettin' out. so to keep her safe he vanished the year before she went off to college.
speaker1: obviously you got out.
speaker2: the we were workin' for, they were gonna kill us when the job was done.

speaker1: so the day before, milton paid'em a little visit. he went alone you see. i didn't know. i would'a gone with him but i didn't know. 
speaker1: being a daddy wasn't the only thing milton was good at. sumbitch was good at being a friend.

speaker1: that fire makin you homesick? 
speaker1: cold beer?
speaker2: you know the pain and suffering ain't the worse part, right? that's what they tell ya, what they want you to believe. but it's all a big lie. nosir, worst part's the video feed.
speaker2: it ain't about the fire and brimstone. ain't about your suffering. it's about the suffering of them you love. cuz you see it. you see it all. in full detail. and there ain't nothin you can do about it.
speaker2: son-in-law. he looked like one of them tree-huggin piece of shits. wore sandals. what kind of man wears sandals?

speaker1: he loved that daughter of mine. loved that little baby too. he kept fightin long after he should'a been dead. but some people's better at killin than others. just how they're wired. 
speaker1: then them sons of turned on my...nosir, physical pain is nothin compared to watching your baby girl...watchin those fuckers...i'm gonna kill'em. i'm gonna kill'em all. and...and then i'll be done. milton finally goes silent.
speaker2: milton, i can't fix that car. but i can get you were you need to be.

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: are you doing?!
speaker2: think you were gonna sneak off by yourself?! go it alone?!
speaker1: uh, no. i need your help. if you're still willing.
speaker2: oh.
speaker2: well if i'd known that i would have slept in a bed!

speaker1: mapquest says it's an eight hour drive and we got twelve until midnight so we should be fine. and get this, ã¢â€âœthe mother of all thingsã¢â€â? ã¢â€âœbleeds black tears unto those who cut herã¢â€â? take a guess what's really bleeding like a stuck pig from the marsh? 
speaker2: black tears of oil?
speaker1: right.
speaker2: webster, i need you to stay here.
speaker1: wha? no. you went alone last time.
speaker2: i'm not going alone this time.
speaker1: you take that little girl over me?
speaker2: give me the shells. and the gun.
speaker2: let's go.

speaker1: he's not coming?

speaker1: who the is this timmy and lassie you two keep talking about?!
speaker2: this ain't gonna be easy, piper. i need you. that's no lie. but are you sure about this?

speaker2: i ain't your daddy.
speaker1: you if you are.

speaker1: what do we do? 
speaker2: nothing yet. not until...
speaker1: oh they know.
speaker2: we can't stop.
speaker1: milton, this will never work.
speaker2: it'll work.
speaker1: no. it won't. nobody gets away anymore. in fifteen minutes there will be choppers, we'll be all over the news...

speaker1: just keep driving him to us. we'll do the rest. and make sure you peel off before the fireworks. 
speaker1: gentlemen, these two killed two of our own. i know you'd like them to pay. therefore, when i tell you to aim for the tires, what i mean is aim for their heads. are we clear?
speaker1: very good. please aim for the tires.

speaker1: just don't stop. 
speaker2: too many of them.
speaker1: just keep driving.
speaker2: i'm...i'm sorry i got you into--
speaker1: --they took your granddaughter, milton, and now these badge-wearing are trying to stop you. you crawled out of the abyss...and a few fat-assed county mounties are giving you pause? your grand-baby needs you.
speaker1: you know what happens to her if they stop us.

speaker1: you lose the last connection you will ever have to this world. you gotta drive. 
speaker1: no. you don't just drive. drive angry! drive with the rage that'll take us through that roadblock!
speaker2: he ain't stopping.
speaker3: good. makes our job easier.

speaker1: well...this is unexpected. 
speaker2: uh...what is that?
speaker3: get down!

speaker1: there's nowhere to go! 
speaker2: shotgun!

speaker1: he's holding an fbi badge in the air. 
speaker2: no way. no ever-loving way in good heaven are you a...
speaker3: need you boys to stand down. captain, you know what this badge means, right?
speaker3: federal bureau of get the outta my way. you boys have blundered into an on-going federal case. now, lower your... he stops, turns...sniffs the air.
speaker3: you.

speaker1: hey, hey!!! cap! 
speaker2: it seems you're serving two masters.
speaker2: take out your phone and call him. call jonah king. tell him the old man is dead.
speaker3: go ahead, trooper. do as the agent says. rest of you. stand down. now!

speaker1: i don't think...why aren't they following us? 
speaker2: they're likely scared of you.
speaker1: now what?
speaker2: now we drive.
speaker3: we pull back...

speaker1: get away from her. 
speaker2: i think not.
speaker1: i shoot you with this, you know what it means. no heaven. no hell. you cease to exist.
speaker2: all the more reason to keep ms. piper in close proximity. you are old, milton. you might miss again.
speaker1: you can't stop me.

speaker1: stop you? milton, you wouldn't be here without me, you ungrateful that roadblock back there, that would have stopped you. so i want you to drop that iron god- killer and say thank you. milton stares. 
speaker1: i said, drop it and thank you.
speaker2: don't hurt her. th-thank you.
speaker1: that's better.
speaker1: you're not the first to get out and i doubt you'll be the last but i gotta know, how did you get out with the god-killer?
speaker2: i just walked in and took it.
speaker1: you did not.
speaker2: i'm an old washed up lifer. never occurred to'em that i was up to no good.
speaker1: wouldn't wanna be you when he finds out.
speaker2: what's he gonna do? not let me back in? now, i gotta know. why?

speaker1: i know why. it's because of those crazy out there isn't it? they figured something out didn't they? somehow they know how to summon a piece of to earth. 
speaker2: that's cute. you haven't told her?
speaker3: she don't listen.
speaker2: young ms. piper, let you in on a little secret. the dark lord? satan? beelzebub? lucifer? simply the warden of a very large prison. quiet man, actually. thoughtful. well read. i happen to know the idea of sacrificing children in his honor annoys him greatly.
speaker3: then why? why help me?
speaker2: simple. like the warden, we all have jobs to do. getting you here makes my job easier. you get what you want, i get what i want.
speaker3: then help me, now. there are forty of them down there. you and i could--
speaker2: --no.

speaker1: you like butter on your popcorn? it's sure to be a grand show. piper doesn't know what to say. 
speaker1: you're still here? milton, the clock is ticking. midnight approaches.
speaker2: then get off my car.

speaker1: it's almost time. 
speaker1: my brothers and sisters, we have come so far. to this place where the dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet. from its death, it shall be reborn. as we will be. we who have survived the slings. the arrows. the revulsion of those too weak to believe. we have been cast out. and hunted. but no more.

speaker1: you want to help him. 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: he chose you, you know that. fast car, spunky attitude. he put your life at risk and you still want to help him?

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: then go.
speaker3: the ancient revolver.
speaker2: hold on tight. it has quite a kick.
speaker1: if i kill you, you can't take him.
speaker2: someone else will come...someone else always comes.
speaker2: piper, he didn't steal that gun to kill me. he stole it to slow me down. he's getting what he wanted. now, go to him. before it's too late.

speaker1: you lose. 
speaker1: get over here!
speaker1: i said get over here! i want him to watch me kill the kid!
speaker1: stupid fine. then just know i promise to kill her slowly.

speaker1: milton?! 
speaker2: she hands him the baby.
speaker3: i'm curious. would you have let him do it?
speaker3: that's what i thought.
speaker3: see you. soon.

speaker1: milton...no... 
speaker2: where...where is she?
speaker3: she's here.
speaker2: keep her safe.
speaker1: i will. anyone tries to hurt her and i'll kill'em.
speaker2: i know. that's why i chose you.
speaker4: they all turn toward the high cliff.

speaker1: webster climbs from the 69 camaro. 
speaker2: webster will look after you both. as long as he can. and he'll keep trying long after he can't.
speaker3: milton. this can't...you can't just give up. there's gotta be something we can do to...
speaker2: beat the devil? nah. never gonna happen. i'm askin more than i have a right to. i know it. but love her for me, piper. love her and make her yours. i don't have any right to ask for your promise...
speaker3: i promise. milton. i promise.
speaker2: thank you.

speaker1: how was that? 
speaker2: the accountant stands over him.
speaker3: i've seen better. guess she doesn't know you can beat him, slow him, shoot him, even stop him...
speaker1: ...but you can't kill a dead man.
