speaker2: absolutely. we don't have to get in each other's way.
speaker1: and that's the way you like it, don't you? you don't like me to bother you.
speaker2: i didn't say that. what i meant is that it's important for us to have our space.
speaker1: well there's not much space here. so i guess you won't be able to get away from me will ya?
speaker2: you know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. an adult conversation. because every time we do, you turn something that i say around and make it mean something that i didn't mean to say.
speaker1: if you're not interested in hearing what i think i just won't say anything.
speaker2: good luck. i just want you to think about what you say sometimes instead of saying what you think all the time.

speaker1: ok. i'm going to say something. and what i'm about to say i've thought long and hard about. i'm the luckiest person alive because i'm living my dream - you, her, this, us, all of it.

speaker1: are my hands cold? 
speaker2: yes.
