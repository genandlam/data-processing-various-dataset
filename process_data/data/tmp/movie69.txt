speaker1: no... stay here... stay! 
speaker1: no... go back... go away...
speaker1: leave me alone! stay here... stay!

speaker1: up the hill! 
speaker2: no, down onto the other beach. the little ones can't take the hill. neither can i.
speaker1: up the hill! they're down there already. i saw them!
speaker2: you're wrong!

speaker1: i'm hungry. 
speaker2: don't move from here. i'll come for you in the morning. there's no food. try and sleep in the branches. don't cry. don't make a noise.

speaker1: it's too cold to spend all night up there. we've got a fire at the beach. food, too. 
speaker1: come on! your mother's down there. she's happy... she's warm, too... and full... she wants to see you... she sent me...

speaker1: i told you! i knew they did it around here! ask him... 
speaker2: what do we do? do we throw you over, is that the idea?
speaker2: he wants me to throw you over. what does it do? does it help the sun? should i throw you over?
speaker1: i tell you, it's one man, one stone. it'll help the voyage.
speaker2: what's it got to do with the sun?
speaker1: i don't know, yet.

speaker1: no. it's too much of a risk. just add a stone to the pile. let him go. that's the best we can do. let's go. 
speaker2: it's meaningless, without him going over the cliff.
speaker1: off you go. we don't want you.

speaker1: bad omens, hector. bad omens. get me something to eat. just a mouse or two. 
speaker2: yes.
speaker2: two mice... and some bread...
speaker3: no mice.
speaker2: two chicken legs, then, cold, and the bread.
speaker4: of course you're free to call at my house at anytime, but i was receiving nepos... how could i admit you?
speaker5: spoiled his day, meeting your man...
speaker6: his ships have gone too, we heard.

speaker1: when did you hear? 
speaker2: last night. nepos knew. pirates. they're sunk, he reckons. that could finish him, eh?
speaker1: this is the worst it's been.
speaker3: you'll be up for sale before you know it!
speaker1: he's finished... you reckon?
speaker3: yes... at the baths... i could tell... they smelled blood...
speaker1: well... if he'd pulled it off he'd be in rome by now...
speaker3: and you with him...
speaker1: and me with him... half way home...

speaker1: he's a true friend, probably the only one i have left. 
speaker2: will he lend you the money?
speaker1: he was honest about it. he said so, plain and simple. no.
speaker2: that's a problem.
speaker1: and the ships have gone... did i tell you that?
speaker2: have they?
speaker1: cyprian knows already. he'll want his money back too...
speaker1: when we get home i want you to get some chickens... and fetch hermas, the diviner.
speaker2: yes.

speaker1: are my ships from sicily still afloat...? 
speaker2: no, no... offer the grain first... sprinkle it on the altar...
speaker2: ... and we can't ask the gods specific questions like that... it's a gentle, probing enquiry... general questions... but let's see.
speaker2: general answer... no...

speaker1: what do you mean? 
speaker2: i mean, no. the liver says no...
speaker1: do it again... i want you to do it again... is it the gods' will... that cyprian... be well disposed towards me... in the future?
speaker2: if you want to do it again, you need another chicken and another fifteen sesterces... and i'd like the first fifteen now please.

speaker1: cyprian loaned me half a million to fit out these ships... i'm finished. just when things were going well... i had plans for you too, hector... in four or five years i was going to make you a free man... and then in ten years you'd be a citizen... you... you could've found your family... brought them here... everything... 
speaker2: it sounds good.
speaker1: it does, doesn't it!
speaker1: i shouldn't give up. i can't... i'll visit cyprian, first thing tomorrow... before the others can get to him... he's got to see reason... i can pay him back... sometime. it's the only chance we have, hector. should i do it?
speaker2: you must.
speaker1: you're right. i must.

speaker1: thalia, i think i need one of your massages. hector, you can finish the lamps. 
speaker1: lower, thalia.

speaker1: i missed you last night. 
speaker2: he kept me working until morning.
speaker3: what's happening?

speaker1: he has no money and a lot of enemies. if he's very clever he'll survive... but the omens are bad... 
speaker2: she doesn't like him.
speaker1: nobody does. he's unfortunate. you get people like that. clumsy and sad.
speaker2: why does the thunder always stay out on the ocean?
speaker1: it's the gods arguing. they're working out what to do with lucinnius... he'll be lying awake down there... wondering what they're saying about him.
speaker1: if he goes down i'll ask for my freedom... he owes it to me... he said as much... you too... we could be free...
speaker2: then what?
speaker1: what we talk about.

speaker1: we talk about going home. yours is that way and mine is that way... your family is that way. 
speaker2: i just made that up... i don't know which way they are... anyway ... you can't think like that. not after so many years...
speaker1: it's what you talk about.
speaker2: we talk about it because it can never happen. what we do is you and me...
speaker1: i don't understand. i think you'll leave. you're going to leave me here.
speaker2: never. it's you and me now.
speaker1: well. we stay here. he'll survive.
speaker2: then i can see you every night.

speaker1: can't you find a woman, hector... 
speaker2: sorry to trouble you... just fetching a chicken... good night ... the roof's free...
speaker2: come on, miss, you can tell lucinnius his future.

speaker1: you look happier. 
speaker2: relieved anyway... relieved that it's over at last.

speaker1: will he help you? 
speaker2: i have to kill myself by tomorrow morning. he has all my letters to titinius, none of them got through. he says it's like treason... and he says i should want to die for owing him half a million anyway...
speaker1: what if you don't...

speaker1: then he will... and that wouldn't be pleasant... he would drag me to rome... those letters... 
speaker1: i'm done for, hector... but it's strange... i feel kind of good about it... the struggle is over ... we've seen it through together, eh?
speaker2: i don't know what to say.
speaker1: let's get home. we have a lot to do.
speaker1: tonight... peace at last...

speaker1: we'll do it with a knife, hector. when everyone has gone to bed. 
speaker2: i don't understand. what do you want me to do... i don't think i can help you...
speaker1: we'll help each other, hector. we must. we've been through this whole mess together... we must die together.

speaker1: i don't know what you mean. what mess? 
speaker2: you don't understand do you? i'm asking you to die with me... you're my closest, my dearest slave... what would they say about me if you refused to die with me? this is honor... we're choosing death... we're not going to submit to the humiliations that cyprian can heap on us, are we?
speaker1: you say we... i don't know... what is we? i've done nothing... i know nothing...
speaker2: hector... at cyprian's this morning ... i had to sign certain papers ... tell a bit of a story...

speaker1: what kind of story? 
speaker2: a confession. that we were plotting against cyprian and the provincial senate... we were short of names... most of the people i know were in the room... people i thought were my friends... so i mentioned you... i had to...
speaker1: so i'm a conspirator?
speaker2: yes. so you see, i don't want you to die with me just because of my honor... it's more complicated... i'm sorry, hector. i would be honored... if you would die with me... i mean it...

speaker1: can i sit down? 
speaker2: of course.
speaker1: this is the worst it's been.

speaker1: but even if it's round you can still fall off the edge. 
speaker2: no... it's not round like that... it's round like this.
speaker1: do you believe everything that greek tells you...?
speaker2: rome must be right in the middle... here... and we must be out here somewhere...

speaker1: so, where is my home? 
speaker2: how many months did they march you here?
speaker1: seven.
speaker2: it must be about here.
speaker2: but then you'd be upside down...
speaker1: i wasn't upside down... and how could you see the sun round there ... i saw the sun at home... every day...
speaker2: i'll ask him tomorrow...
speaker1: yes, tell me tomorrow... i'd like to know... because my children are round there and i want to know that they're getting the sun... ask him something else, too... where are the gods if the whole thing is round?
speaker2: i think i know that... they're out here, and all around... that's how they can look down and see everything...

speaker1: if he eats the grain it means yes. 
speaker2: it's saying yes... there's a way...
speaker1: no, it's saying yes, we should die.
speaker2: but you asked it if we had to die, or if there was another way... it's saying yes, there is...
speaker1: no, it's saying yes, we should die.
speaker2: maybe it's just hungry...

speaker1: solus! 
speaker1: solus... i'm eating chicken again. i ate chicken yesterday and the day before... will i be eating chicken again tomorrow? why am i always eating chicken?

speaker1: it's what we have to hand in the kitchen, ma'am... i always try to use the fresh stuff... the chickens have just been turning up... 
speaker2: two men have come to see you. from cyprian.

speaker1: good evening, lucinnius. cyprian asked us if we could be of any assistance... in the business that you have to conduct tonight... to make that business as... comfortable... as you could wish... 
speaker2: thank you, gentlemen... but i feel that i will be capable of taking care of my affairs tonight without your help... thank cyprian for his kind thought...

speaker1: we're spending the night at the house of nepos, not far from here. don't hesitate to send your man for us... at any time... we're anxious that things should go well for you. 
speaker2: thank you. good night.
speaker1: we'll call in the morning at any rate... just to make sure.
speaker2: thank you.
speaker1: you. come here.
speaker1: he looks like the kind that'll want some help. have you ever killed before?
speaker3: only chickens.
speaker1: he's not much different. use a thin blade, but long. get it in deep... the heart... feel for a space between the ribs...
speaker1: ... or go in from the back... any place he'll let you...
speaker1: getting it out's not as easy as you might think... you have to twist a bit... to get over the stickiness...

speaker1: eight hundred sesterces... cash ... that's all that's left... what a failure... my father left me three farms and forty thousand... 
speaker1: nothing else to be done. don't you want some wine?
speaker2: no... but i want something...
speaker1: what is it?
speaker2: i want to die a free man... i don't want to die a slave...
speaker1: hector, by this proclamation, i make you a freed man... i don't know the exact words... i've never done it before... but you're free, hector.

speaker1: in writing... so that when they find me... they know i died a free man... please... 
speaker2: very well...

speaker1: they'll find it in the morning. it's a nice thought, hector... you were right to ask. 
speaker2: thank you.
speaker1: well... freed man, let's do it.

speaker1: what do you want me to do? 
speaker2: nothing... i mean, not to me... i have to do it first... you understand that... and then you... if i don't succeed... then you must help me...
speaker1: i understand.
speaker2: no point in messing up the room. let's go downstairs.

speaker1: oh, that hurts, that stings! 
speaker1: this is hopeless.
speaker1: help me, hector...
speaker2: you've done it... you've done it ... lie down...
speaker2: close your eyes... you did it...
speaker1: thank you, thank you.
speaker1: you do it now, hector... hurry...
speaker2: lie still... lie still...
speaker1: do it hector... do it... you promised...
speaker2: shush... i'll need the knife...

speaker1: take it... do it... 
speaker1: do it, hector... do it... do it...
speaker1: do it... do it... do it...

speaker1: i have some mail for tyre... where are the east-bound ships? 
speaker2: ask at the harbor.
speaker1: we want a timber ship... they go west... straight to rome...
speaker3: and then? then you go home?
speaker1: you can go to anywhere from rome.

speaker1: he's on the ship. 
speaker2: good morning, captain... i'm looking for passage to rome, for both of us...
speaker3: and who might you be?
speaker2: i'm the steward of lucinnius the merchant... we have business in rome... i need an immediate passage...
speaker3: it's five or six days... to brundisium... you can walk or ride from there... you have money?
speaker2: of course.

speaker1: well, let's see... passage for two... food for two... six days... 
speaker2: when do you leave?
speaker1: anxious to leave, are you?
speaker2: keen to start, yes.

speaker1: have you been on a ship before? 
speaker2: yes, of course.
speaker1: me, too, but they kept us down there.
speaker1: tonight... we'll be where the thunder is!
speaker3: thought you would like to see them.
speaker3: your master's ships... going home...

speaker1: no... they can't be... they're lost... 
speaker2: no they're not... i know these ships... my brother-in-law's the master of the big one with the brown sail...
speaker2: somebody been putting the wind up lucinnius? that's an old one... didn't think anybody'd fall for that...

speaker1: we want to praise because we live in this ultimate age, when all things are done, all is known, all the wonders of his creation revealed to us... nothing more for man to see or do... all that is left is the hope of salvation... even for our humbler sisters... 
speaker1: yes weep, child, weep for joy... you are a glorious example to us all... already a child of god's... blessed to spend your earthly days within his church as christ's servant... what generous parents you have... giving you to the sisters... what a sacrifice.
speaker2: she's already received the last rites, before she left her family. she belongs to now... don't you?
speaker1: fortunate child, destined for paradise. untouched by the abiding curse of carnal lust. i struggle against it...

speaker1: i will not join myself carnally with any woman... 
speaker1: ... i will carry my unspilt seed from this world to the next... as should every man...
speaker1: ... if all men forsook forever the fleshy temptations... and held womankind to barrenness... think how much the sooner would come the day of judgement... all chosen gathered in paradise... i've written a small treatise in favor of virginity, sister. we could discuss it later if you like...
speaker2: what are you talking about?
speaker1: it's simple, brother... if we cease carnal union entirely then in fifty or so years we'll all be rid of our earthly lives and can proceed with his reign over his heavenly kingdom... that same paradise that gave to man before, but which man was so unfit to inhabit that within seven hours eve was already tempting her master and mate, and within nine hours the lord had to expel the both of them! just think, they messed it up in nine hours!

speaker1: a bit cold... walking... 
speaker1: how long to get there?
speaker2: when it gets dark, we'll be there.

speaker1: i thought i heard fighting... back there... 
speaker2: i don't know what you're saying... i haven't understood anything you've said all day...
speaker1: i don't know what you're saying...
speaker2: i don't know what you're saying.
speaker1: i don't understand.
speaker3: i want to go home to my mother.

speaker1: i'm starving. do you think i dare heat that up on the fire? 
speaker1: no... i'll eat it cold... i deserve to suffer.

speaker1: have some wine. 
speaker2: i saw some fighting today... back up the road...
speaker1: so, the mad knights are at it again... what were they, swiss or english?
speaker2: i don't know. they all look the same to me.
speaker1: it might help us get through... if there's a bit of confusion... we'll still travel separately though, for now.
speaker1: but, hector, you must keep out of the way of temptation... i saw the way you were eyeing up that widow... now stay away from that... although she is beautiful, is she not... but we're going home, remember.
speaker2: how do you know she's a widow?
speaker1: look at her eyes... hungry eyes... she could lead you into trouble... she smells like paradise, though.

speaker1: listen, hector, let's get this clear... if anyone's going to dally with that widow it'll be me... you couldn't handle her... she'd bewitch you... at any rate, you're not a sinning kind of fellow, are you... why don't you get off up the road tomorrow, and i'll catch you up, in five or so days... hector doesn't answer, but smiles. the priest has 
speaker1: you're not a sinning fellow, remember... another month and we'll be at the channel, then home... the little ones you only talk about when you're drunk... don't forget them...
speaker1: why do i always talk so much... you weren't even thinking of her 'til i opened my mouth... but i trust you... don't worry. i know you wouldn't do anything to anger your or me. get me some bread.
speaker1: who saved your neck in venice?
speaker2: you did, ronald.
speaker1: and don't you forget it.
speaker1: may the lord forgive us our sins, those we have committed and those we as yet only dream of. she's a glory of a woman.

speaker1: hostages, too, they've got... they only take the rich ones... 
speaker1: have you ever seen so many fine, rich men, my girl?
speaker2: i won't be travelling today.
speaker3: the fighting's behind us, brother ... you'll be safe enough.
speaker2: i'll stay.
speaker3: you should go.

speaker1: we're going. will protect his ewe lambs. 
speaker2: must be sore in there. is it your dada?
speaker3: if he's got a little head it might be alright. has your dada got a big head?
speaker4: is there a blacksmith here?
speaker5: in the village, sir, half a day away.
speaker4: you, priest, come here... get to work on him... he's not ready for heaven yet... there's a hundred thousand livres on his head if i get him to paris alive... start praying... there's fifteen livres in it for you if he lives...

speaker1: no, i don't, i don't understand a word. 
speaker2: how come you don't speak like anyone else? are you far from home? home? where you sleep and live?
speaker1: i think i know what you mean...
speaker2: i'm far from home, too... way, way over there... then across the sea...
speaker1: you're losing me again.
speaker2: have you ever seen the sea? water everywhere... right to the end of the world... i come from the other side of the little water, then there's the big, big water... i had a friend who sailed on that... went too far... fell right over the edge... into nothing. they never came back... they fell off the world...
speaker2: you think that's funny? it's true... it's a sad story... you shouldn't laugh.
speaker1: talk about home again... remember you said home?
speaker2: i'm not making sense, am i? well, let's go back to homes. that's where i'm going... i've been away for too long... some people locked me up... i had to run away.

speaker1: we have to learn to talk the same... try it like me, say it... 
speaker2: i know what you're saying... you're saying home... say something else.
speaker1: home... home... try it... home...
speaker2: you want the word for home? it's home... say it... home... home...
speaker1: i don't want your word for home, i want you to say mine... home...
speaker2: come on, you can do it... home... home...
speaker1: home... home...
speaker2: that's it... clever boy!
speaker2: tick... it's a tick.
speaker1: flea... a flea... thanks.

speaker1: bet there's more in there. you need a good going over... nobody's been looking after you. 
speaker2: why don't we go somewhere and have a good session... i could do you... i'd like to give you a good grooming...

speaker1: how is he? 
speaker2: sleeping now... at peace, for the moment.
speaker1: leave him for a while. there are a few souls out here you can help on their way to heaven. ten sous a soul to you... come on.
speaker3: twenty sous is normal. how many are there?

speaker1: that's four. 
speaker2: yes, it does feel good.
speaker1: you can do me now.
speaker2: got one... a tiny little one... yours are so small... and fair...
speaker2: i don't know your name. i'm hector... who are you? i'm hector.
speaker1: hector... yes... i'm beatrice...
speaker2: beatrice.
speaker1: yes. hector... i think you'll have to do under my arms... i'm a little itchy there...

speaker1: yes, i think beatrice is a good name. beatrice is sighing contentedly now. 
speaker2: maybe we should find the river, and have a proper wash...
speaker2: i'm still itchy lots of places, hector.

speaker1: goodbye, little girl... the lord will bless you, i know, in his house. 
speaker1: how long for you on the road?
speaker2: three or four days.
speaker1: good luck to you.
speaker2: they're not killing nuns, yet.
speaker1: the saxon, won't he go with you?

speaker1: my name is peter... don't forget ... tell everybody that was my name... peter... 
speaker2: lie still, peter...
speaker1: that's it, peter... tell everybody ... write it... don't forget it... peter... tell them peter died here ... my name is peter... peter... say it again.
speaker2: peter...

speaker1: you're a busy man, what with all these souls departing. 
speaker2: there's nothing wrong with helping someone to die in peace. they want me to go with them.
speaker1: nothing at all.
speaker2: are you staying here?
speaker1: moving on, as you told me to... we'll meet up, like you said.

speaker1: she'll do you harm. i told you. she might be a witch. wait for me. i still have the money from venice. we can be home in a month. 
speaker2: witch my arse. stop giving me orders.
speaker2: you're a strange fellow. are you a priest? are you jealous?
speaker3: we're moving soon, father.

speaker1: so, you're leaving? 
speaker2: you have work to do here.
speaker2: i don't understand you.

speaker1: i'm glad we're going the same way. 
speaker2: we'll have to sleep in the hills tonight. will you keep me warm?

speaker1: hurry up and finish your wine and then we can make love. 
speaker2: why do you smell so wonderful?
speaker1: oh, you like my smell, do you? i make it from the flowers. i put it here, and there, and there.
speaker1: i don't believe it... someone's watching us, the dirty devil... don't look... he's down by the water, by the rocks...

speaker1: cheeky devil. 
speaker2: he's not moving. he must've seen us, though.

speaker1: it's a dead man. 
speaker1: come on, we're going that way at any rate.

speaker1: no sign of a battle... only a few horses... or just one. he wasn't killed in a fight. 
speaker2: poor boy. isn't he fine-looking. look at his shoes.
speaker2: we'll cover his eyes at least... so the crows don't get him. look at these shoes, though.
speaker1: that's good of you.

speaker1: it's all we can do. it won't keep the wolves away though. 
speaker2: his feet are like mine, you know. i'll give you mine, poor boy, and i'll have yours. i have more walking to do.
speaker2: it's not stealing if i give him mine, is it?

speaker1: you're eager today, hector, aren't you? is it all this death? 
speaker2: i don't know what you're saying but i like you when you talk.
speaker1: that should help him a little.
speaker2: we should go now. we've been here too long.
speaker1: i wonder if his mama will ever know what happened.
speaker2: you said mama. i know what that is... mama... we can talk the same...
speaker1: mama... that's right... mama...

speaker1: i have to keep the sun on my back, that's what ronald said... the sun on my back all the way home... i'll stay on this side of the river... 
speaker2: yes, of course... we stay on this side of the river, all the way down... until tomorrow...
speaker1: i stay on this side...
speaker2: yes... on this side. then the other.

speaker1: here we are... home... you want some food... and then i'll show you everything. we have a spring ... you can wash... 
speaker1: this is when i wish you could understand me. you'll have to learn, you know... i want you to stay here. you want to, don't you?
speaker1: i look after the hens, and i make dyes from the plants, and perfumes too. i'm good at that. but i'm no good with the sheep and the goats. i wish you could understand... arnaud's been dead two years...

speaker1: i still have his clothes. i'll make them fit you... 
speaker2: what did he die of?
speaker1: i'm getting shy. imagine me being shy with you... i made this for him... tonight we'll try them on. you're the same height as arnaud, but a little thinner. i'll make them fit. i'm a good sewer. and we have a big bed upstairs for you and me, in the rafters... you and me... sleep...
speaker1: i like you. you like me too, don't you? we were lucky to meet the way we did. all the men around here are old.
speaker1: come up and i'll show you the bed...

speaker1: a good bed, eh? for you and me. we can have fun up here... better than a ditch... 
speaker2: mama, are you home?

speaker1: you were gone a long time. who's this? 
speaker2: this is hector.
speaker2: these are my children...
speaker2: ... and this is my mother....
speaker3: so... you found one, eh?

speaker1: is there water... to drink... to wash? 
speaker2: take hector to the well... but come here first.

speaker1: we can't have this... this was arnaud's seat... it's yours now... i can sit on the box... 
speaker2: you must sit there... look... you need the light from the window... it's your seat... i don't want it... it's yours... i can sit on the box.
speaker2: ah...
speaker2: good color... for cloth?

speaker1: ugh... 
speaker1: peepee?

speaker1: i have to leave soon. i can't stay... it would be wrong to stay for just a while... 
speaker1: i have to go... have to keep the sun on my back... i have to get home... i have a family, just like you... i like you... you smell good... wonderful...

speaker1: i had a wonderful dream. i was lying under a tree, beside a river. i was dozing. i heard the water... beautiful clear water. i got up and drank some. i think i ate some raspberries too. 
speaker2: i would like some water.
speaker1: this is the worst, the worst.
speaker3: let me keep him... they said we'll find land in a day or so... you're evil...
speaker4: when they're dead they go over the side... the place stinks enough as it is...
speaker2: do you think i'll still see europe?
speaker1: i think there's more chance of me eating you, andre.

speaker1: i think today will be the day, my friends. we've been in the inshore currents since yesterday. three crowns to the first one to sight the coast. preserve us all. 
speaker2: never mind the three crowns... a side of beef would do... or a drink of clean water.
speaker1: don't worry, there'll be food for all ashore. africa's full of meat and drink.
speaker2: it's full of africans too.

speaker1: how many made it? 
speaker2: eighty men. ten women. eighteen children and forty-five slaves.
speaker1: two parties of ten men each... one to the north and one to the south... bring back what you can... game, fruit, anything... and send someone back as soon as you find fresh water. any trouble, discharge three shots.

speaker1: i have a carpet and some cloth... i thought if we worked together we could make a better shelter... 
speaker2: if it's a joke it's a poor one.
speaker1: at least ask dona ursula...
speaker2: i don't have to ask her... i know she would agree with me... leave us alone.
speaker1: well... would you take my cloth, at least?
speaker2: keep it and build your own hovel somewhere else... leave us alone...!

speaker1: they ran off with the dry bread... about eight of them, sir... dom paulo looks at the two prisoners. 
speaker2: you men are deserters. you will die tomorrow.
speaker2: chain them on the raft for tonight, and watch them...
speaker3: i must object... these sentences can't be lawful...
speaker2: do you think so?
speaker3: of course... we can't allow ourselves to fall into terror and violence...
speaker2: you're right... but then how can we punish them? we can't lock them up...

speaker1: you were right the first time, sir... they must hang... they were stealing the bread from our mouths... 
speaker2: i didn't steal any bread... gomes had the bread... he's off, in the forest...
speaker3: oh dear...
speaker3: what do you think, father?
speaker4: i'll comfort them whether they live or die, now or later, any of you, all of you... i'll comfort you all.
speaker1: hang them... you have to set an example...
speaker3: so i was right the first time?
speaker5: no, sir... there must be proper justice...
speaker3: what's proper justice?
speaker6: i didn't steal any bread...

speaker1: you have to make a decision, sir. 
speaker2: it was gomes... he told us to run.
speaker3: i'll decide... no i won't... we'll all decide... most of the people that matter are here... we'll have a vote... who agrees with salgado... and me... that they should die?
speaker3: ... and those against death...
speaker3: you can't vote...
speaker3: can he?
speaker1: it doesn't matter.
speaker1: i don't think this is working, dom paulo... we need authority... you must decide...
speaker3: very well... da cunha?

speaker1: the cross the carpenter is working on... tell him to turn it into a scaffold... have it erected along the beach, away from the women... the executions will be at sunrise tomorrow. tell father diogo. 
speaker1: take them to the raft.
speaker1: everyone in agreement with hanging? or should we shoot them... or what?
speaker2: hanging is fine, sir.

speaker1: very well... now... who's going to conduct the executions... should we pick someone, or have a volunteer... 
speaker1: hector?
speaker2: i'll do it, dom paulo.
speaker1: thank you, alvarez. sunrise tomorrow. send the priest to them tonight.

speaker1: good work, andre. 
speaker1: hector turns to andre.
speaker1: you go and sleep by the big fire, andre. keep warm.

speaker1: senor hector? 
speaker1: this was all they found in the forest. four for each of us. they taste kind of milky, but sour.
speaker2: thank you, nuno.
speaker1: my mother ate three and she was sick. so try two... but she's sick anyway... maybe you can try three...

speaker1: i'll start with two. 
speaker2: hector, will you help me?
speaker2: lopo... the boy they're going to hang tomorrow... he was cook's cabin boy... i was going to take him something to eat... i thought, perhaps, one of yours and one of mine...
speaker2: you said you might just eat two...
speaker1: but there's tomorrow, nuno... we must eat tomorrow too...
speaker1: dom paulo would call it a waste. you must keep yourself strong, nuno, that's what he'd say... so that you can help the others... knows what we have ahead of us... we'll need strong people like you...
speaker1: try not to think about lopo any more... the guards wouldn't let you near him anyway.
speaker1: goodnight!

speaker1: some gunpowder would scatter them, sir. 
speaker2: no, they might want to be friendly... they'll have food too... get one of our african slaves... we must try and talk to them... if they think we're timid we're dead.

speaker1: i hate it when people have to die. 
speaker2: it's foolishness. killing our own men when we have the whole of africa to face.
speaker1: it's foolish squabbling at all. we should be friends.
speaker2: what's this?
speaker1: some bread and raisins.
speaker2: i thought everything was shared out on the raft...
speaker1: well this wasn't. it's for her... and you.

speaker1: i must speak to her! 
speaker2: they want to make a visit here... with their king... he will bring gifts, and will receive gifts. they said not to sacrifice anymore men for them... they don't like that...

speaker1: turtles' eggs, sir... doctor correa was shipping them to the royal zoo... i think they hoped some of them would hatch. 
speaker2: well... it's eggs for supper tonight... for everyone...

speaker1: how are they? 
speaker2: good.
speaker1: yours were fine?
speaker2: yes.
speaker2: good night.

speaker1: have you any eggs left? 
speaker2: the slaves only got three. i want to ask you something.
speaker1: you were lucky. what?
speaker2: i want my real name back.
speaker1: you don't like andre anymore?
speaker2: i think of my home all the time. i want to hear the name they call me. we should die with our real names.
speaker1: we're not going to die, andre...
speaker1: i've forgotten your name...
speaker2: ketabomago pululo.
speaker1: now i remember why we called you andre.
speaker1: i will, andre... i promise... i'll call you that... when i remember...
speaker1: good night... keta...
speaker2: ketabomago pululo...
speaker1: yes... good night...

speaker1: how many are sick? 
speaker2: about fifty, sir, some of them very sick indeed. it's the eggs. a couple of the crates were full of rotten ones, but eaten just the same. others just ate too many. it would have been better to ration them, i suppose.
speaker1: how wise of you to think of that now. any deaths?
speaker2: six.
speaker1: how many eggs did you have?

speaker1: three. i had them boiled. 
speaker2: i had four. i don't feel well now...
speaker1: four's all right... the really ill ones had eaten eight, ten...
speaker2: let's not think about it... what have you got?
speaker3: it worked well... they'll go for this... and nails... luis cleaned up a sackful from the crates...
speaker2: organize some men to gather all the nails they can find. we have to keep control of that particular currency.

speaker1: stop that... leave her alone... get back to the camp... or i'll tell your mother... how can you play like this when there are people needing your help back there...? 
speaker1: come back... i didn't mean it... it was a joke... you come back... she's still here... i won't say anything...

speaker1: he was excited when he heard you had come, but he wants to know if you are real people... he didn't think you would be such a strange color... so he wants to see your... 
speaker1: ... so that he will know that you were born like real people...

speaker1: right... you four as well... 
speaker2: he wants to see you breathe.
speaker1: tell him that we want to trade with him, to buy food... and we want him to guide us out of here... we have a long way to travel... to where the white men have their big ships...
speaker2: he has heard of white men very, very far away... this way... but you have to cross many rivers...
speaker1: tell him i want to give him these...

speaker1: ... and tell him that i want to make him a very special gift as one king to another... 
speaker1: of these precious things, which my fathers and forefathers have worn for many long years before...
speaker1: i shouldn't do this, but it is such a special occasion, and he is such a great and worthy king...
speaker2: he says he could not accept such a treasured gift, something of such value to your family... instead he would be happy to take one or two of the old rings you have on your fingers... but please do not insist that he take your necklace...
speaker2: he will give you guides to help you across the first of the big rivers... it is ten days from here...

speaker1: thank you, thank you... 
speaker2: ... and he asks you to be ready to leave the beach in two days time... he cannot permit you to stay longer...
speaker2: because with the new moon the turtles will arrive and lay their eggs... you may frighten them... you must be gone...

speaker1: out the marrow... it's the best bit. 
speaker1: i'm sorry about today...
speaker2: it doesn't matter...
speaker1: but it does... it was mean of me... i was upset at something...
speaker2: i know.

speaker1: you don't think too badly of me? 
speaker2: no...
speaker1: you still like me?

speaker1: you do? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: well, that makes me feel better... we all have to like each other... and respect each other... that's important too.
speaker1: if you don't respect me, just say so...

speaker1: i have a boy like you... maybe you could meet him when we get home... 
speaker1: you can take her back there tomorrow, eh?
speaker2: no... she's sick now...

speaker1: can't you be more accurate? 
speaker2: how can i be accurate without instruments? as it is i'm sighting the sun with two pieces of wood... call it five hundred and be done with it... he said twenty rivers.

speaker1: we just want you to be as accurate as we know you can be, dias. after all, the ship did manage to find that rock with admirable precision. 
speaker2: confound you, dom paulo, that's an insult... she hit that rock because she was taking water and unsteerable... she was overloaded before she left india and you know it....
speaker2: i've told you... we vote for a leader or you can walk into the jungle on your own... it should have been done days ago...
speaker3: calm down, dias... you can't stay here forever, living on turtles' eggs...
speaker3: what about the sick and the injured, dom paulo...?
speaker1: i've discussed it with father diogo... i don't see how a hundred of us can carry seventy sick...
speaker4: i'm going to search the scriptures tonight. i'm sure that has an answer to it.
speaker2: an excuse, you mean... we'll be leaving them here to die...
speaker5: oh, so you're coming with us now, dias!

speaker1: after the vote... 
speaker2: it might be the best we can offer them now... the chance to die a good christian death here, and set an example to the heathens...

speaker1: i'll be glad when we're on the move... the sound of the sea is driving me mad. 
speaker2: good night, hector...
speaker1: where is ursula? sleeping?
speaker2: sick. she hasn't been able to rise since yesterday.

speaker1: will you share a bottle of wine with me? i've had it since we left the ship... i want to drink it tonight, with you. 
speaker2: you have a bottle of wine?

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: well, fetch it.

speaker1: you should hang for this. some people on the raft might have lived with a glass of this in their stomach... 
speaker2: i know. i feel very guilty. i brought this too...
speaker2: honeyed fruit. the last i have.
speaker1: you rogue... give it here...
speaker2: i brought it for ursula...
speaker1: much too rich for her... do you want to kill her?
speaker2: surely... some fruit couldn't...

speaker1: don't argue with me, old friend... you're the guilty one around here, and don't you forget it. 
speaker2: why is it always me? why am i always guilty, always sorry... am i so bad?
speaker1: with ursula you weren't bad, you were stupid... you did the one thing you can't do to a strong woman... you took away her pride... what else can she do but hate you?
speaker1: and then you get on the same ship...
speaker2: i had to get home... just like you...
speaker1: and when the ship went down... why did you have to get on the same raft... it was as if you were trying to torment her...
speaker2: but... the other raft was sinking...
speaker1: so?
speaker2: francisco... please...

speaker1: yes... they will look after the sick... but the king would like one thing... the machine that makes music... 
speaker2: we need food as well... ten cows... to take with us... then the king can have the music.

speaker1: you must come with us. 
speaker2: no.

speaker1: your mother might not get well... 
speaker2: that's why i have to stay.
speaker3: and afterwards... what will you do then?
speaker2: follow you and the others.
speaker3: alone?
speaker1: let him be.

speaker1: i'll comfort them as best as i can. 
speaker2: you're staying with them?
speaker1: no, no, i'll comfort them before we leave. i think my place is with you...

speaker1: francisco... i have to see her before we leave. 
speaker2: i'll ask her.
speaker2: in you go.

speaker1: ursula... it's hector. 
speaker1: we're leaving soon. i've come to say goodbye...

speaker1: goodbye. 
speaker2: i won't forget you... i won't forget india... i can't forget how i hurt you... she looks at him but doesn't or cannot speak.
speaker2: we should have talked... i could have explained... many things...
speaker1: lisbon...
speaker2: yes... i'll pray for you in lisbon... at the cathedral...
speaker2: i'm sorry i hurt your pride...
speaker1: what? what did you say? what are you talking about?
speaker2: nothing, nothing...
speaker1: 
speaker2: ursula?

speaker1: we won't forget you, or what you are doing for these poor people... 
speaker2: i'm not staying here with the intention of dying, dom paulo... we'll be following you... when we are fit and well...
speaker1: yes, of course...
speaker2: ... and good luck to you...
speaker1: protect you... it breaks my heart to leave you all here, but i don't know what else i can do.
speaker1: we're leaving the cross with you...
speaker2: oh, thank you...
speaker3: it's too heavy to carry... and who knows... it might make some impression on the heathens.
speaker4: francisco, i must talk to you alone...

speaker1: yes. i think so... 
speaker2: thank, well, goodbye.
speaker1: is there anything that i can do for you? a letter... a message? francisco laughs softly.
speaker2: no... if you were carrying something for me i would have to worry about you... if you go empty-handed i can put you out of my mind!
speaker1: i want to ask you something. there's no easy way to do it...
speaker2: go on, hector...
speaker1: your boots...
speaker2: what about them?
speaker1: can i have them? you can have mine... they'll be fine for here... but i have to walk six hundred miles...
speaker2: yes, you're right... i daresay my boots would take you six hundred miles... i look after them... hector becomes almost poetic in his pleading.

speaker1: i'll walk all the way home, francisco... i'll pray for your soul in the cathedral in lisbon... 
speaker2: ... in my boots...
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: hector, you have surpassed yourself... sit down and take my boots!
speaker1: they were made by da fosca, weren't they?
speaker2: the best bootmaker in goa... pray for my soul in lisbon, hector... and pray for your own...

speaker1: how long? 
speaker2: they've been gone a week, at least.
speaker1: them...
speaker2: we're ten days late...
speaker2: cheer up. have a look around.

speaker1: it's sandy's... whiskey... 
speaker2: well done, my lad!

speaker1: even if we lose their track, we'll still hit the river... we can't miss that. 
speaker2: it's too high for indians?
speaker1: much too high. you won't find an indian up here. we just have to keep our heads... no panic.
speaker2: if you did find an indian, what would he be?
speaker1: you wouldn't... but he might be a delaware if you did.
speaker2: we keep working?
speaker1: why not. we can log the peaks on the far side, just a couple of sightings a day... keep us busy...
speaker2: you think we'll get out?
speaker1: if we keep our heads. i wish i had some tobacco.

speaker1: barometer... twenty-eight and three-eighths... temperature... low... thirty-four... high... forty-two and a half... time... 
speaker1: it's getting worse... you're nearly five minutes fast now...
speaker2: i'm not fast... you're slowing down. they obviously have this tiff every morning.
speaker2: what's the point of having two chronometers when you don't take the average?
speaker1: exactly... you should throw yours away.
speaker2: you're unscientific, bobby... at heart...
speaker2: seven twenty-five...

speaker1: i see her in the dewy flowers i see her sweet and fair... 
speaker1: there's not a bonny bird that sings but minds me o' my jean...

speaker1: sure this is a good idea. 
speaker2: let's get out of here.

speaker1: hi! hello! 
speaker1: hey, come back... we're just moving through... don't apologize... we all got a fright...

speaker1: that was stupid... 
speaker2: did you see him?
speaker1: sure i saw him.
speaker2: was he a delaware?
speaker1: how the should i know? he was an indian... and indians don't come in ones...
speaker2: yeah... i think he was an indian too... what about the horse?
speaker1: i'm not going back down there.
speaker2: don't panic, bobby...
speaker1: why not?
speaker1: come on!

speaker1: same as you. 
speaker2: an indian... with long hair...
speaker1: that's it... kind of short...
speaker2: yeah... he was't tall...
speaker1: that's the one.
speaker2: let's get a bit further up.
speaker1: what've you got in there?
speaker2: some food, the logbooks, my letters, a candle...
speaker1: a gun?
speaker2: no.

speaker1: we won't have a fire tonight. we should make a shelter though, in case it snows. 
speaker2: what about bears, without a fire?
speaker1: don't even think about bears, hector.

speaker1: maybe he's lost too... on his own... must be delaware... they were chased up here years ago... everybody thought they'd cleared off west... the other side of ohio... they were an angry lot... no wonder... they used to farm on the coast. 
speaker1: go on, read it out...
speaker2: what? no... not tonight...
speaker1: i've had to listen to it every night since april... why not now?
speaker2: dear, father, i miss you. three frogs are dead. everybody misses you. bring me a bear's head and claws and a gun. school is good. miss white has married a fireman. come back soon. do not worry about the frogs, they did not have names. nathaniel.
speaker2: it's not so funny now as it was.

speaker1: it wasn't funny then. 
speaker2: if you knew him... if you could picture him saying it... it would be funnier.
speaker1: i had a father like you... nine months on a whaler and then three weeks at home telling us all how much he missed us...
speaker2: i'm going home, for the winter...
speaker1: smell it?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: goddam it... smell it?
speaker2: tobacco?
speaker1: where the is it coming from?
speaker1: i can't tell... a night like this it could carry for miles...
speaker1: i wish i had a smoke.

speaker1: i was saving it... you have it... 
speaker2: what do you mean, you were saving it? you know the rules... no hoarding, tobacco or food... you've listened to me for a month, day and night... wanting a smoke...
speaker1: well have it now... i don't smoke...
speaker2: you've kept it from me, and you don't even use it...
speaker1: i was saving it for my birthday...
speaker2: i have to wait until your birthday for a smoke? who are you... the king?
speaker1: go on, smoke it... have it now...
speaker2: i won't... i'm not smoking on your command... i won't.
speaker2: your poor children... what do they have to do for a piece of candy in your house? it's very hard to like you sometimes... d'you know that?
speaker1: i know, bobby... but that's how i feel about you, too... that's why we're friends... we try hard...

speaker1: no... i'll have it in the morning. 
speaker2: come on... tell me... who would you rather be sitting here with... have a think...
speaker1: daniel boone?
speaker2: yeah. he would be a help... but after daniel boone...
speaker1: i can't think of anyone else... but you're impossible to like sometimes.
speaker1: we should sleep. we've got a lot of running to do in the morning.
speaker2: no we're not... we're going to talk... all night...
speaker2: so... where do you want to start?
speaker2: i know where you want to start...
speaker2: alicia...

speaker1: well... what about alicia? 
speaker2: i'm sorry...
speaker1: no... i'm sorry...
speaker2: what do you mean, you're sorry... i'm the one that has to apologize...
speaker1: oh no you're not...

speaker1: isn't it a beautiful day? 
speaker2: i've said who we are and where we're headed. want to sign it, write anything?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: the peak we logged yesterday... i've named it nathanial mountain. after my boy... is that fine with you?
speaker1: i was going to call it tobacco mountain... or mount alicia... but nathaniel's fine...

speaker1: let's get away from here. 
speaker2: north?
speaker1: yeah. keep the sun on our backs.

speaker1: what's wrong? 
speaker2: quiet. they're on the other side...

speaker1: we're right in the middle of them... 
speaker2: does it have to be bad? they might be friendly...
speaker1: they were chased here... they should be on the coast growing corn...
speaker1: oh-oh...
speaker2: what's wrong?
speaker1: they're behind us. they must think we're stalking the women...
speaker1: do you want to run?
speaker2: i'll do what you do.

speaker1: when they catch up... fight... it'll be quicker... fight like hell... 
speaker2: they're not going to catch us. we're going home.
speaker2: hold my hand, bobby...

speaker1: do you know the lady, mr. troup? 
speaker2: think you'll go to jail again?
speaker3: look here for a second, will you, mr. troup?
speaker1: will you talk to us when you come out?

speaker1: you guys are downstairs... third floor... thirty-eight... 
speaker1: you're forty-eight.

speaker1: this is troup! 
speaker2: come here, troup. i'm cobb.
speaker2: you bring everything?
speaker3: what?
speaker2: building warrant, license, fire certificate, sanitation certificate... i want them all... this is mr. santiago, from the city... insurance...

speaker1: this isn't really my building... it's my partner's... i just took the call and came right over... i have to leave town in an hour or so anyway... 
speaker2: slow down, troup... so it's 3:15 on a friday... you're staying here 'til mr. santiago gets the paperwork... get your partner over here, with everything... this is serious...

speaker1: i might have to close the place down. 
speaker2: where is she?
speaker3: i phoned you monday... i told you the floor was making noises...
speaker2: not me, mrs. philippopolis... my ex-partner... i think you spoke to him... how are you feeling? hector says this clearly, for the benefit of the
speaker4: come back from there, troup, the floor's still moving...

speaker1: i'll make a couple of calls... i'll straighten it out... is she bad? 
speaker2: they waited for a portable x-ray machine... they can move her now.
speaker1: she seems in good spirits...
speaker3: wait 'til my son sees his mother lying here like this... he's gonna sue you... you're a lousy landlord... you should be ashamed... to let old people live like this... i phoned you monday... i have a witness! i was dancing with a prince on my eighteenth birthday, and now look at me... you have me falling down a toilet!

speaker1: anna... thank you have to help me... i'm still in queens... i've got cops here and everything ... i need your car... i don't have time to pick up the rental now... they won't let me leave the building... you come down here... and put my bag in the car... no.. i have to pick the kids up by six, otherwise i up her weekend too... she'll kill me... this is an emergency... what can i say? please... right... okay... 
speaker2: it looks like water rotted the floor... you have any plumbing maintenance records?
speaker1: at the office... i might have some bills... it's not my building.
speaker2: it's a weird one... i don't know how water could sit in there for so long without somebody noticing ... you didn't use water-resistent paint on the ceilings did you?
speaker1: i don't really know...
speaker2: you're going to have to check out the whole building... you know that, don't you?
speaker1: can i do it monday?
speaker2: good joke... it'll take you a month.

speaker1: can i speak with leonard, please... mr. deutsch? my name is hector troup, borlonski and troup, real estate... 
speaker1: leonard... it's hector... borlonski and troup... yes... listen, we've had a domestic accident at our eighth street building... a floor ... and an old lady... she did mention the word sue, but it might have been hysterics... what i need to know is what certificates you have on file for the building... i know it's friday... just do one thing... let me know if the insurance is current... i need to know that... i'm on my mobile... anything you have... before five ... thank you...
speaker2: my son's downstairs... when he sees me like this he'll kill you... go on... jump through the hole... see what it feels like! break both legs! hector is almost tempted to do what she says.

speaker1: mr. troup, i'm george philippopolis. 
speaker2: i'm sorry about your mother...
speaker1: well... it's happened... you want to travel with us, or do you have a car?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: to the hospital...
speaker2: well, i wasn't planning to...
speaker1: you're not making a visit to the hospital?

speaker1: i've talked to your mother, given her my best wishes... she wants her family with her now... any other friday but this one. 
speaker2: he's not coming to the hospital...
speaker3: that could look bad...
speaker1: look, george... here's what i can do... i'll visit her on tuesday, i'll organize some flowers...
speaker2: screw the flowers... who's gonna check her into the hospital... who's gonna pay? it's your building that fell down...
speaker2: he nods his head to the policeman.
speaker1: they won't let me leave here...
speaker3: that's true.
speaker2: wait 'til they hear this in court ... he wouldn't even make a trip to the hospital... can't you even give me a credit card number?

speaker1: it's never been this bad, boris. deutsch is checking the insurance... did you bring the rest? 
speaker2: yeah... we're covered for most things... the license is current, the inspection certificate is okay...
speaker1: what's with the we... it's your problem.
speaker2: how is she?
speaker1: she's a witch... her bones must be made of steel... she didn't break a thing... it might help if you make a visit to the hospital...
speaker2: i'm sorry, hector... i just put your name on the lousy forms... i didn't plan this... i just borrowed your name on the titles.
speaker1: i told you to stop doing that... why does this keep happening to me... my name is mine... use your own name, boris borlonski... will you remember that? boris borlonski!
speaker2: hector... forgive me... i'll take care of it... don't let it spoil your weekend... four years, huh? you make the most of it... and don't worry, you'll walk away from this... i'm sorry...

speaker1: yeah, i'm sorry too... you have to get out of this business... i thought i had... 
speaker2: go on... have a great weekend... i'll talk to you on monday... we'll straighten everything out...
speaker1: this is the worst it's been.
speaker2: everything can be fixed... always.
speaker3: get in... you can dropp me at the shop.

speaker1: you bring my bag? 
speaker2: yeah. your camera's in there too. take some photographs of the kids...
speaker1: sure. thanks.
speaker2: nervous?

speaker1: not much... just like i'm being executed... 
speaker2: well you deserve to suffer.
speaker2: don't worry... this is the beginning of something... not the end... you can start being a father again.
speaker1: i'm glad you talked me into it.
speaker2: i didn't do much... you were ready...
speaker1: you're right... you're absolutely right... i was ready... i am ready, for everything... i'm fixing all that with boris... i told him... it can't go on... i want my freedom.
speaker1: ... and the kids... that'll work out... we can have them over sometimes... yeah?
speaker2: sure... that was the plan... when we have the space...
speaker1: right, when we have the space... when we get the bigger apartment...
speaker2: there you go... you said it... the bigger apartment together...

speaker1: yeah... i said it, didn't i? 
speaker2: you're a man of decision, hector...
speaker1: yes i am... together... i said it ... and get out of my car at the corner here... i don't have the time to go 'round the block.
speaker1: thanks... for the car...
speaker2: do the best you can with them, hector... and one more thing... deliver these...
speaker1: what? anna, i can't...
speaker2: here's the address... just two blocks before the bridge... a five minute detour. it's a golden wedding... you have to...
speaker2: we have to help each other...
speaker2: oh, you'll need gas too... go to it, hector...

speaker1: hi, hector. 
speaker2: you made it. the kids are just coming. they're not over the moon about going to the beach house. i ought to warn you.
speaker3: why didn't you say? i could have fixed up something else. i thought it would be a good place to get to know them again...
speaker2: well, i figured you should be allowed to make your own mistakes. it's only for a couple of nights, they can take it... and you'll learn... check into a hotel if it gets too much... they like hotels.
speaker2: come on, you two... your father's ready to go...
speaker2: this is where we'll be, if anything crops up... thanks for the break...
speaker3: maybe this is a bit sudden for them... maybe i should have come over a couple of nights and got to know them...
speaker2: by monday, you'll know them...

speaker1: here he is, the invisible dad. 
speaker1: that's what they call you.
speaker2: hi.
speaker3: hi.
speaker4: hi.
speaker1: you three have a good weekend. if it's too miserable at the house your father said he'll take you to a hotel.
speaker1: good luck, hector.
speaker5: see you monday, hector.
speaker3: are those for mom?

speaker1: oh no... save me... what have i done... 
speaker2: what's wrong?
speaker1: no... i can't face it, not just now...
speaker1: let's go.

speaker1: excuse me, kids... i have to consult the oracle... 
speaker1: hello... god? no, leonard, it's hector... just a joke... sorry to phone you at home, did boris call you? the insurance is fine? good ... but she could claim negligence ... oh, she's got a lawyer already? that's a bad omen...
speaker1: is there anything we can do right now... make her an offer... sure, with the insurance company... sure... you're right... me, too... i have the kids in the car with me right now... sorry to bother you...

speaker1: that's it! the last call... the weekend starts right now... we have things to do... look out for a safeway... we need some supplies... and gas... oh my gas... soon... 
speaker1: want to make any calls? betsy?
speaker1: tom?

speaker1: but we called you tom... that's what it says on your birth certificate...
speaker3: i changed it.
speaker1: right... it's your name... you can do that... safeway... keep your eyes skinned... and i could murder a chicken mcnugget.

speaker1: what's wrong with that? it's a kitchen roll... why can't i pick a kitchen roll? 
speaker2: it's bleached... and it isn't recycled... you don't care... you just buy junk...
speaker1: good point, betsy...
speaker2: everything you buy is junk... i don't eat steak... and what's this...
speaker2: ugh! why don't you ask us what we like... it'll save you money... you buy junk, we won't eat it...
speaker1: you're right.
speaker1: well, get to it... i'll just tag along...
speaker2: i do it every week anyway.

speaker1: she does. she tells us what to eat. we let her. 
speaker2: can i just keep a couple of those steaks? we can't live on chicken.

speaker1: are you going to bring the flowers in? 
speaker2: don't mention the flowers.

speaker1: this is good, tony, the stones are talking to me already... now here's something... travel... movement... tony, are you planning a move... travel... anything? 
speaker2: yes i am... i've been thinking about a move to california...
speaker1: the big one, eh, tony? these stones are really talking here... what are you planning for yourself in california?
speaker2: i'm hoping for an acting career, mel...
speaker1: tony, these stones really like what you're planning... there is no doubt in my mind about that... now listen... you have to be specific... these stones really want to tell you something, be it love, money or the purpose of your life... but i want a specific question from you... think about it... what do you want to know... love... or your income level next year? be as specific as you can, tony...

speaker1: get me the books... all the books... all of the books... no, no, no... not the pancakes... not the pancakes... no... 
speaker1: ... not the pancakes...
speaker2: ... find your true cosmic partner first time around... every weekday morning at three here on the psychic network... lucinda's horoscope dating show... remember there is an answer, and there is a special partner out there for you...
speaker3: ... don't let the oil run out... yes you did... watch the oil... why... why?

speaker1: you don't eat eggs? 
speaker2: how many have you got in there?
speaker1: three. is that all right?
speaker2: for a week, maybe.
speaker1: how about pancakes, betsy... d'you like pancakes?
speaker2: not much... why?
speaker1: i just wondered. pancakes don't mean much to you?
speaker2: they don't mean a thing. why?
speaker1: nothing.
speaker1: i thought we could walk into town this morning. i saw the funfair when we came through last night.
speaker3: we don't go to funfairs.
speaker1: let's take the walk anyway.
speaker3: i brought some books. i want to stay home and read.
speaker1: no. we're taking a walk.

speaker1: it's going to rain... we should stay. 
speaker2: here's an umbrella... and there must be some old coats in here... and shoes... i only have these i'm wearing...
speaker1: donald has some shoes...
speaker2: i don't know if i want to wear donald's shoes.
speaker1: why not?
speaker2: wow. look at this.
speaker2: six years ago. look at that... what's this?
speaker1: that was the flood. the sea came right up. donald says it's the icecap melting. it's going to get worse. that's why mom's selling the place.

speaker1: it comes up every year? 
speaker2: the last two.

speaker1: where are the birds? is it the wrong time of year? 
speaker2: they don't come over so much. the shellfish have gone... that's what...
speaker1: that's what donald says?
speaker2: yes... and it happens to be true.
speaker1: please don't rain... please...

speaker1: let's have a ride... 
speaker2: the seats are wet.

speaker1: kitchen roll, unbleached, 
speaker1: this is ridiculous. let's go somewhere and talk.
speaker2: all right, if you want to...
speaker1: how do we land these things?

speaker1: sure you won't have a pancake, betsy? betsy gets impatient. 
speaker2: no!

speaker1: okay, first question? 
speaker2: where have you been?
speaker3: what he means is why did you stay away?
speaker1: well, that's a fair question... your mother and i got divorced... you're big enough to remember...
speaker3: sure she has... but lots of people get divorced... that doesn't mean they disappear...
speaker1: you're right... what can i tell you... i went kind of crazy after that, for a good while... i came around a few times... remember?
speaker2: not really.
speaker1: well, it wasn't easy... everything with her and donald happened pretty quickly. i missed you both really badly... but for a while i thought i should stay away, until your mother got settled... no, that's not really true... i missed you... but i was kind of crazy at the same time... your mother and i married young... i wasn't used to the freedom... it went to my head ... then you moved to new jersey.

speaker1: it's forty minutes away on a slow bus... 
speaker2: you're right, you're right. i don't have too many excuses for the first year... the second year is easier... i was in jail. hector is pleased with this. a solid excuse.
speaker3: what for?
speaker2: we were doing government work, big contracts... there were some temptations... my boss asked me to shuffle a few papers... there was a lot of money in it... i had to testify against him... it was like killing somebody.
speaker1: thomas wanted to visit you in jail, but mom wouldn't let him. hector looks at thomas.
speaker2: you did?
speaker2: well i appreciate that... but i'm glad your mother didn't let you. i'll tell you all about it some day. it was no fun. one year and eight months.
speaker3: we didn't even know when you got out.

speaker1: i wasn't in great shape... i sure didn't want you to see me then... so i got back to work... in real estate... found a partner, we met in jail... 
speaker1: no. he's a good man, a good man. i like him. i mean it. he's my friend.
speaker2: that's what you do now?
speaker1: yes. we rent apartments... but we want to get into commercial property... people are a nuisance... does that sound bad?
speaker2: how should i know?
speaker1: just recently i've been feeling good, things have been going well... and i missed you two...
speaker2: what about your girl friend?
speaker1: who told you about her?
speaker2: nobody.
speaker1: anna... she's nice... she wants to meet you, real soon... she sells flowers... well, you know that... and on monday she's probably going to kill me...

speaker1: betsy thinks that was her at the gas station... 
speaker2: shut up, tom...
speaker3: no... heck... no... did you think she was following us?
speaker1: she's always thinking up stories like that... she never stops...
speaker2: well, if people don't tell you things...
speaker3: she's right, thomas... people should talk more.
speaker1: so you haven't been staying away because of us?
speaker3: what do you mean? is that what you thought? i was avoiding you two? no... you mustn't think that... that's terrible...
speaker3: the rain's off. let's go.

speaker1: i have to ask you something else. 
speaker2: go on.

speaker1: why did you leave just two days before my swimming test? 
speaker2: i didn't leave because it was two days before your test... it was just what your mother and i decided... i taught you how to swim... we went to the pool twice a week... why would i leave?
speaker1: i know... that's what i mean... why did you leave just then?
speaker2: oh, betsy. i'm sorry.
speaker1: it doesn't matter.
speaker2: how did you do, in the test?
speaker1: i passed.
speaker1: i'm a life-saver now.
speaker2: hey, thomas! we're going home... we're having a barbecue... betsy said she'll even let me eat a steak!
speaker1: hurry up, tom!

speaker1: don't call him tom, he doesn't like it. 
speaker2: i'm allowed.
speaker1: your mother said it, when we split up... don't lose the children... didn't mean much at the time. but she was right.
speaker2: who said i'd let you eat a steak?
speaker1: betsy. on monday will you come with me when i take the flowers back to anna? i can't face her alone. she wants to meet you anyway.
speaker2: sure.
speaker1: you'll be there, right beside me?
speaker2: i'd have to take the morning off school.
speaker1: is that bad?
speaker2: no, that could be good...
speaker1: just tell them you were with your invisible dad.

speaker1: what's she like? how did you meet her? 
speaker2: the funny thing is i fell in love with her before i ever saw her... i smelled her... it was the day i got out of jail... i was on the train and she was sitting behind me... it was just this incredible perfume... remember i'd been inside for nearly two years with four hundred sweating males... she got off the train and i followed her... i couldn't help it... that's how good she is... she listened to a who followed her off a train...
speaker2: ... but she's still going to kill me on monday...
speaker1: i think i'll paint the sunset tonight.
speaker2: it's just like a big pancake up there, isn't it?
speaker2: i remember when you two were tiny.. i used to watch you sleeping... it was like now... i felt close to you, could touch you... but you weren't there... you were gone... dreamland ... just when i was closest to you, you weren't there... i felt it last night, too.
speaker1: that's what it's like... you should know that.

speaker1: i'm not smart about things like that, usually. 
speaker2: don't be so tough on yourself. you seem to want to be... you don't have to...
speaker1: no?
speaker2: no... we can do that...
speaker1: is that a joke?
speaker2: no, i mean it... look out for yourself...
speaker1: who are you? who's inside there?
speaker2: you'll never know.

speaker1: well, it's been a while... you're bigger. 
speaker2: i suppose so. he's getting fat, too. i bet i could beat him at the breast-stroke now.

speaker1: come on in, kids... that boat doesn't look too safe... 
speaker2: we're fine!
speaker1: i've just found you... i don't want to lose you. what would i tell your mother... come on in...
speaker1: throw me the rope, thomas, i'll pull you in.
speaker1: this is one useless piece of rope, thomas...

speaker1: why does it always go so fast...? 
speaker2: i used to know how to do this...
speaker2: i did... i used to be really good at this...

speaker1: ah... smell it... the smell of civilization... scorched meat... 
speaker1: i'd forgotten that... how you eat... dedicated... like it's your religion!
speaker2: things i like.

speaker1: you used to hum to yourself too, when you ate... like everything was fine with the world. 
speaker2: hey, so i did... i'd forgotten about that...
speaker1: there she is... old mercury...
speaker2: no... mercury doesn't rise 'til after midnight... that's jupiter...
speaker1: i'd forgotten... we used to watch the stars... you could tell me the names of all the planets... you could recite them like a poem... remember... at the tiny window upstairs in the old house?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: oh well, not to worry. i'm glad you still like astronomy though.
speaker2: i'm not into star-gazing so much ... we're working on computer modelling... we're trying to make a biosphere...
speaker1: uh-huh?
speaker2: a self-sustaining life system... for inter-stellar travel. but we always get a methane build up, it doesn't matter what we do...

speaker1: this is at school? 
speaker2: yeah. we're making such a mess of the world, one day we're going to have to take off for somewhere else...
speaker1: sounds like donald said that...
speaker1: well, i'm glad you two are thinking about the old planet. i'm proud of you. look how beautiful everything is. sometimes i think it's people that make it all wrong... we walk around with all our problems...
speaker3: i don't know. if it wasn't for us there'd be nobody around to see it all.
speaker1: don't worry, you two... i'll tell you... it's just a big, black sheet up there with holes in it so the light comes through... that's the truth... the very latest...

speaker1: wait a minute... i know... the whole universe is inside a speck of dust that's lying in a ball of fluff in the cuff of a pair of pants hanging over the back of a chair... 
speaker2: no... i'll tell you... the whole thing... stars and everything... is sitting on the skin of a bubble of milk in a bowl of cornflakes... and somebody's just about to eat it...
speaker1: skimmed milk...
speaker3: you don't get bubbles in skimmed milk...
speaker2: okay... it's half-and-half...
speaker1: i've got a better one... we're all inside a speck of pollen that's stuck to the wing of a bee while it sits on a flower...
speaker2: don't mention flowers, betsy... please, not tonight.
speaker2: i have an idea, betsy... we're inside a pancake... what d'you think?

speaker1: why are you always talking about pancakes... what's wrong with you? 
speaker2: you've got pancakes on the brain.
