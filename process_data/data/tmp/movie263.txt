speaker1: what about them?
speaker3: according to the janitor, he... started mouthing off to one of the gunmen.
speaker1: oh, that was smart.
speaker3: i figure the other went for... ... that gun when the shooting started. one guy called a guard "slick."
speaker1: "slick?"
speaker3: yeah. and they ignored the loose cash.
speaker3: converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org 19.
speaker1: 'cause they had no time, cause they knew our response time, cause they were on our air.
speaker2: you recognize their m.o.?
speaker1: yeah. their m.o. is that they are good. once it escalated into a murder one beef for all of them after they killed the first two, they popped guard number three 'cause it didn't rake any difference anymore, so why leave a living witness? drop of a hat? they'll rock and roll. also: the way they went into the side indicates they are equipped to go in on the prowl. so also start looking for recent highline burgularies that have 'mystified' us. run the "slick" bit to the fbi and see what it kicks out.
speaker3: i called it in already.
speaker1: split the fences. i'll take cuzomano and torena. you take the east side. go through the tapes of who we been listening to. hang in with forensics on all physical evidence. how'd they know the route of the van and what it was carrying? does gage print the day's routes? what do they do with the printouts? who collects their trash? run makes on all their middlemanagement. did someone give this score up? check the three guards. see if one of them was a tipster.

speaker4: what's the vibe: home-grown or out-of-town?
speaker1: out-of-town. frankly, i hope they are scoring once and passing through. and i doubt it.
speaker2: this going to stay in area?
speaker1: this look like boosters working the local seven eleven to you? it goes to major crime. go to work.

speaker1: this is a partial split, but i took out of ours - every - to make up... ...his full end. because i want to settle him up and get rid of this jagoff right now. 
speaker2: okay.
speaker1: off.
speaker3: i had to dust him!
speaker1: electricity and chemicals a little up? you a shooter? speed? what?
speaker1: you didn't have to. now we got extra heat off a clean score.

speaker1: hold it. 
speaker2: turning, mildly surprised.
speaker3: waingro's disappeared.
speaker4: searches under cars, carefully. nothing.

speaker1: where's the rest? 
speaker2: that's it.
speaker1: eight thousand dollars? you gotta be kidding me!
speaker2: i squared the bookies and we had to pay off some guy and were short to start 'cause the rest is comin', in a coupla days. so don't sweat it. we're late.

speaker1: "me and neil." i'm married to you, now. this isn't the joint.
speaker2: don't mouth off to me!
speaker1: i want out of here!
speaker2: well there's the door! only leave dominick, the bank book and the car keys on the kitchen table!

speaker1: yes.
speaker3: well, you're right. you would be. but if you don't betray chris, you betray dominick. because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory 'cause you got no living parents to take him. then he ends up state-raised and for life. your son dominick's innocent. he didn't choose a life like that. chris did.

speaker3: vincent. it's me. we're set here. she'll make the call.
speaker1: i'm going to give you an address of where i'm staying. could you get it to chris?

speaker1: it's me. tracks back to this union guy, van zant. he had some beef with neil. neil already settled it. van zant got dead earlier tonight. now hugh benny has reformed his wayward life and become a born- again good citizen. so, he's revealed the key player is this cowboy waingro. used to be part of neil's crew. waingro committed a double murder today on towner, a driver, and his old lady. meanwhile waingro's checked into the airport hyatt house under "jamieson." maybe neil will make a move on him, but not likely. get the word to bailbondsmen, bookies, snitches in county, etc. where waingro is. and get a team down there to set it up.
