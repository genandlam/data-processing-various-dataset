speaker2: everybody there's going to be good, mom. i have to be better. my knees still knock when i do my free form. did you notice that?
speaker1: i noticed that it was fine.
speaker2: it's not supposed to be fine.

speaker1: and it just lays there, it doesn't do anything. i bet they notice that. that it doesn't do anything. that i don't do anything special enough to get in. 
speaker2: sara. you'll get in.
speaker1: don't lie because you love me. my free form
speaker2: i've got something for you. come on. sit. mouth closed, eyes shut. no pouting. no peeking.
speaker2: for luck tomorrow. not that you'll need it. you dance like an angel.

speaker2: mine either.

speaker1: wanna pray? you're leaving for philly after first period. i won't see you. we should pray. 
speaker2: lindsay... no. not here. lindsay grabs sara's hand and bows her head. sara, embarrassed, aligns her head with lindsay's. she's praying nobody sees them.

speaker2: ellison -- mr. ellison. he actually told me to break a leg.
speaker1: roses from the principal, even droopy, out-of-season yellow ones, is beyond cool, kiddo. you're definitely movin' up in the world.
speaker2: know what would be great? if you didn't drop me off at the bus station. if we just kept going until we get to philly.
speaker1: ruin everyone's valentine's day and not have a shop when i get back. that's your definition of great? i can see the headline now: 'starving artist kills unfit mother.' sweetheart, we talked about this. i'll get there as soon as i can.
speaker2: right. this is the hardest, most important day of my life and all you can do is get there as soon as you can. thanks, mom.

speaker1: so i guess i'll see you later. 
speaker2: i won't miss your audition, sara. i'll be there, okay? if i have to swim the susquehanna, i'll be there.
speaker1: swim? you can't swim, mom.
speaker2: i'll float then.
speaker2: hey... happy valentine's day.

speaker1: is there anything you'd like to share about your free form before you begin? a motif... a theme? 
speaker2: well, it's um, pretty self- explanatory. the theme.
speaker2: thank you.

speaker1: hi. 
speaker2: hi.
speaker1: have a good ride?
speaker2: slept through most of it.
speaker1: guess you got stuff. baggage.
speaker2: two suitcases. one big one.
speaker1: looks like they're unloading. -- you hungry? we can stop somewhere if you want.
speaker2: i'm kinda tired.

speaker1: i didn't like leavin' you so soon after the funeral. i wouldn't have if you hadn't asked me to go. i mean, i could've hung around. helped you say good-bye. that's what you were doin', wasn't it? 
speaker2: uh-huh.
speaker1: that's what i figured you were doin'.
speaker1: look. sara. i feel bad too. i mean, we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning. you don't have to pretend this is easy. everything's upside down right now but don't worry. we'll work this bachelor-father thing out. hell, it ain't like we're movin' in with strangers. we got a pretty good idea about each other, right?

speaker1: thought you were moving to fells point. 
speaker2: fell through.

speaker1: not much of what you're used to. but the water's hot and the fridge is full. and i made room in the closets for you. girl's gotta have closets, right? you even get your own bed. i'll crash on the couch. 
speaker2: you bought a bed?
speaker2: do you have a phone?
speaker1: of course i have a phone.
speaker2: you didn't at the last place. the last place i saw anyway.
speaker1: things change. you've changed.

speaker1: over the summer. you blew me off for some gig on the road, remember? can i call lindsay? let her know i got here alright. 
speaker2: are you alright, sara? i just wanna know how you feel.
speaker1: i feel fine. i feel like calling lindsay.
speaker2: phone's in the kitchen. knock yourself out.

speaker1: i can take the school bus. 
speaker2: school bus? that's the other oz, dorothy. patterson kids ride the city metro. or walk.

speaker1: well, i know how to do both. 
speaker2: not around here you don't. not until you get the hang of things.
speaker2: i called about your transcripts. you're all set. patterson's got a pretty good humanities program. no ballet, but we can find a studio someplace close for after school --
speaker1: -- i don't think i'll have time. i have to study, i'll be busy.
speaker2: good idea. take a break. not too long a break though. you're a dancer. you should dance. stay on top of your art.
speaker1: like you stay on top of yours?
speaker2: maybe i ain't playin' no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals, but i'm playing.
speaker1: i didn't mean it like that.
speaker2: s'alright. hell, i wish i had half the time i wasted gettin' wasted. but those days are over. you'll see. i got my life on track.

speaker1: you don't have to go in with me. since i'm all set. i mean, i have done this before. gone to school. i'll be fine. i am fine. really. 
speaker2: -- pick you up. three-thirty.
speaker1: yeah. sure. whatever.

speaker1: any questions? concerns? 
speaker2: about school? no. not really.
speaker1: not even about baltimore?
speaker2: i'm not gonna be here that long. besides, it's just a city, right?

speaker1: yo, man, check it, the muthafuckers wasn't playin', they was jackin'. ten rides in five days. for real. 
speaker2: fools got caught for real too. ten years in five days. stall that

speaker1: that's how easy it is to give to charity around here. don't put your on the floor. 
speaker2: thanks.

speaker1: in cold blood represents a turning point in our country's literature. take the cap off and tell me why that is, mr. ricard. 
speaker2: gay rights. that compote dude who wrote it? sweet tooth. straight- up fag, mr. j.
speaker1: thank you, mr. ricard. your genius grant is in the mail. anyone else?
speaker1: ms... johnson. you can catch up later. if this is over your head.
speaker3: it's a non-fiction novel. the first of its kind. capote mixed true events with things he couldn't know, so he made them up.
speaker4: white folks back then felt safe. capote scared 'em. he took hard core crime out the ghetto and dropped it in america's back yard. that's what makes the book special.

speaker1: yeah. that is part of it. 
speaker2: that's all of it. capote wasn't first. richard wright and james baldwin did the same thing. wasn't nobody tryin' to read them though.
speaker1: lots of people read them.
speaker2: lots of people like who? you?
speaker3: mr. j.! girl needs to bone up. give her a pass to the lib'ary.
speaker4: she can have your pass, mr. ricard. since you obviously never use it.

speaker1: ... i know you're new to the table, but think about it. we're the y2k generation and nobody takes us seriously. we don't take ourselves seriously. just look around. half the student body is d.o.a. -- and that's from the neck up, clara.

speaker2: it ain't anymore, nikki. not to me.
speaker3: rum and coke, straight up. and a beer. i don't care. anything.
speaker2: bad choice. 'anything.'
speaker3: it's just a beer.

speaker3: whatever.
speaker2: what's that mean? whatever.

speaker1: whatever you want it to mean. you're the whiz kid, right? you know everything. 
speaker2: not everything. like i don't know why we're standin' still. i'm supposed to be dizzy by now. remember? from all those circles you danced around me.
speaker1: i don't feel like dancing.
speaker2: but you do know how...?
speaker1: would i be here if i didn't?
speaker2: ... let's do it then. c'mon.
speaker2: now move your hips. not so fast. sara! just like our hands. 'flashlight! neon light! stop light! everybody got a little light under the sun.'

speaker1: she's all up in your nut, nikki... oh, that's right. it ain't your nut anymore. 
speaker2: it is if i want it to be. he is if i want him to be. that ain't got on me.

speaker1: man, what the are you doin'? 
speaker2: they the ones tryin' comin' here. squarin' off in my
speaker1: you couldn't let it slide?

speaker1: we those fools up for sure.
speaker2: for sure, man.

speaker1: ... yeah, i'ma tell you. tell you like i keep tellin' you, patrick. you need to let malakai alone. let him handle his own before he drags you down in it. 
speaker2: chenille. i heard you the first five hundred times.
speaker1: i'll see you monday. he'll walk you.
speaker3: it's just a few blocks. it's okay.
speaker1: no, it's not okay. would you tell the girl it ain't okay?
speaker2: it's not okay, okay? come on, braveheart.

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: what?

speaker1: why you keep lookin' at me? 
speaker2: i have to look somewhere. the streets are deserted. might as well look at you.
speaker1: that's not why. you wanna know somethin'. ask somethin'.
speaker2: it's not a question. it's the way you were beating that kid up. you looked so mad.
speaker1: i was mad and he wasn't no kid. but you're from the suburb mars, right? folks don't fight there.
speaker2: not like that. you were really kicking his ass.
speaker2: are you laughing at me?
speaker1: my friend was in trouble.
speaker2: maybe he's my question. your friend. chenille doesn't like him.
speaker1: she likes him. it don't stop her from trippin' off him now and then. but malakai's good people. we go back. way back. you know, like they say, through thick and thin. so, how'd you like feetz?

speaker1: it was great. 
speaker2: once you got used to the music.
speaker1: it wasn't the music i wasn't used to. i mean, it's not the first time i heard hip-hop, patrick.
speaker2: uh-huh. bet you listen to it all the time.
speaker1: not all the time. but a lot.
speaker2: we gettin' any closer to your crib or should we stop for food and water?
speaker1: we passed it.
speaker2: you passed it.
speaker1: thanks for walking me.
speaker2: no problem.
speaker1: so. i'll see ya.
speaker2: is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz, had a great time, can't wait to see you again?

speaker1: or is it like 'see ya,' i'll bust a cap in your if you ever darken my doorstep again? 
speaker2: i haven't said gee-whiz since i was six. but i really had a great time... okay?
speaker1: okay.

speaker1: figured i'd put a little marrow in your bones. siddown, siddown. you gettin' along at school? makin' friends...? ... see any of 'em last night? 
speaker1: i came home on my break.
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: ... oh? you're hard! look. you're seventeen. if you wanna go out, go out. but don't lie to me. on top of everything else, don't make me worry like that about you.

speaker1: i didn't mean to yell. so how are the eggs? they good? 
speaker2: you're right. i should've said something. i'm sorry.
speaker1: what're you gonna do today?
speaker2: nope. nothing special.

speaker1: ... how you know i can't do nothin' for you? i'm the hardest workin' man in showbizness, girl. c'mon. let me be the bomb in your shell. 
speaker2: you do the to yourself, man.
speaker1: that was black magic, patrick. it's gonna work one of these days.

speaker1: last one on the rack. i snatched it up for you. rang it up on my discount. 
speaker2: thank you, snookie.
speaker1: you workin' or what, man?
speaker2: on my way. soon as i get outta here...

speaker1: throwin' a party? 
speaker2: just adding to my collection. i heard some stuff i didn't have last night.
speaker1: well, you were fly anyway. last night. dancin', i mean.
speaker2: not as fly as you.
speaker1: nobody's as fly as me.

speaker1: not yet anyway. 
speaker2: maybe we could hook up later. after school or somethin'. work on some of your moves. if you want.
speaker1: okay. sure.
speaker2: by the way, hammer's pretty much played out.
speaker1: not to me.

speaker1: what happened? 
speaker2: we freed the slaves and didn't teach them no manners. you're sara, right? toni. i was gonna introduce myself before but you're always with that crowd. you know. chenille, her girls, that identity crisis diggy. sara looks at toni. getting it. getting her. the
speaker3: seniors, a reminder before you rise up and change the world. mrs. gwynn is holding all diplomas hostage in her office. her only demand is the pleasure of your company for career d-day. be there.

speaker1: i don't know what to say. i don't. 
speaker2: how 'bout it? or should i say her? it's a fuck-fest, roy.
speaker1: don't talk to me like that, sara. i thought you were goin' to your friend's house after school. obviously, you changed your mind.
speaker2: sorry you got caught.

speaker1: sorry i got... observed 
speaker2: don't be mad at him. it's my fault. i'm real sorry, honey.
speaker1: it's nobody's 'fault.' it's over. let it be over. we're all adults.
speaker2: i think he means you know about sex. that we have it and he likes it. isn't that what you mean, roy?
speaker3: really? how often do you have it?
speaker2: things been kind of slow since you got here. once upon a time we were real rabbits, weren't we, roy?
speaker1: rhonda. shut up. please.

speaker1: medicine man. you know tute. tute takes in patrick. looks around. snickers derisively. 
speaker2: you call this a job, man?
speaker3: actually, i call it a car wash. the work i do, yeah, that's a job.
speaker2: i need some sticks. watch my ride, malakai.
speaker3: you hangin' with him now? think that's a good idea, 'kai?
speaker1: you got a better one?
speaker3: you could try layin' all this off for awhile. give yourself a chance on the other side.
speaker1: what other side?
speaker3: you know what i mean. it ain't like you don't have good sense.

speaker1: i got sense enough to know who i am, what i can do and where i can do it. i ain't like you. people don't just up and hand me 
speaker2: we ain't here for our health. you workin', then work. and don't forget the rims.

speaker1: maybe you think it's enough to have the grades, get a full scholarship. but it isn't, patrick. georgetown makes mulch of students like you every semester. you have to be ready to change. change friends. lifestyle. your entire point of view. what i'm saying is, options won't matter if you don't keep a clean nose to the grindstone. 
speaker2: i know that, mrs. gwynn.

speaker1: i get into u.m.b.c., financial aid, everything... 
speaker2: do i detect a 'but'? nikki folds her arms, regards her obdurately.
speaker2: i know you're -- how do you put it? -- large here, nikki. you enjoy that and it's fine for now. i guess. but you can't live your life like a popularity contest.
speaker3: i don't think it's realistic, what you're asking. things happen. things change. and the changes change you. what's the point of plans?
speaker2: to have a sense of direction.
speaker3: you can't direct destiny.

speaker1: i see here that you trained for juilliard, that you auditioned. 
speaker2: that was a long time ago.
speaker1: it was three months ago, sara. well, if you're not going to pursue dance, what are you going to do?
speaker2: i don't know. take a year off.
speaker1: be careful with later on, sara. it's a slippery slope. sometimes you can run right on top of it and it never catches up with you.

speaker1: feel the groove. don't let the music mess with you. 
speaker2: did you always want to be a doctor?
speaker1: who said i wanna be a doctor?
speaker2: chenille. everybody.

speaker1: keep it tight. watch your 
speaker2: what kind of doctor do you want to be?
speaker1: pediatrics. i like kids. come on, stay with me. you're slackin'.
speaker2: do you have any? kids.
speaker1: no. do you?
speaker2: i wasn't being smart, patrick.
speaker1: wouldn't be the first time.
speaker2: screw you. i'm brilliant.
speaker2: i didn't get it. that thing you just did. show me again?
speaker1: what was that you just did?
speaker2: a releve. over ice. with a twist.

speaker1: ballet. i used to dance, patrick. 
speaker2: you used to dance?
speaker1: uh-huh. used to as in don't any more. and don't ask me why.
speaker2: why not?
speaker1: because i don't want to talk about it.
speaker2: that's why you brought it up. did that whole relieve thing. 'cause you don't wanna talk about it?
speaker1: because it's not a big deal. can we just concentrate on this?
speaker2: yeah, we can concentrate. but i think it is a big deal. whatever it is you don't wanna talk about.

speaker1: sara, you're in the freaking ghetto. forget the riots. how are you supposed to meet anybody? 
speaker2: i have met somebody. sort of. i think. i mean, there's this guy...

speaker1: why's he do that? 
speaker2: he's a baby. they cry.
speaker1: he was screaming, chenille.
speaker2: he don't know you, kenny.
speaker1: i'm his father. he knows me. ... what should i do?
speaker2: come around more often.

speaker1: see? i can't talk to you. 
speaker2: and i can't depend on you! am i askin' you to do anything for him you ain't supposed to do?
speaker1: you don't ask, chenille. you make demands. you want money, you --
speaker2: -- i want you to pick up some of the slack. you always have an excuse.
speaker1: it's not like that. i get tied up.
speaker2: you wanna talk about tied up? try gettin' up in the middle of the night to change diapers and give him bottles or stayin' up with him when he's sick and havin' to drag your to school the next day.
speaker1: look. i'm doin' the best i can.
speaker2: it ain't good enough, kenny!

speaker1: i don't get paid 'til next week. 
speaker2: boo the hoo. you can't put my bizness up your nose on no layaway plan. c'mon now. you know what you gotta do.

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: you didn't see nothin', you don't say nothin'. not unless you want a taste for yourself. and that can be arranged.

speaker1: yeah i liked it. i was gonna go to juilliard. that school up my entire life. it's a long story. 
speaker2: let me guess. you don't wanna talk about it.

speaker1: i stole a bike here once. 
speaker2: why'd you do that?
speaker1: 'cause i didn't have one.
speaker2: that's a good reason.
speaker1: i used to do wild like that.
speaker2: you and malakai?
speaker1: yep. most of the time.
speaker2: i don't get you guys. you seem so... different.
speaker1: we're not.
speaker2: maybe you weren't then but you are now. you said you changed.
speaker1: doesn't make me different from him. not the way you think it does.

speaker1: i think malakai's scary. and i know you're not. 
speaker2: what you mean by scary? 'kai's tough. he has to be. he still got a good heart. i know.
speaker1: patrick.
speaker2: let me finish. me and him got into some awhile back. real bad we held up a gas station off 95. i bailed the ride -- jumped out the car. 'kai kept goin', got caught. i knew what he was gonna do that night. knew the car was hot. i woulda been guilty as him if they had caught me, if malakai had served my name up. but he didn't.
speaker1: that means you owe him something?
speaker2: he did his time plus most of mine.
speaker1: no matter how much he messes up?
speaker2: we all mess up. maybe malakai gave up. but he's still m'boy and he still got a chance. i ain't just gonna cross him completely off and be like everybody else.

speaker1: i stole a hat once. when i was twelve. my mom found it under my mattress, made me take it back. 
speaker2: gangsta' sara. stole a hat. call the f.b.i.
speaker1: you gonna turn me in?
speaker2: i think i'll wait for you to surrender. were you tight with your mom, sara? i mean, y'all get along and
speaker1: yeah...tight... got along and
speaker2: so she meant something to you.
speaker1: there's nothing to say.
speaker2: know why there's nothing to say? because you don't talk about her.
speaker1: i'm sorry she's dead. what do you want me to do? run through the streets screaming?
speaker2: why not? if it helps.
speaker1: well, it won't. so drop it.
speaker2: and you call malakai scary.

speaker1: i know you're not puttin' those dirty hands inside my refrigerator. 
speaker1: this what you're lookin' for?

speaker1: are you gonna tell me where we're going? why is the surprise for me? you're the one with something to celebrate. 
speaker2: we can celebrate together.

speaker1: i wanted to get you something and i couldn't figure out what. it's not much but i hope you like it. 
speaker2: i like it. i love it. thank you.
speaker1: wait. there's more.

speaker1: we have an audience. work with me. 
speaker2: work with you?
speaker1: grab something.

speaker1: surprise... sara? 
speaker2: i can't. i can't go in.
speaker1: you have to go in. this is where i'm bringing you. the ballet.
speaker2: i know, but --
speaker1: but what?

speaker1: i thought you would like it. 
speaker2: i did.
speaker1: you ain't actin' like you did.
speaker2: i'm sorry.
speaker2: i don't want you to think i didn't have a good time tonight, patrick. i did. but ballet isn't a part of my life anymore.
speaker1: why not? what happened? you just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent.
speaker2: how do you know i have talent? because i did some stupid leg trick.
speaker1: i saw the look on your face when you did it, sara. the same look i saw tonight. goofy happy. so if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real.
speaker2: maybe i don't want it to be real.

speaker1: what i want is to wake up and see my mom. for things to go back to the way they were. when they made sense. when my life made sense. and it's all my fault. she got scraped off the highway for me, for my audition. she was rushing. it was raining. it was raining... ... but she promised to be there. i made her promise. and then i didn't wait for her. i should have but they called my name and i didn't say anything. i just went out and danced. i was mad. i needed her and she wasn't there. 
speaker1: she was dying while i was dancing and i was mad at her and i'm sorry. i'm sorry...
speaker2: it's not your fault it rained or she died. or that you danced. that's what you were there for. your mom would've expected you to do what you did.
speaker1: that's what makes it so bad. she always did what was right for me. i wanted to be a prima ballerina -- had to be. even if it took most of our money, all of her spare time. i didn't care. it was my stupid dream and it killed her. all she wanted was for it to come true.

speaker1: you still got whatever you had when your mom was alive, sara. she wouldn't want you to give up. 
speaker2: i know... but she... i just don't think i can do it without her.
speaker1: do you want to do it, sara? i mean you. do you want juilliard?
speaker2: yeah. i do.
speaker1: then it's on you to make the dream come true.
speaker2: yeah. for my mom.
speaker1: for her. for you.

speaker1: lemme see that move you did. that cute leg relieve thing. come on, sara. 
speaker2: it hurts! i'm out of shape and it hurts. okay? satisfied?
speaker1: that's what you call outta shape, what's it take to get you in shape?
speaker2: practice.
speaker1: this is the perfect spot for that. you can run around and i can sit under the trees and watch you.
speaker2: i don't get in shape like that. but it's still a good spot. i got my application for juilliard. just in time too. they're holding auditions in baltimore next month.
speaker1: that's great!
speaker2: i'll never be ready in a month.
speaker1: sara, you puttin' the mojo on yourself.

speaker1: mojo? 
speaker2: negative white folks call it karma. the bad kind.
speaker1: you don't understand. ballet takes a lot of time, a lot of preparation. i used to practice two, three hours every day. i'm so far behind...
speaker2: quit whinin' and catch up then.
speaker1: it's not as easy as that. my free form still it's still the weakest part of my routine. that hasn't changed.
speaker2: so i'll help you with it.
speaker1: you will?
speaker2: yeah. i'll help you. tell me what you need to do and let's get busy.

speaker1: master p with the 'ghetto d'. showmesomethin', showmesomethin', give up that cruel. eyes on you! 
speaker2: nobody's watchin' you but me.
speaker3: go, patrick! go, patrick!

speaker1: sara...? 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: i'm sorry.

speaker1: he's in d.c. blues alley. he'll be gone all night. 
speaker1: roy's demo. the only one he ever cut. kinda grows on you.
speaker1: wanna see my room?
speaker1: sorry...

speaker1: excuse me? 
speaker2: 'hit it and quit it,' that's their motto.
speaker1: whose motto?
speaker2: black guys. everybody knows that.
speaker1: don't forget, they all have big and beat their wives.

speaker1: you smell, boy. 
speaker2: how can a piece of tell?
speaker3: you been scarce lately, man.
speaker1: somewhere dreamin' of a white christmas...
speaker4: ... and christmas ain't even for 'nother six months.
speaker5: lip. it's a so-to-speak thang, you ignorant

speaker1: so. so to speak? whassup. 
speaker2: back out my business, boy.
speaker3: you tappin' that white girl, man? that's why you ain't got time for your boyz no more, you too busy frontin'. too busy snowflakin'.
speaker2: how am i frontin', 'kai? i made time for this bullshit, didn't i?
speaker4: aww, man. you busted. that's why your jaws are gettin' so tight.
speaker1: you the one need his jaws tightened with your pork-ass instigatin' self.
speaker5: order somethin', patrick. this ain't no soup line.
speaker2: y'all hangin' tonight or what?
speaker3: we thinkin' about slidin' through that new rec center opened up on the eastside. you ridin'?
speaker2: eastside? that's the wrong side.

speaker1: i ain't messin' with those fools over there. you know how they are. 
speaker2: i ain't pressed. i got my own
speaker2: what you think? i'ma keep walkin' around waitin' for some chump to cap me? i'ma protect myself.
speaker1: that ain't protection. it's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem.
speaker2: ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout it. mayhem and madness.
speaker1: how you know? you ain't tried nothing else. now you sittin' up here strapped for no good reason. you askin' for trouble, malakai. you think this shit's funny?
speaker2: i think it's funny you think it ain't necessary. you act like you don't know where you are no more, patrick, and whassup out there for anybody who ain't you. maybe that's what happens when a white girl goes to your head.
speaker3: -- or gives you some.

speaker1: you, lip. i know what's out there. i also know you can get past it. but that ain't gonna happen, 'kai, long as you keep gettin' in your own way. 
speaker2: aw'ight. y'all said what you had to say. we back to bein' boyz.

speaker1: what's your favorite flower? 
speaker2: i don't have a favorite.
speaker1: yeah, but if you did...
speaker2: i dunno. maybe cymbidiums -- orchids. they're sort of show- boaty but they're pretty.
speaker1: what's your favorite color?
speaker2: agua.
speaker1: what's your second favorite color?
speaker2: mmm. mauve.
speaker1: you're makin' this real hard, sara. those ain't exactly tuxedo colors.

speaker1: nut. what are you talking about? 
speaker2: i was tryin' to get around to askin' you somethin' but since i'm some sorta nut, you probably wouldn't wanna go to prom with me...
speaker3: patrick -- it is patrick, isn't it? well, i think you were just leavin'.
speaker1: why does he have to leave? we're all adults. right?
speaker3: he either leaves or i throw his out. your call, sara.
speaker2: chill, man. i'm goin'. you don't have to come off with all 'at.
speaker3: who the are you to tell me how to come off? you're in my house alone with my daughter.

speaker1: i hate being your daughter. you ruin everything. 
speaker2: siddown. it's a free country, you can hate me. ain't like that's exactly news. but disrespectin' me, that's where the road ends, sara. i don't want him up here again. i mean it.
speaker1: you mean it because he's black.
speaker2: don't start that
speaker1: why's it because you hang with black guys and play jazz and have the hots for angela bassett?
speaker2: because he was in my house with his hands all over my daughter!
speaker1: keep telling yourself that. just don't expect me to believe it. i saw how you looked at him. but you didn't see him. well, for your information, he's a straight- a student with more heart and guts than you'll ever have!
speaker2: yeah? well, when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me, sara?

speaker1: want me to say it? you were a piece of husband and you're a piece of father! you were never there for mom or for me. you took off and never looked back. so don't talk to me about guts. 
speaker2: sounds like you have it all figured out.
speaker1: i have you figured out. you think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? you can't! i'm here because i have to be and it's a nightmare.
speaker2: well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is.
speaker1: how the would you know? you've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years!

speaker1: the 'love boat.' 
speaker2: love that is tap- dancin' on my last nerve.

speaker1: looks like she's tap-dancing on your last boyfriend. she got it like that? naw. never mind. 
speaker2: stall what? what you hear?
speaker1: some trash she's talkin'. about you.
speaker2: about me?
speaker1: yeah. how you ain't all 'at since patrick's takin' her to the prom. i am a little bit... chagrined though, nikki. you lettin' some white ho' show you up like that.
speaker2: you, malakai. her too.
speaker1: ain't no need in me... stuck up, i'm on your side

speaker1: yo. me and the boyz fixin' to shoot some hoops. us against druid hill. if you interested. 
speaker2: druid hill? yeah.
speaker1: gotta skip last period.

speaker1: it ain't over, 
speaker2: over? i don't even know why it started... and don't say it's about patrick because it's not. it's not about him.
speaker1: no. it's about you. white girls like you. creepin' up, takin' our men. the whole world ain't enough. you gotta conquer ours too.
speaker2: i like him, he likes me. and if you don't like that, screw you.
speaker3: girls. i think you need to talk.

speaker1: what the happened to you? 
speaker2: i got suspended. two days.
speaker1: for what? fighting? why were you fighting, sara?

speaker1: how's arvel? 
speaker2: pretty bad. can't even play a got-damned game of ball no more. chenille comes up behind him. squeezes, pats his shoulder.

speaker1: you see sara? she alright? you didn't hear? nikki jumped off at her in gym. it was fierce... 
speaker2: 
speaker3: it's alright. i'm okay.
speaker3: look. it's not a good time. i'll see you later... i'm okay.

speaker1: diondre, what your doin' here? 
speaker2: i can go where i want. you the one on punishment.

speaker1: there she go. gimme my two dollars. 
speaker2: whatever it is, i don't wanna hear it.
speaker3: i thought you had somethin' to say to me.
speaker2: you thought wrong.
speaker3: somethin' must be on your mind for you to get up in sara's face, start all this drama. what you tryin' to prove, nikki?
speaker2: you're the one tryin' to prove something. stuck up in her like she's somethin' special.
speaker3: what if she is? what's it to you? you didn't see me trippin' off that howard dude and i could have.
speaker2: that was different.
speaker3: how you gonna call it different?

speaker1: because she's white and he ain't. and don't sit there like you don't know what i'm talkin' about, patrick. 
speaker2: you don't even know what you're talkin' about, nikki.
speaker1: i don't? y'all black men, soon as you even think about goin' someplace good, first thing you do is find a white girl to take with you.
speaker3: uh-huh.
speaker2: i thought i was goin' someplace good with you. you the one called me off. but you ain't tryin' to remember that. now you mad. why? because she's white and i like her? i'm with her.
speaker1: please. you're with her because she's white. that's what sets me off.
speaker2: it ain't got no business settin' you off! me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. so keep your hands off her and that to yourself. nikki folds her arms across her chest, looks at him defiantly.
speaker1: i don't think it, i know it. but you go ahead, deny it. that's what y'all always do.

speaker1: what? i'm supposed to get excited because you decided to skate by and drop a dollar on the dresser? 
speaker2: it's more than a dollar. and it's all i got. i got laid off rom b.w.i., chenille. i been workin' part- time. money's tight. you know how you are about money. that's way i haven't been coming around.
speaker1: money ain't got nothin' to do with it, kenny. you don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around. you don't want the responsibility of comin' around. as long as you out there and i'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of. you ain't got no worries when it comes to him.
speaker2: and you don't have no feelings when it comes to me. all you do is and complain about what i don't do. i get sick of that.
speaker1: be sick of it. you ain't got to see me to see your son.
speaker2: i'll be sure to keep that in mind.

speaker1: want me to take him? 
speaker2: that wench. you gotta stand over her to make sure she puts your name on the list. triflin'
speaker1: i'll get 'em.
speaker2: so your old man flipped about the fight. probably thinks it's all patrick's fault.
speaker1: no. i explained about nikki.
speaker2: right. you put it all on her.

speaker1: she started it, chenille. she wanted to start it. i told you what she said. 
speaker2: maybe she didn't have no business gettin' in your face. but she had a reason to say what she said.
speaker1: so you agree with her? you think i don't belong with patrick.
speaker2: what i think don't matter. but you and him act like it don't bother people that you're together. like it don't hurt people to see.
speaker1: we like each other. what is the big deal? it's him and me. not us and other 'people.' the white girl with the rose-colored reasoning. chenille glares at sara, her voice designed to the blinders off.
speaker2: black people, sara. black women. patrick's about somethin'. he's smart. he's motivated. he's for real. he ain't gonna make no babies and not take care of 'em or run the streets, up his life. he's gonna do somethin' with himself. here you come, white and right, and you take one of the few decent men left after jail, drugs and drive-bys. that's what nikki meant about you up in our world.

speaker1: so what you gonna do? 
speaker2: how many times you gonna ask me that?
speaker1: it's payback time. either you down or you ain't. either you m'boy or you not. simple as that.
speaker2: even if i did ride, you ain't got nobody but lip and lip will get a nigger's killed. quick.
speaker1: eastside ain't got no firepower. i got some man. ak-47. we go in, get out with one spray down.
speaker3: you see us, patrick?

speaker1: you see us, man? we're rappin'. 
speaker2: me and sara lit it up! y-e-o-w!
speaker3: that ain't funny.
speaker2: right it ain't funny.
speaker1: i thought you liked it down there. that's your specialty, ain't it?
speaker2: that was a reflex action, man. and you just plain rude and wrong to bring the up in mixed company.
speaker4: i gotta get home. ready?
speaker1: no, he ain't ready. he's talkin'. to me. a-b conversation. gotta go? c yourself the home.
speaker4: you.

speaker1: have you lost your mind, man? huh? have you! 
speaker2: patrick, man, c'mon.
speaker3: you take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine?
speaker1: 'cause you wrong, malakai!
speaker3: no! you wrong. you been wrong. you ain't worth no more. get out my face, and take that ho with you.

speaker1: we should keep going. 
speaker2: you messed up.
speaker1: i know i messed up. i'll get it right the next time.
speaker2: no. you gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time.
speaker1: i can't work like this. i can't dance like this.
speaker2: like what?
speaker1: like this. you dictating to me.
speaker2: what's wrong, sara?
speaker1: nothing's wrong. i can't figure things out.
speaker2: what things? the audition? you ain't got nothin' to worry about.
speaker1: things, patrick. things between us. things between us and them.
speaker2: i didn't know there was a 'them.'
speaker1: well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the around.

speaker1: everything's screwed up. nobody wants to see us together, not even chenille. i don't know why they feel that way. how can i know? 
speaker2: they only got a point if you believe they got a point, sara.
speaker1: i'm just saying that we should think about this, that's all.
speaker2: that's a 'nough.
speaker1: why are you getting mad?
speaker2: because i like to think for myself, run my own life, and i thought you did too.
speaker1: you're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to malakai every time he up or you over.
speaker2: first of all, malakai ain't never me over. second of all, you don't know him, sara, what he been through. matter of fact, you don't know about none of it. so don't come off to me like you do.

speaker1: i know he's lost, patrick! everybody but you can see that. and if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost too. 
speaker2: who the are you to say he's lost? malakai had my back when you were busy gee-whizzin' in the woods with your backward-ass, redneck friends.
speaker1: they weren't rednecks!
speaker2: you know what? the with you.
speaker1: the with you too!

speaker1: lovers' quarrel? you're better off. that menace to society would've broken your heart and spent all your money in a news flash. trust me on that, sara. 
speaker2: toni, listen carefully. you're a simple and you don't have any friends, black or white, because nobody likes a

speaker1: i was wondering... how long you plan on hating me? maybe i'm an optimist but i hope there's some kind of timetable. well, i don't wanna bug you. i just came in to say good luck. 
speaker1: i saw the return address. got curious. it was open. i read it. i know i shouldn't have but at least now i have an excuse to tell you how proud i am of you, sara.
speaker2: i was gonna tell you about the audition, roy. i meant to.
speaker1: tomorrow's the big day?
speaker2: uh-huh. the big day.
speaker1: you bummed out about it? you're a worse liar than i am father.

speaker1: you're not so bad. i didn't give you much to work with. it's not like i've been the perfect daughter. 
speaker2: well, it ain't like i deserve a perfect daughter. i screwed up. did everything in a hurry and still thought i had all the time in the world. to be in love with your mother. be a father to you. but time flies. you look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went by.
speaker1: i don't hate you. i miss her. i miss mom... ... patrick's at me. i'm at him. he's not coming tomorrow and i want him there and i don't know what to do.
speaker2: you want him there. i understand that. but whatever he brings to the table, patrick can't dance for you, sara. you're the bottom line out there. this is your chance to be the dancer juilliard came to see.
speaker1: i wanted somebody there who loves me.

speaker1: why his mom's cryin' like that? arvel's gonna make it, right? that what's his nurse said. she told me herself, 'your friend's gonna make it.' did that lie to me! talk to me, patrick! is he gone? 
speaker2: they just got bad news, man. they don't need to hear it again. arvel's fightin'. he's gonna pull through. thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... arvel ain't gonna walk again.
speaker1: i got a good reason now, man?

speaker1: aw'ight, college boy. you do what you think is the right thing. i'ma do what i know is the only thing. 
speaker2: malakai... ... when it's on, i'll be there.

speaker1: why you so quiet? patrick reynolds ain't got nothin' to say? that's a first. you know how i go off on folks sometimes. i mean it and then i don't mean it. like what i said to sara. guess she told you. 
speaker2: i don't care what you said, chenille.
speaker1: patrick. your is on your back and your lips are on the ground. you care, baby brother. and not just about what i said. you seriously like sara. she got a serious jones for you. am i lyin'?

speaker1: it's besides the point. whatever point it is you tryin' to make. 
speaker2: i'm sayin' you can't help who you love, patrick. at least you found somebody who loves you back.
speaker1: i gotta go.
speaker2: to where? to who? malakai? you ain't through with that fool yet.
speaker1: he's not a fool, chenille.
speaker2: no. you know what? you're the fool, patrick. you think you let malakai down and all you did was try to pull yourself up. ain't no blame or shame in that.
speaker1: i still gotta go. check you later.

speaker1: i shouldn't have... i was trippin'. 
speaker2: you always trip. i'm used to that. besides, you were right. you were wrong, too. so was i. i need to do better. ain't no doubt about that.
speaker1: i know i come down on you hard about money, but i would rather you spend the time. seriously.
speaker2: so you don't want any money?
speaker1: i didn't say all that.
speaker2: i love my son, chenille. you know that, don't you?
speaker1: yeah. i always knew that.

speaker1: pull over. this ain't helpin' nobody, 'kai. i'm out. i mean it. stop the car. 
speaker2: awww, here we go.

speaker1: what you gonna do, 'kai? you gonna shoot me? go ahead! you'll have to! 
speaker2: let him out! we don't need him.
speaker3: shut the up.

speaker1: perking up, taking notes, attentive to her. 
speaker2: finishes with a flawless arabesque. looks out.

speaker1: you prepared a free-form? 
speaker2: yes... sir... they have... my music.
speaker3: does it have a theme?
speaker2: yes. emo... emotion.
speaker1: cue johnson's music.

speaker1: are you ready now? 
speaker2: yes, sir. she's ready.
speaker2: you can do it. ain't nobody watchin' you but me. sara's eyes focus on him. she nods. turns to the judges.
speaker3: i'm ready.

speaker1: ladies and gentlemen, please! young man! get off the stage. wider to reveal the room. 
speaker2: all due respect, if ya'll don't let this girl in, you're crazy!
speaker3: thank you. very much.
speaker1: ms. johnson!
speaker1: i can't say this on the record -- yet. but welcome to juilliard.
