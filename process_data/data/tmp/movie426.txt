speaker1: go on now paul, don't be long. 
speaker1: paul... paul?
speaker1: paul?! the glow fades again.

speaker1: beautiful piece. 
speaker2: straight. practical performance. 100% japanese, folded steel. real hero
speaker1: how much?

speaker1: clive nods, puts the sword down and walks away. 
speaker2: aren't you gonna get it?
speaker3: no, it's rubbish.

speaker1: what are you going to ask? 
speaker2: do you feel that the killing of hicks and newt in alien 3, invalidates ripley's struggle at the closed of the previous installment?
speaker1: i was going to ask that!
speaker2: tough four eyes.
speaker3: alright, next!
speaker4: hey there. who's it to?
speaker1: graham.

speaker1: graham. 
speaker2: uh... are you... did you?
speaker1: there you go.
speaker1: hey there. who's it to?
speaker3: clive.
speaker1: clive.
speaker3: uh... are you... did you?
speaker1: there you go.
speaker3: i... i need to photograph him.
speaker4: you can take it from there.

speaker1: that was amazing. i was actually a bit nervous. 
speaker2: really? i wasn't.
speaker1: good egg, wasn't he?
speaker2: yes, very unaffected. damn, i forgot to give him my card.

speaker1: give it to colossus. 
speaker2: nah. hey, rosario dawson's here!
speaker1: she needs to call me.

speaker1: looks good, right? 
speaker2: yes, it's very impressive.
speaker1: it really does the image justice. i never noticed the third tit.
speaker2: that was graham's idea.
speaker1: ladies man, huh? you guys happy? you got enough pens? you wanna snapple? you wanna a diet coke?
speaker2: i'll have a fat coke please?
speaker1: a fat what?
speaker2: coke.
speaker1: oh you man a fat coke.
speaker2: a what?
speaker1: fat coke.
speaker2: yes please.

speaker1: when do we start? 
speaker2: ten minutes ago.
speaker3: why is it so quiet?
speaker2: sylar's doing a q and a in the main pavillion.
speaker3: oh man! i wanted to go to that . i wanted to find out if he actually eats the brains.
speaker2: i can make a call.
speaker3: please.
speaker2: it'll pick up when he's done.
speaker1: i'm nervous.
speaker3: don't be. the hard work's done, we have a great story and as usual your renderings jump from the page.
speaker2: yeah man. three awesome.
speaker1: thank you.
speaker3: all we have to do now is sit back and enjoy.
speaker3: queen jelva welcomes thee.
speaker4: do you know where sylar's on?
speaker3: main pavillion.
speaker4: thanks. hey, three awesome.

speaker1: okay, that's the hour. how'd we do? 
speaker2: three copies.
speaker1: hey, one for each tit. maybe you should have given her four.
speaker3: that's sick.
speaker1: don't sweat it. it's a sleeper.
speaker2: yeah, but three copies?
speaker1: better than carl weathers.

speaker1: would you like a copy? 
speaker2: are you nuts? my office is full of junk.
speaker3: graham, i need a drink.

speaker1: it was like the prancing pony in there. 
speaker2: nasty hobbitses.
speaker1: they think they're so cool.
speaker2: hey, are you excited about going to area 51?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: 06.30 check out?
speaker1: a-ffirmative. graham and clive both look at their watches.
speaker1: three, two, one...
speaker3: beep. beep.
speaker1: good night, graham.
speaker2: good night, clive.
speaker2: are you asleep?
speaker1: no.

speaker1: shall we try and storm the citadel before we nod off? 
speaker2: couldn't hurt could it?
speaker2: cover me.

speaker1: there you go. 
speaker2: that's not ours.
speaker1: no?
speaker3: no, that's ours.
speaker1: oh.
speaker1: borg. assimilate this!

speaker1: breakfast? 
speaker2: java. straight up.
speaker1: any solids?
speaker2: no, let's punch through. miles make the eggs taste sweeter.
speaker1: i love eggs!
speaker2: i hear that. now, get that "â˜joe' on the go and jump in the chewie seat.
speaker1: good job i pre-pared.
speaker1: it's a shame i don't have some controls on this side. that way, i could take over if you needed the loo.
speaker2: yeah, i could say "take the helm."â
speaker1: "take the helm, number one."â
speaker2: yeah, "take the helm, number one, i need a number two."â
speaker1: "â˜least i've got cerebro, eh?

speaker1: absolutely. real-time sat-nav multi map and advanced geo-tagging with continual info stream? 
speaker2: impressive.
speaker1: most impressive.
speaker2: and let's not forget, we've always got analogue.
speaker1: not when we're driving graham.
speaker2: sorry.
speaker2: sounds like coffee o'clock.
speaker1: thank i'm a wreck until i've had my first cup of j.

speaker1: looks like a pile of dead droids. 
speaker2: you boys all set? can i get you anything else?
speaker3: they drive in silence, surveying the landscape.

speaker1: amazing, isn't it? there are 295,734,134 people in this country and we haven't seen a soul for a hundred miles. where is everybody? 
speaker2: what about that old woman on crutches we saw hitchhiking?
speaker1: apart from her. i suppose that's why they established the dreamland facility out here.
speaker2: far from prying eyes.
speaker1: did you know the site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the u-2 spyplane, due to its remoteness, proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bad for landings?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: oh.
speaker2: shall we have a bite before or after we hit the black mailbox?
speaker1: before.

speaker1: "watch the skies"â or "alien onboard?"â 
speaker2: "alien onboard."â

speaker1: nice choice. so, where have you boys come from? 
speaker2: san diego.
speaker1: comic-con?
speaker3: how could you tell?
speaker1: just a guess. my nephew launched a comic down there a couple of years ago. sort of dramatized the accounts of some of the folk we've had in here.
speaker3: encounter briefs?
speaker1: that's it. you heard of it, huh?
speaker3: i've got all six.
speaker1: well whaddya know? small world.
speaker3: do you get a lot of ufo types round here?
speaker1: some.
speaker2: have you ever seen one?
speaker1: a ufo? oh, i've seen plenty.
speaker2: really?! you've seen more than one ufos?

speaker1: well, i don't know what they were. so as far as i'm concerned they're unidentified and they were definitely flying. 
speaker2: and objects.
speaker1: straight. whether or not they were spaceships, i can't say. probably not, but i'd like to think they were. be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe.
speaker2: did you now, it's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts, around which orbit countless planets and moons?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: makes you think though, don't it?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: where is everybody?
speaker1: you boys all set?
speaker2: i'd like a cup of coffee please.
speaker1: sure thing. how about you, sugar?
speaker3: can i have an e.t. malt please?
speaker1: you wanna sparkler in that?

speaker1: i'll take that as a yes. 
speaker2: it's nice here, isn't it?
speaker3: absolutely.
speaker2: i think i might use the loo.
speaker1: yes dear, what can i get you?
speaker4: two beers.
speaker1: coming right up.

speaker1: hey graham, an alien just sicked up into my palms. 
speaker1: i'm joking, of course. they have a soap dispenser, shaped like an alien's head. when you pump his jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.
speaker2: clive...

speaker1: it's hilarious. 
speaker1: what?
speaker2: here it comes!
speaker2: okay then, beers for you gentleman. a cup of joe and a extra thick malt with a sparkler for the boys from outer space.
speaker2: so, where you boys headed?
speaker3: we're heading into utah. do ourselves some hunting.
speaker4: deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps in front of the bangstick, right jake?
speaker3: you got that right, gus.
speaker2: well now, i heard utah beaver puts up quite a fight.
speaker4: that's what we're counting on.
speaker2: i better make you something good and hot. long way to the beehive.

speaker1: what took you so long? 
speaker2: i was putting the sticker on.
speaker1: they were an odd pair, weren't they?
speaker2: definitely didn't speak bocci.
speaker2: that wasn't their truck was it?
speaker1: no.

speaker1: what's the matter? 
speaker2: nothing. how we doing?
speaker1: we should be just about there.
speaker2: i've found it.
speaker1: where?

speaker1: the black mailbox. 
speaker2: it's amazing, isn't it? we're actually here.
speaker3: area 51.
speaker2: dreamland.
speaker3: the groom lake military test facility.
speaker2: macarthur's black mile.
speaker3: is that a real one?
speaker2: no, i made it up myself.
speaker3: i like it.
speaker2: be great if we saw something.
speaker3: yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft.
speaker2: that would be incredible. it just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast.

speaker1: what would you do if they actually landed? 
speaker2: keep it together. first contact is a big responsibility. they come in peace, we go to pieces? that's not how i roll.
speaker2: what's wrong?
speaker1: it's them. they found us. i don't know how but they found us.
speaker2: who? who's found us?
speaker1: the libyans!
speaker2: run for it marty!

speaker1: perhaps it's not them. perhaps whoever it was turned doff. 
speaker2: of course it's them. we're dead. it's like deliverance. they're going to us and break our arms.
speaker1: i don't want my arms broken!
speaker2: there's only one thing for it.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i'm gonna have to fly blind.

speaker1: probably best not to do that. i couldn't really see anything. 
speaker1: oh oh oh
speaker2: i need the toilet.
speaker1: me too.
speaker1: they're trying to overtake.
speaker2: don't let them get past.
speaker1: should i ram them?
speaker2: what about the deposit?
speaker1: it wasn't them.
speaker1: we should see if they're okay.
speaker2: i still need a wee.
speaker1: i can hold mine.

speaker1: hello? 
speaker2: maybe you should call for help.
speaker3: i wouldn't do that if i were you.
speaker1: i rather think these men need help. graham, give me the phone.
speaker3: seriously, i wouldn't do that.
speaker4: 911 emergency. how may i direct your call? hello? hello?

speaker1: put - the phone - down. 
speaker2: what have you done to him?

speaker1: i didn't do anything. he fainted. 
speaker2: yes but you made him faint.
speaker1: i did not. okay i did, but it's not like i set my phaser to "â˜faint'.
speaker2: you've got a phaser!?
speaker1: no! look, i need you to help. can you get this guy back onto your wagon?
speaker2: are you going to probe us?
speaker1: no! where does that come from? why do people always assume we want to stick something up their ass?
speaker2: don't you?
speaker1: no. there's certainly nothing about it in the encounter manual. as a rule, we don't even abduct. maybe people find it easier to deal with earthly transgressions if they suppress it with absurd fantasies about alien probing.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: it's just a theory. listen, focus okay? i promise you i won't hurt you, i just need your help.
speaker2: you need my help?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: how come i can understand you? are you using some sort of neural language router?

speaker1: no, i'm speaking english you prick. sorry, i'm tense. look, what's your name? 
speaker2: graham willy.
speaker1: what about him?
speaker2: that's the writer, clive gollings.
speaker1: well, let's get clive into the rv and get going. i'll explain everything on the way. please.
speaker2: where are we going?
speaker1: north.
speaker2: the rv's gotta be back in 2 days.
speaker1: well, then we're gonna have to hustle, aren't we?

speaker1: look graham, you're just gonna have to trust me, okay? 
speaker1: please man, i need you.
speaker2: okay then.
speaker1: great. thank you.
speaker2: what's your name?

speaker1: i'm paul. 
speaker2: paul?
speaker3: yeah. now let's get cloverfield onto the recreational vehicle and get the off macarthur's black mile.
speaker3: oh man, has he...?
speaker2: i told him he should have gone.
speaker3: could have been worse. know what i'm saying?

speaker1: can i have this ham? 
speaker2: uh... yes.
speaker1: great!
speaker2: paul? where am i going again?
speaker1: i told you, north. do you have a map?
speaker1: not when we're driving, graham.
speaker3: the map disappears back up into the roller.
speaker2: sorry.
speaker1: just head north. we need to get as much distance as we can between us and them.
speaker2: them? who's them?

speaker1: sir? 
speaker2: talk to me.
speaker1: three survivors, company men, hurt but alive.
speaker2: anyone else?
speaker1: no sir.
speaker1: what's this?
speaker1: what is it sir? brake fluid? gas?
speaker2: no. it's neither of those things.

speaker1: what's the situation? 
speaker2: we have a guest who's left the hotel without paying, sir.
speaker1: it! do you think he's "â˜left' left?
speaker2: doubtful. norad would have picked up a bogie. those guys can track santa. no sir, he's still here.
speaker1: don't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence?
speaker2: how so?
speaker1: i signed the red document this morning, zoil. don't you think it's odd that he chooses today to go awol? how did he know?
speaker2: are you suggesting he has someone on the inside.
speaker1: maybe.
speaker2: well he's definitely got someone on the outside.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: tire tracks, sir. tire tracks... among other things. i'd bet my left nut that little bastard's hitched a ride.
speaker1: lock down the area. road blocks, spot checks, the whole nine yards. you're going to handle this personally, zoil. i want this wrapped up before letterman.

speaker1: the bulb's gone in there. 
speaker1: i hate it when you get the closed ones, right?
speaker2: i usually bite them open.
speaker1: are you insane? you gotta tap "â˜em and if they don't open you throw them away.
speaker2: that's molluscs.
speaker1: shut up.
speaker2: it's true.
speaker2: hello clive! how are you feeling?
speaker3: i'm feeling like i've gone mental mad, graham. if that is your name? you're happily sitting there chatting to... to... that, like it's the most natural thing in the world. the two of you laughing away like you haven't seen each other since 1990.

speaker1: so forgive me if i seem a little rattled but from where i'm standing it would appear you are trading nut knowledge with an alien life form. 
speaker2: his name is paul.
speaker1: oh, paul is it? paul what? paul verhoven? paul freeman? paul reiser?
speaker3: just paul. you know, like madonna or dracula.
speaker2: paul's from a small planet in the northern spiral arm of the andromeda galaxy.
speaker1: no he is not!
speaker3: i am man, seriously.
speaker1: how could he possibly have travelled that distance?
speaker3: wormhole.
speaker1: balls! graham, this isn't what it seems. what about ocham's razor?
speaker2: the hairdressers?
speaker1: yes, the old man who owns it told me that, in unbelievable circumstances, the most plausible explanation is usually the truth.
speaker3: and what's the most plausible explanation, clive?
speaker1: that you're a thin midget in an alien costume.

speaker1: there's no such thing as a thin midget? those guys are built. have you not seen the station agent? 
speaker2: he's right. i think that's less believable than paul being form a planet in the norther spiral arm of the andromeda galaxy.
speaker3: oh really?
speaker1: ow! get off me!
speaker3: you're not real. you're not real!
speaker2: excuse me.
speaker1: get off me, you psycho!

speaker1: oh 
speaker1: where's he gone?
speaker2: maybe he beamed up.
speaker1: as if. we would have seen the classic shimmer and hum.
speaker2: good point.

speaker1: where you boys from? australia? 
speaker2: britain.
speaker1: ah. g'day mate.
speaker1: whatcha doin' in the us fellas?
speaker3: comic-con.
speaker1: you're a long way from san diego.
speaker2: we were having a little drive.
speaker1: is that right?
speaker4: hey haggard?!
speaker5: yeah?
speaker6: these guys have met michael biehn.
speaker5: no how was he?
speaker2: he was a good egg.
speaker7: very unaffected.
speaker5: that's nice to hear.
speaker5: o'reilly? anything else?

speaker1: just some pissy jeans. 
speaker2: okay, you guys can go.
speaker3: thank you. may i ask what you're searching for?
speaker2: of course you may.

speaker1: well, it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it? 
speaker2: is it?
speaker1: yes, the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the black mailbox, which was white by the way, and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien. i mean, it's what we've always wanted, isn't it?
speaker2: i suppose so.
speaker1: than that's what happened. paul materializes from thin air behind them.

speaker1: where the did you go? 
speaker2: nowhere.
speaker3: what, you went invisible?
speaker2: it's not invisibility per so. it's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure.
speaker3: like predator?
speaker2: exactly.
speaker3: can you do it whenever you want?
speaker2: anytime...

speaker1: no thank you. 
speaker2: you sure? how about a cup of coffee? come on hulk, i'll get you a nice cuppa j.
speaker2: hey, look who's up!

speaker1: hello paul. 
speaker1: what's the matter?
speaker2: graham, there is a grey in the galley, making me coffee.
speaker1: did you want tea?
speaker2: no, i don't want tea.
speaker1: tea's a bit weird in america, isn't it?
speaker2: no, what's wried, graham, is that we have picked up an extra terrestrial hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it!
speaker1: he needs our help, clive.
speaker3: you got it? yes i've got it.
speaker3: it's hot. thank you.
speaker4: look clive, i'm gonna go out on a limb and say this is probably the weirdest thing that's ever happened to you. am i right?
speaker4: and i appreciate the fact that i have somewhat gate-crashed the party here but, truth be told, i'm in a of a pickle. i really need your help.

speaker1: why us? 
speaker2: why not?
speaker1: what about the rv? it has to be back in two days.
speaker3: clive, he's an alien. a living, breathing, alien.
speaker1: i suppose we could phone the hire company and get an extension.
speaker1: how did you get here?
speaker2: crashed in "â˜47. anti-grav failure.
speaker3: happens to the best of us.
speaker2: also, i'm a driver.
speaker1: oh my roswell?! that was you?!
speaker2: roswell was a smoke-screen man, designed to distract from the truth.
speaker1: they invented a fake alien crash to distract from an actual alien crash?
speaker2: i know, stupid, isn't it?
speaker1: what have you been doing here all this time?

speaker1: oh you know, kickin' back, shooting the advising the government. 
speaker2: not just the government.

speaker1: ...i want him to have some kind of special power, you know? something sort of messianic... 
speaker2: how about molecular revivification.
speaker1: i don't know what that is.
speaker2: restoration of damaged tissue through telepathic manipulation of cellular intrinsic field memory.
speaker1: i...uh...
speaker2: healing, steven.
speaker1: oh right yeah. like by touch sort of thing? his little finger could light up at the end and-
speaker2: you know what? sometimes, less is more.
speaker1: you got another call?
speaker2: yeah i gotta take this man. it's the v guys again.

speaker1: right. 
speaker2: you'd be surprised how much he's influenced popular culture generally over the last 60 years.
speaker3: how come you know so much?
speaker2: we had quite a long chat while you were unconscious.
speaker2: ...while you were asleep.
speaker1: you want a bagel clive?
speaker3: no thanks.
speaker1: graham?
speaker2: yes please.
speaker3: go on then, i'll have half.
speaker1: you want anything on it?
speaker3: jam.
speaker1: what?
speaker3: jelly.
speaker1: gotcha.
speaker2: i gave your jeans a swill and hung them up.

speaker1: thank you. so, do you know where we're going? 
speaker2: just north. he said we had to make a right at utah.
speaker1: why can't he tell us?
speaker2: he said it was a surprise.
speaker1: do you trust him, graham? i mean, is he strider or black rider?
speaker2: strider, definitely.
speaker1: you'd better be right. i don't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus.
speaker2: it's okay, he doesn't do that.
speaker3: bagel time!
speaker2: fuel level's critical.
speaker3: sorry, i had a warning light just like that on my ship.
speaker2: for fuel?
speaker3: anti-grav failure.
speaker1: there's a place called ely five miles from here. it's small but there should be a gas station.
speaker2: roger that, number one.

speaker1: paul, don't do that! 
speaker2: here's what i need. some organic beef mince, organic pork, some veal, red onions, pine nuts, pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a fistful of fresh basil and 3 war ciabattas.
speaker1: you know this is a gas station?

speaker1: ready? 
speaker2: ready.
speaker3: get me some more peanut mandms.
speaker4: after you.
speaker1: thanks.

speaker1: coming... ready or not! 
speaker2: orange?
speaker1: no thanks.
speaker2: nice and juicy.
speaker1: i don't want to spoil breakfast.
speaker2: do you mind telling me what's going on, agent?
speaker1: just keeping ourselves occupied sir. things are pretty slow.
speaker2: where's the other one?
speaker1: i don't know, let's see. haggard?
speaker3: sorry, i was just... hiding.
speaker2: i see. you fellas had much traffic through here?
speaker3: just a big rv driven by a couple of nerds.
speaker2: nerds, huh?
speaker3: yeah, they'd been to comic-con and met michael biehn.

speaker1: i've heard he's nice. 
speaker2: good egg.
speaker3: very unaffected.
speaker1: did you search the vehicle thoroughly?
speaker3: yes sir.
speaker1: find anything?
speaker3: not really. just michael biehn's autograph and some pissy jeans.
speaker1: did you get the license plate?
speaker1: make?
speaker2: it was big.
speaker1: i want everything you can remember. descriptions of the occupants, height, hair, distinguishing features. we can do it on the way.
speaker2: on the way?
speaker1: you're coming with me.
speaker3: what about the road block sir?
speaker1: it didn't work.

speaker1: don't you think that's a bit much? put it all back. except the burrito... and the doughnuts... and the chocolate milk. let's just pay for it and leave. 
speaker2: we need bulb for the toilet.
speaker1: essential only, graham!
speaker3: morning chris!
speaker4: hey dean.
speaker3: who do you think i had in my office this morning?
speaker4: jeremy piven?
speaker3: no. the secret service.
speaker4: they find out how you can afford a dodge viper on troopers pay?
speaker3: not yet. they're all over this crash on the road up to rachel.
speaker4: what you think's going on?
speaker3: don't know, could be muslims.
speaker4: cheeerist!

speaker1: you go right ahead. 
speaker2: thank you very much, officer.
speaker1: where're you guys from?
speaker3: britain.
speaker1: britain, huh? nice place. no guns!
speaker4: no guns? cheeerist.

speaker1: it's find for you. you'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to guantanamo bay. 
speaker1: why's everything so funny? they think we're muslims.

speaker1: that's their excuse for everything. there are worse things you can be. we had a muslim guy at the base. systems analyst called yusef. we used to do karaoke on tuesday nights. you should'a heard him do matthew and son. shame i didn't get a chance to say salam alaikum. 
speaker2: paul, the authorities know we're in an tv.
speaker1: we're hardly the only rv on the road. trust me, if we stay off the highways, keep to the back routes, we'll have a nice uneventful journey.

speaker1: that made me jump. 
speaker2: ah yes, the waspish markings of a scott's oriole. unmistakable.
speaker1: what a waste.
speaker3: poor thing.
speaker2: nothing anyone could've done.
speaker3: what are you doing?
speaker3: it's a miracle!

speaker1: i'll miss these. 
speaker2: why would you do that?
speaker1: i'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am

speaker1: by the time i got the bulletin, they were long gone. seemed like nice fellas to me. 
speaker2: is it true they was muslims?
speaker1: they said they were british.
speaker3: i think you can be both.
speaker2: cheeeeerist!
speaker4: agent zoil?
speaker3: excuse me gentlemen.
speaker5: report.
speaker3: we've tracked them down to a gas station in ely.
speaker5: so why am i not witting with my feet up, smoking a jay, watching erin brockovich?
speaker3: we think he may be travelling in an rv with two british men sir.

speaker1: goddamnit, i knew we should have gone ahead with invasion in "â˜44. 
speaker2: no, sir. just a couple of nerds on the lamb from comic-con.
speaker1: my sister's kid went to that.
speaker2: i still think this stinks, sir.
speaker1: like fat man doo-doo. it's too much of a coincidence. he sits tight for 60 years and then suddenly now he decides to take off. if he wanted to go home so bad, he could've just given us the slip when he was playing golf with j. edgar hoover.
speaker2: someone must have told him. we need to find the rat.
speaker1: leave that to me. in the meantime, if e.t. is still m.i.a. in the p.m. then f.y.i. i'm tearing someone a new a. o.k.?
speaker2: yes sir.

speaker1: what do you think? 
speaker2: ask me when i've finished it.
speaker1: you tired, sausage?
speaker3: don't call me sausage in front of him.

speaker1: sorry. are you tired though? 
speaker2: mummy, i am bushed.
speaker1: what do you need?
speaker2: best case, i'd like a cold flannel on my neck and an honest meal.
speaker1: i hear that, big-rig. i can still call you big-rig can't i?
speaker2: sure. just not sausage. any luck with an rv park? we need somewhere off the beaten track, n'est pas?
speaker1: roger that. cup of joe?
speaker2: you read my mind.
speaker2: can i help you?
speaker3: you want a cigarette?
speaker2: no, thank you. i don't smoke.
speaker3: look, i'm sorry okay? about eating the bird.
speaker1: honey bun?
speaker2: could you unwrap it for me?
speaker1: by your command.

speaker1: let me ask you something. are you to...? 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: you know...
speaker2: no!
speaker1: okay, that's great. i just wondered. i'm cool with it. everyone's "â˜bi' where i'm from. it's all about the pleasure thing, you know? we've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity. i mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right? the human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like "â˜smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do. look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst. get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks. you think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum.
speaker2: what are you trying to say?
speaker1: maybe you should start smoking.

speaker1: great find, graham. 
speaker2: i sourced a website listing off the beaten track, north american rv parks.
speaker3: i really lucked out with you nerds, didn't i?
speaker2: it's awfully quiet.
speaker1: just the way we like it.

speaker1: stop doing that! 
speaker2: someone's coming.
speaker3: hello?
speaker1: we're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the american midwest.
speaker2: i don't think she heard you.
speaker1: i was talking to you.
speaker2: oh, sorry.

speaker1: hello? 
speaker2: good evening, i'm ruth behe.
speaker3: hello ruth. do you mind if we come in?
speaker2: sure. park in bay 9. the charge is $50 for the night, plus $10 for hook ups an i'll need to hang onto an id too.
speaker4: we're just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the american midwest.
speaker2: where you heading next?
speaker4: uh, east... apparently.
speaker2: england?
speaker3: yes. london.
speaker2: i love london.
speaker3: have you been?
speaker2: no. did you know it was founded by the romans in ad 43 as londinium?
speaker5: yes.
speaker2: oh. i'd love to go someday.

speaker1: you should. 
speaker2: there's lots a places i wanna go. europe. asia. the antipodes. the world's a big place. i need one of these though.
speaker3: you don't have a passport?
speaker4: ruth! ruth! get in here! i'm hungry
speaker2: that's my father. i'll come over and take your money in the morning. have a pleasant night now, won't you?
speaker3: doors to manual and cross check.
speaker1: hmmm?

speaker1: what took you so long? 
speaker2: i was just talking.

speaker1: you talk to much. 
speaker2: sorry papa.
speaker1: how long they staying?
speaker2: just the night i think
speaker1: hook ups?
speaker2: uh-huh.
speaker1: where they headed?
speaker2: east.
speaker1: them california plates i saw?
speaker2: yes, but they're from london.
speaker1: london, ohio?
speaker2: no, london, england.
speaker1: where?!
speaker2: england, papa. it's in north western europe.
speaker1: europe? i'll give you europe, missy. now, get and make my supper.

speaker1: arrghh, what the 
speaker2: hungry?
speaker1: i ate already.
speaker1: too soon?
speaker1: hey, i'm sorry. i'd love to break bread with you guys. what are we having?
speaker2: willies! paul gives clive a "â˜see what i mean?' look.
speaker3: i'll flame up the bbq pit. fire's my forte.

speaker1: hello clive. from the squirting of the gas and the flicking of the tongue, am i do assume you're a hendrix fan? 
speaker2: i am actually, yes.
speaker1: i met him once.
speaker2: really?
speaker1: yeah. nice man, really soft, he thought i was a hallucination.
speaker2: all the good ones die.
speaker1: meanwhile bryan adams releases album seventeen.
speaker2: so you've been here for 60 years?
speaker1: i know, right? time flies when you're confined to a u.s. military installation.
speaker2: why did you come to earth?
speaker1: i'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force.
speaker2: what?!
speaker1: i'm with you, man. i was on a science mission actually. meteorological reconnaissance. we were surveying atmospheric conditions on co2 spiking, m-class planets. my specialist subject is tornadoes right? so i'm buzzing around the mid-west, looking for twisters and all of a sudden my a.g.g. goes offline and i crash in the middle of some field.

speaker1: no, it's 52. area 51 is just full of old pan am jets and mini disc players and it's another "clever subterfuge."â graham joins them with the food. 
speaker1: just telling him about area 52.
speaker2: ha ha yeah.
speaker1: so, with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly, i figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing.
speaker3: mulder was right!
speaker1: mulder was my idea.
speaker3: would you like a go?

speaker1: who is it? 
speaker2: it's ruth.
speaker2: good morning.
speaker1: good morning.
speaker2: may i come in?
speaker3: yes.
speaker2: was everything to your liking?
speaker1: yes, thank you.
speaker2: where's the other one?
speaker1: the other one?
speaker2: it's okay, we don't charge by the person. that was three pairs of legs i saw last night cavorting round the camp fire, right?
speaker1: oh the other one. um...
speaker4: i'm in the can. i ate a closed mollusc.

speaker1: i like your shirt. 
speaker2: thanks. i got it at my church.
speaker1: why would want to shoot charles darwin?
speaker2: because of his theories. are you men of god?
speaker1: would you like a coffee?
speaker3: i suppose we're men of science.

speaker1: if we believe in anything it would be macro evolution. cause and effect. the establishment of a biological order from the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos. 
speaker2: or it could be you just don't know do you?
speaker3: created the earth in six days and on the seventh he rested.
speaker1: did you know that the universe has been dated as being 13.5 billion years old an that the release of neutral hydrogen at the moment of the big bang has enabled scientists to do this with categorical accuracy?
speaker2: yes.

speaker1: not you! 
speaker2: the world is 4000 years old.
speaker3: oh come on!

speaker1: horseshit! 
speaker2: explain to me how something as complicated as the human eye simply comes into being.
speaker1: oh, don't give me that old irreducible complexity crap-
speaker2: they eye is comprised of three interacting parts. remove any one of them and it ceases to exist. it has the precision and delicacy of a pocket watch and, when the good lord permits, it works in perfect harmony with its environment. something as functionally perfect as that doesn't just occur without the intervention of a guiding hand.
speaker1: but it didn't just occur did it? it is the culmination of millions of years of development across countless species.
speaker2: what are you talking about?
speaker1: evolution baby.
speaker2: it'd design!

speaker1: if he designed it, why didn't he just make it one part and take the whole weekend off? 
speaker2: nothing you can so or do can shake my belief, or faith in the sure and certain knowledge that made heaven and earth and created us all in his own image.
speaker1: oh yeah? well then how do you explain me?
speaker1: and that's jenga.
speaker3: what did you do that for?
speaker1: i didn't do anything, she fainted.
speaker3: she saw you!
speaker1: oh come on. who's gonna believe anything she says?
speaker3: the authorities will be on the look out for exactly this sort of thing.
speaker1: what, a delusional, one-eyed botherer?
speaker3: paul, right now they're going to follow any lead they can get.
speaker1: i didn't think of that.
speaker4: we could take her with us.
speaker5: what?

speaker1: we're only going to be a couple of days. we could let her go once paul's gone home. i'm sure she'll be fine once she gets to know us. 
speaker2: how am i going to get my passport back?
speaker3: leave it to me.

speaker1: hallelujah. 
speaker2: ruth, what in the lord's name-
speaker1: boo?

speaker1: hi. 
speaker2: where am i?
speaker3: hey, look who's up.

speaker1: would you like a cup of tea? 
speaker1: i'm so sorry it had to be this way ruth. we're definitely not going to hurt you and we'll let you go as son as we can. we were just a little concerned that you might call the police.
speaker2: you have been deceived. deceived by an agent of satan himself.
speaker3: you know i'm sitting right here?
speaker1: he's not a demon ruth, he's from another world and we're helping him get home. he's not evil. he's just very rude.
speaker2: how can he be from another world? there is only one world. our world, created by the father.
speaker3: look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the abrahamic, judeo- christian as well as all single earth theologies. science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone.

speaker1: how could that possibly make me feel any better? 
speaker2: christ, i was just trying to be nice!
speaker3: i think what paul's trying to say is, just because there are other inhabited planets, it's not the end of the world.
speaker1: this isn't happening! you're a hallucination. you're not real.
speaker2: you can't win can you?
speaker4: i can't drive like this. we'll have to drop her off and take our chances.
speaker3: no!
speaker2: oh, for sake.
speaker3: what did you do to her?!
speaker2: i broadened her horizons.
speaker3: can you broaden mine?
speaker2: no, it's tiring.

speaker1: oh please. 
speaker2: come here then.
speaker3: oh great! everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me. he always knew what was going on in buffy before me because his mum had cable.
speaker2: can't i just tell you?
speaker3: no spoilers!
speaker1: maybe i should make that tea?

speaker1: given your description of the intruder, the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us. 
speaker2: and who are you?
speaker1: secret service, sir.
speaker2: i knew it. you know that devil took my ruth.
speaker1: and ruth's your daughter?

speaker1: that's right. her mama died when she was born. i good as brought her up by myself. wasn't easy either. two mouths to feed and this place to run. 
speaker2: i understand. do you have a photography of ruth, mr. behe?
speaker2: she's pretty.
speaker2: do you have a phone mr. behe? in case she tries to contact you.
speaker1: i do...
speaker1: ...and she'll call me if she can. ruth's never really been outta carbon county.
speaker2: you say they went east?
speaker1: uh-huh. they'll have to get off the 191 after flaming gorge if they ain't using the interstate, there's been a rig spill just south of dutch john.
speaker2: so?
speaker1: so that means they'll be on the 44. only way to go.
speaker2: let's go. haggard!

speaker1: tell me you're gonna kill that thing, mr. zoil. kill it for what it is. 
speaker2: we'll do our best, mr. behe.
speaker1: watch yourself now. i seen its eyes. it's evil.
speaker1: speed, mr. zoil.
speaker3: man, that way was one fat freak!
speaker4: if i was that girl, i think i'd rather take my chances with the alien.
speaker2: can it, you two! how many times do i have to tell you?

speaker1: wow. 
speaker1: there it is, boys. wyoming.
speaker2: is that where we're going?
speaker1: maybe. i gotta tell ya. it's at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd aren't onto something. i mean look at it. hey ruth, get up here.
speaker1: ruth!?
speaker2: someone should go after her. graham?
speaker2: graham!?
speaker3: ruth!
speaker4: leave me alone!
speaker3: ruth, please stop, i've got shin splints.

speaker1: are you alright? 
speaker2: he can't be from space. it's not possible.
speaker1: ruth, you saw for yourself. it's not just possible, it's probably. there's probably millions of intelligent civilizations.
speaker2: so, where is everybody?
speaker1: well, one of them is right there.
speaker2: everything i've ever been told is a lie. my purpose. my truth. all false. do you know how that feels?
speaker1: just because your truth wasn't the truth, it doesn't mean there is no truth, ruth.
speaker2: huh?
speaker1: i understand you're probably feeling very confused right now. religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security. to stop us feeling lonely and unimportant.
speaker2: i do feel lonely and unimportant! how can this all be an accident? it doesn't make sense. did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth?
speaker2: how can that be an accident.

speaker1: it isn't, it's a coincidence. or it probably is. that's the beauty of the universe. 
speaker2: but what's the point? if there's nothing afterwards, what's the point in living?
speaker1: this is the point, ruth. right now. this conversation. that tree, your next cheeseburger. life is a miracle. people spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess, they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon.
speaker2: huh?
speaker1: carl sagan said "â˜a religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.'
speaker2: huh?
speaker1: it's okay not to know, ruth. it's wonderful because it means we still have things to learn. we still have life to live.
speaker2: i'm frightened.
speaker1: so am i, but it passes, sort of. ruth, we're on an amazing adventure and i think you should come with us. i know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that rv, you might just find the very thing you're looking for.
speaker2: i... i'm not sure.

speaker1: i'm sure ruth. i'm sure because i can honestly say, i have never talked to a woman for this long without blushing. 
speaker2: that's so sweet.

speaker1: she's going to be fine. i think your hair looks good by the way. 
speaker2: who's storm?
speaker3: from x-men.
speaker1: exactly.

speaker1: 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. come on! it's fun. 
speaker2: this is the furthest i've ever been.

speaker1: you don't mind, do you, graham? 
speaker2: it looks nice.
speaker3: hey, we should stop for something to eat. are you hungry, ruth?

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: i'm hungry.
speaker3: what's new, fatty?
speaker2: hey, it's not fat, it's power. i happen to be very strong.
speaker3: pick that up then.
speaker2: so childish.
speaker1: maybe i should call papa.
speaker4: what?!
speaker1: look, i've been missing for a whole day. if he's called the police, they'll be looking for us and if they find us, this "â˜amazing adventure' is going to come to an end real quick. i just need to tell him i'm fine and that i'll be back soon, okay?
speaker3: right up top!
speaker3: too soon?
speaker2: i did it!

speaker1: i won't be long. 
speaker2: we'll order food and wait for you at the bar.
speaker1: okay.
speaker2: be careful.
speaker3: tap water.
speaker4: ruth behe?
speaker1: yes?
speaker4: please hold, your call is being diverted.

speaker1: wait, i... 
speaker2: ruth behe?
speaker1: yes?
speaker2: agent zoil, secret service. listen very carefully. you're in great danger.
speaker1: how did you...?
speaker2: we know who you're travelling with ruth. i need you and your friend to turn yourselves in.
speaker1: what if we don't want to turn ourselves in?

speaker1: where are you? where are you headed? 
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: look, i know you think you're doing the right thing but i promise you, i'm only thinking about you. and paul. you care about paul, don't you?
speaker2: i don't know how i feel about him.
speaker1: yes he is.
speaker2: i asked him why he wore shorts and he said if he didn't i'd see his big spaceman balls.

speaker1: who's there with you? 
speaker2: ruth, please listen to me. your father is worried about you. we want to get you home. i need you to tell me where you are.
speaker1: he showed me things.
speaker2: you're not still talking about his balls, are you?
speaker1: i... i just want to know what's real. i'm confused. i... i...

speaker1: damnit, haggard! 
speaker2: hey, slow down there cyclops.
speaker3: i need to get to my friends.
speaker4: why the hurry? you know i got a friend with one eye who'd love to meet you.
speaker3: i happen to have two eyes actually.
speaker2: you should get that fixed up. reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the right light.
speaker4: yeah, the dark.

speaker1: papa said the lord would fix it. 
speaker2: the lord ain't gonna fix nothing sweetheart.
speaker1: no

speaker1: how's your dad? 
speaker2: we need to leave now.
speaker3: we're still waiting on a wet fries.
speaker4: holy it's the space faggots that dinged the fuck-mobile!
speaker3: look, i'm terribly sorry. perhaps we can exchange insurance details?
speaker4: i'm sorry i don't speak "â˜nerd'.
speaker5: these the "â˜friends' you told us about, baby?
speaker2: yes, they are.
speaker4: well whaddya know? small world.
speaker2: we were just leaving.
speaker5: i don't think so.

speaker1: leave her alone! 
speaker2: what did you say?
speaker3: he said, leave her alone.

speaker1: graham? 
speaker2: i'm taking you home.
speaker3: i... i can't.
speaker2: don't talk back to me, girl!

speaker1: what about papa?! 
speaker2: hey, we ain't finished with you.

speaker1: graham, take ruth into the rv and lock the door. i don't want either of you to see this. 
speaker2: yo fucknuts!
speaker2: so, who wants to get probed first?
speaker3: ha! only one of us fainted!
speaker2: tell me you got the food?
speaker4: it's them.
speaker3: who?
speaker4: it wasn't my fault. they answered the phone. he knew all about us.
speaker1: who? who are you talking about?
speaker2: get in the rv!

speaker1: was that your dad, ruth? 
speaker2: he was so angry.
speaker3: he's always angry.
speaker1: are you alright, ruth?
speaker4: i'm feeling pretty amped up. anyone wanna take a walk?
speaker2: i'm game.
speaker1: you want to come for a walk, ruth?
speaker3: thanks, but i think i'm going to turn in. it's been a long day what with meeting you guys, being abducted by and alien and having my whole belief system called into question.
speaker4: sorry about that.
speaker1: it was amazing though, wasn't it? remember when paul said "â˜yo fucknuts'? that was brilliant.
speaker4: you gotta talk the talk, right?
speaker2: what about when i got smacked in the nose?

speaker1: yeah yeah snorlax, you're a real hero. come on. let's skedaddle. you want anything ruth? 
speaker2: no, you go, i'll be fine. here clive.
speaker3: thank you.
speaker4: you can sleep in my bunk if you'd like.
speaker4: i'd use a pen to push the tissues off the bed. i've had a cold.

speaker1: hey graham. check this out. what d'ya think? 
speaker1: i'd look pretty hot, right?
speaker2: space cowboy.
speaker1: steve miller band. i love that song. speaking of midnight tokers, i got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants. do you guys partake?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: shame. i get it from the military.

speaker1: bob dylan's still alive. 
speaker2: is he?
speaker3: let's party!

speaker1: so why "â˜paul'? it's not very, you know, alien. 
speaker2: is it spelt like, p-'-a-w-l-l or something?
speaker3: no.
speaker1: p-o-o-u-r-l?
speaker3: no, it's paul. like paul newman or the little guy from simon and garfunkel.
speaker2: paul simon.
speaker3: paul simon. paul's not my real name. it's a name i got given.
speaker1: what's your real name?
speaker3: you won't be able to pronounce it.
speaker2: i can speak klingon.
speaker3: what a geek.
speaker2: hey!

speaker1: come on, what's your real name. 
speaker2: roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.
speaker3: roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.
speaker2: that's pretty good.
speaker1: rootchaa? that sounds like roger.
speaker2: you!
speaker3: calm down, rog.
speaker1: you look like a poster on a student's wall.
speaker2: that was my gag! "â˜take me to your dealer' right? yeah, that was mine.
speaker1: you never answered my question. why paul? who called you paul?
speaker2: the little girl who found me when i crashed. it was terrible actually. i killed her dog. i didn't mean to! my ship sort of landed on it. when the military arrived i was delirious; i kept saying "paul? paul?"â it was the only english i knew, because i'd heard the little girl saying it over and over.
speaker3: she called her dog paul?
speaker2: least it wasn't mr. muggles.
speaker1: what happened to the little girl?

speaker1: who knows? never saw her again. think about her everyday though. 
speaker2: it's strange, isn't it? ordinarily in this situation graham and i would be looking up at the stars, wondering about life on other planets but we know now, don't we?
speaker1: thanks a bunch, hurley.
speaker2: i don't mean that in a bad way.
speaker3: paul, can i ask you something?
speaker1: shoot.
speaker3: why are you in such a hurry to leave?
speaker1: i've outlived my usefulness.
speaker2: how so?
speaker1: there's only so much knowledge i can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a really nice meatball sandwich. the only thing i have to offer them now are my abilities.
speaker3: so?
speaker1: so the only way they're going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells.

speaker1: so what, do they take a swab from your cheek? 
speaker2: negative.
speaker3: stool?
speaker2: sadly, not that simple.
speaker1: blood?! oh my i hate needles.
speaker2: believe me, a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me.
speaker3: i don't follow.
speaker2: stem cells are multipotent.
speaker2: lineage defined?
speaker2: the camouflage response, the memory transfer, the revivification, they all originate in my cerebellum. in order to cultivate them in a laboratory they would have to...
speaker4: cut your brain out.
speaker2: bingo! fortunately, someone was kind enough to give me the heads up, if you'll pardon the pun. so, when they were transferring me to the medical facility and i noticed the bumper sticker on your rv, i figured you might be sympathetic types. i zapped the spooks, grabbed the wheel and took my chance.
speaker3: i thought the crash was our fault.

speaker1: well it was, kinda. 
speaker2: so, you're saying if they catch you...
speaker1: so tell me, are you guys virgins or what?
speaker3: no.
speaker1: alright then, clive, when was the last time you got laid.
speaker4: comic-con 2005. ewok chick.
speaker1: three years ago you had with a midget?
speaker4: she was an ewok!
speaker1: there are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an ewok costume.
speaker4: she was a midget.
speaker1: i can't believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature.
speaker4: i know. i'm sorry.
speaker1: was it nice?

speaker1: oh hey, wake up. wake up. we fell asleep. 
speaker2: how did that happen?
speaker1: sorry, i get this thing when i get high. it's called "â˜projective empathy'. you feel what i feel.
speaker3: like in e.t.?
speaker1: exactly.
speaker2: oh, thank for a second there i thought i'd got drunk on lite beer.
speaker3: oh dear!
speaker1: i can't walk through there.
speaker2: how are we going to get back?

speaker1: maybe we should hold hands, so that we look like a family. 
speaker2: that's great! two grown men who look like offenders holding hands with a child cowboy.
speaker3: you could be a midget.
speaker2: you're obsessed with midgets!
speaker1: seem to be working, clive. clive?
speaker1: clive, no.
speaker1: now's not really the time, sausage.
speaker3: i must have it.
speaker1: it's very cheap. are you sure you don't want to save up and get a proper on?
speaker3: oh, come on, we've got time.
speaker4: close on ruth's watch. she paces, worried.

speaker1: where have you been? i was worried. 
speaker2: good morning, ma'am. sorry to trouble you. agent zoil, secret service. your wagon here matches the description of a recreational vehicle we're currently looking for. may i ask, are you alone?
speaker1: yes, i'm alone.
speaker2: do you mind taking a look at these pictures?
speaker2: do you recognise any of these people, miss?
speaker2: miss?
speaker1: no, sorry i don't.
speaker2: where are you coming from, ma'am?
speaker1: christian ministry in seattle. i've been driving for 5 days.
speaker2: going far?
speaker1: austin.
speaker2: great town.
speaker1: oh yes. it has an impressive bat population you know?

speaker1: folks gather by the rive in the evening to watch them fly out. turn the sky black. quite a sight. 
speaker2: is that so?
speaker1: uh-huh. well, i really should be getting along.
speaker2: of course. thanks for your time, miss...?
speaker1: darwin, charlotte darwin.

speaker1: how's it going? 
speaker2: is that you?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: it looks like you.
speaker1: suppose it does. what's your name?
speaker2: keith nash.
speaker1: i'm paul. pleased to meet you.
speaker1: you on your own here, keith nash?

speaker1: my mom's shopping for some new jeans. she lets me wait in here. 
speaker2: sounds like a good mum.
speaker1: yes and no. what're you doing here?
speaker2: my friend's buying a sword. he's a grown man.
speaker1: what a nerd.
speaker2: you an mandms man, keith?
speaker1: i am but i shouldn't.
speaker2: strangers with candy, right?
speaker1: right.
speaker2: well, we've got a lot in common. we both like comics and mandms. guess that makes us pals.
speaker1: guess so.
speaker2: you read this one?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: it's a good one. take it. go on.
speaker1: thanks paul.

speaker1: i gotta go. 
speaker2: catch you later, keith nash.
speaker3: who was that?
speaker2: keith nash. how much was that?
speaker3: $299.99. it's made of a low grade turkish alloy.
speaker2: what did you get, speccy?
speaker4: x-men action figure.
speaker2: cheeeerist.

speaker1: don't lie, keith. 
speaker2: i'm not lying.
speaker1: oh, come on now, keith. if you carry on like this, you'll have to come with me to dress barn.
speaker2: honestly mommy, he was an alien and his name was paul!
speaker1: whoever hard of an alien called paul?

speaker1: what did you say, kid? 
speaker2: excuse me. who are you?
speaker1: agent haggard ma'am, secret service.
speaker2: secret service?!
speaker1: kid?
speaker3: he was in the shop.
speaker1: is he still in there?
speaker4: did he say where he was going?
speaker1: south. toward new mexico, huh?
speaker4: we've got him man! we're going to get a promotion.
speaker1: you did good kid. want a candy?
speaker3: no thanks.
speaker1: let's go.
speaker4: what about zoil?

speaker1: where the do you think you're going? 
speaker2: we picked up a lead, sir. little kid in the town said he saw an alien. said he was heading toward new mexico.
speaker1: and you were just gonna take off?
speaker2: thought it best to take the initiative, sir. we were going to radio you.
speaker1: well now, that's mighty civil of you. we have a chain of command. i expect you to abide by it. where d'you say he was headed?
speaker2: new mexico sir.
speaker1: well, then let's move it.
speaker1: oh, and haggard? don't go getting ideas about your station again.

speaker1: zoil, what the hell's going on? 
speaker2: they've double back sir. they're heading toward new mexico.
speaker1: you better be right about this, zoil. i'm getting a little tired of this i want that little fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.
speaker3: looks like you're going the wrong way, agent zoil. that's what happens when you don't got the lord on your side.

speaker1: he likes you, y'know? 
speaker2: graham? d'you think?
speaker1: what are you, blind?
speaker1: sorry.
speaker1: what you got there, a stigmatism?
speaker3: ruth nods.
speaker1: you know you can get on operation for that, right?
speaker2: papa said the lord would fix it. guess that's not gonna happen, seeing as we're living in a gigantic godless universe, with no hope of salvation.
speaker1: hey, i don't know categorically that it's godless. i just said "â˜probably'.
speaker2: oh, that's a relief.
speaker1: look, the way you're feeling now, that's why religion appeared in the first place. it's like existential prozac. imagine being five year sold and having no adults around to tell you why it snows or what trees are for. that's how it is for much of humanity. faith is a night- light. it illuminates the scary corners, fills the gaps, makes the universe easier to comprehend. thing is, it's okay not to know everything. i mean, who knows what's really out there? did you know astrophysicists recently identified the equation for the creation of matter?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: oh. well, then you get it, right? if they have the theory, who's to say at some point in the future they won't put it into practice and who's to say someone else didn't do that 13.5 billion years ago and that's how the universe came to be? course, then we get the eternal problem of who created the creator but that's a whole other car park. i think shakespeare said it best. "there's more in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy horatio"â.

speaker1: what did you call me? 
speaker2: horatio. it's from hamlet. you know, the prince of denmark?
speaker1: denmark has a municipal population of 508,691.
speaker2: anyway, if there is a didn't he create doctors and hospitals and scalpels and so he wouldn't have to go round fixing people's lazy eyeballs?
speaker1: i suppose so.
speaker2: the eye is a delicate and complex thing, ruth. you should get it taken care of.
speaker1: they're back.
speaker2: perfect.
speaker3: what are you going to do with this?
speaker2: phone home.

speaker1: satellite's come up with a data analysis on all the traffic coming out of prospect in the last 5 hours. there was only one rv, and guess what, nimrod? 
speaker2: it wasn't going to new mexico?
speaker1: that's a three pointer agent zoil. you better spin your around. you got some serious catching up to do. don't make me come out there.
speaker2: no, sir. where are they headed? if we gun it, maybe we can get the drop on their destination.
speaker1: they're on the 50, heading towards gillette.
speaker2: what else is around there?
speaker1: not much. thunder basis, bethlehem creek.
speaker2: bethlehem creek?
speaker1: holy

speaker1: you don't think she's still there do you? 
speaker2: that's what you're going to find out for me.
speaker3: us?
speaker2: i can't just knock can i? what if she's moved on and someone else answers? i'm sick of people fainting on me. i'll hang back with my buddy ruth, you two make first contact. just enjoy it.
speaker3: what shall we say if it's her? we're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago?
speaker2: yes. hurry up, there's going to be a really big storm in exactly 34 minutes.
speaker4: how do you know?
speaker2: it's my job to know.
speaker1: hello?
speaker3: knock again.

speaker1: who's there? 
speaker2: tara walton?
speaker1: leave me alone!
speaker3: okay.
speaker2: miss walton, i'm the writer, clive gollings and this is my friend and colleague, graham willy. we're from england and we're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago.
speaker4: what is this, some kind of joke?
speaker2: it's no joke.
speaker5: hello tara.
speaker5: aw nuts.

speaker1: maybe i should make some tea. 
speaker2: where are my manners? i never really have guests. nobody comes up here. i go whole weeks without seeing a soul.

speaker1: can i do anything to help? 
speaker2: i've only just stopped believing in you, y'know? spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night. my parents, my friends. everyone thought i was mad. they told me it was a meteor that squashed little paul. took me away and did tests they did, said it was for cosmic radiation. they said i was concussed, hallucinating, but i knew you were real. i pulled you from that spaceship myself. sat with you till the men came and took you away. if pop hadn't had to go to casper, he would have seen you too. they kept telling me i'd imagined it but i knew different. pop tried to understand but they filled his head with "â˜delayed this' and "â˜post- traumatic that'. he just used to smile and say "â˜there, there tara'. he got sick when i was seventeen and died a few years later. i inherited this place. word got out about my story not long after it happened, so i didn't really have any friends. kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names. i just kinda retreated into myself. i'd spend whole nights up on the roof, staring at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of you again. i always believed that one day you"â˜d come back and here you are.
speaker2: listen to me gabbing. milk and sugar?
speaker1: i'm so sorry.
speaker2: what for?

speaker1: for killing your dog and ruining your life. 
speaker2: that doesn't matter. don't you see? you're real. i was right and all those folk that said i was crazy? well, they can all go themselves.
speaker1: it's good to see you, tara.
speaker2: now, where do you suppose that came from?
speaker1: a duck! get out!
speaker3: 
speaker1: tara, where's the back door?
speaker2: in back.

speaker1: paul, wait- 
speaker2: clive?
speaker3: yes?
speaker2: a little help?

speaker1: freeze, space monkey! 
speaker2: we're cut off.
speaker3: storm cellar!
speaker4: godammit haggard!

speaker1: come on! 
speaker2: ow, my shins!

speaker1: papa? 
speaker2: come on.
speaker3: take your hands off her, devil!

speaker1: i'll drive! 
speaker2: punch it!

speaker1: your dad's persistent, isn't he? 
speaker2: you have no idea.
speaker3: i think we have a problem.
speaker1: what do we do?
speaker4: go left.
speaker3: what?

speaker1: what the is he doing?! 
speaker2: zoil. progress report!
speaker1: sir, i-

speaker1: in pursuit, sir. 
speaker2: who the is this?
speaker1: haggard, sir. agent zoil has been compromised. i'm assuming command.
speaker3: now wait a minute!
speaker2: i don't give a who's in command. where' my mooncoon?!
speaker1: just ahead of me sir. we're heading east across scrubland just north of mitchell creek.
speaker2: i don't wanna hear from either of you jokers until that little mother is under glass.
speaker1: yes sir!

speaker1: they're trying to overtake. 
speaker2: don't let him get past.
speaker1: shall i ram him?

speaker1: what are we doing exactly? 
speaker2: immense pressure and temperature drop. high winds, circulating in the troposphere, two opposed fronts clashing. oh, this is going to be a good one.

speaker1: are you sure you know what you're doing?! 
speaker2: twenty seconds.
speaker3: paul, we'll get sucked right up.
speaker2: stay on target.
speaker1: paul!
speaker2: stay on target.

speaker1: haggard, stand down. stand down! 
speaker2: he's mine. i can do this!
speaker1: haggard, it's suicide.

speaker1: it's gone! 
speaker2: where did it go?
speaker3: son of a
speaker3: haggard. wait a minute!

speaker1: you're not running this show any more zoil. you had your chance. 
speaker2: haggard, he knows what he's doing.
speaker1: so do i.
speaker2: it's a trap!

speaker1: okay. 10...9... 
speaker2: back where i'm from, tornadoes are part of our daily life. we've learnt how to live with them, how to understand them.
speaker3: they're gaining!
speaker2: we've learnt to anticipate their behavior, know their personalities, know when they're playing games.

speaker1: great caesar's ghost! 
speaker2: how did you do that? how did you know?
speaker3: evolution baby.

speaker1: we've lost them. 
speaker2: sorry.
speaker3: wait, what about papa?
speaker1: i only saw one car following us.
speaker4: where's tara?

speaker1: the bulb's gone in there. 
speaker2: that was just awesome. amazing driving clive. it was like g.t.a. but potentially fatal. wasn't it, clive? clive?
speaker3: oh no.

speaker1: there goes the deposit. 
speaker2: fare thee well friend. you were a faithful and mighty steed.
speaker3: she rode that storm with a bullet in her heart and didn't stop until we we're safe.
speaker4: if there is a benevolent creator watching over everything then may he, she or it bless the 1985 holiday rambler, imperial.
speaker1: paul?
speaker5: we're here.
speaker6: of course!

speaker1: zoil! what the is going on? 
speaker2: we got hit by a twister, sir.
speaker1: what about the other one?
speaker2: i lost him when the ranch exploded.
speaker1: christ, zoil, this has been one up after another. i should have handled it myself. i want that little dead by midnight tonight or you'll be working security in a convention centre. now where's that rv?
speaker1: zoil? zoil?
speaker3: what you may not know is on the outside of the tower they bolted a series of ladders, all the way to the top, put there by william rogers in 1893. he was the first man to climb the tower.
speaker4: i climbed up there in 1976. thought it would make a good site for some ufo spotting. turns out i wasn't the only one.
speaker5: we call them ifos.
speaker4: cute.

speaker1: this is it. 
speaker1: i'll miss these.
speaker2: pretty.
speaker3: what now?
speaker1: we wait.
speaker1: that was quick.

speaker1: wait a minute... 
speaker1: oh
speaker2: well, whaddya know? small world.

speaker1: lorenzo?! 
speaker2: it was you! you told him. i should've known.

speaker1: you've never made a mistake in your life. that's why i put you in charge of this mission. 
speaker2: he's my friend! i've known him for twenty years. he introduced me to my wife damnit!
speaker1: you stupid son of a in five years, you could have been where i am.
speaker2: i don't want to be where you are.
speaker1: too bad, seeing as i'm the one hold'ng all the cards and when i say "cards"â, i of course mean big gun.
speaker3: how'd you find me?
speaker1: it was pretty easy once we got a fix on the geek-mobile. wasn't hard to figure out where you were headed. you always did have a flare for the dramatic.
speaker1: let's go.
speaker4: he's not going anywhere.
speaker1: be honest with yourself, two scoops. what is it that you think you can possibly bring to the table at this stage in the game?
speaker4: blind fury.

speaker1: low grade turkish alloy. 
speaker2: step aside, you fat nerd.
speaker1: graham, his this man.
speaker3: leave him alone!
speaker4: leave her alone!
speaker5: leave them alone.
speaker5: you're not taking him away again.
speaker6: thank you, tara.
speaker5: don't mention it.
speaker7: the things i do for you, huh?
speaker6: you know i appreciate it.
speaker7: do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch you guys?

speaker1: oh lord, ruth. my little ruth. 
speaker2: noooooooooo!

speaker3: he's not a goblin he's from another planet.
speaker1: but he can't be. he... he...
speaker2: he's an alien you stupid man! oh ruth, ruth i'm sorry, i'm so sorry. i should have never persuaded you to come with us.
