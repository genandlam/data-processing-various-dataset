speaker2: really, ma'am. i have a job to do.

speaker1: daria steps back. 
speaker2: well, i suppose i should go up and see what they're selling.
speaker2: tommy...
speaker2: change of plans. he's gay.
speaker3: no way.
speaker2: yeah way.

speaker1: a look of alarm on tommy's face. into his mike -- 
speaker2: uh-uh.
speaker3: this isn't a conversation. do it.
speaker2: 
speaker4: key-card.
speaker4: why don't you keep my purse? i shouldn't be too long.
speaker2: ... aloha.
speaker5: hi.
speaker2: i hope you don't take offense at this... but i just have such a weakness for a man in uniform.
speaker5: if that's your thing...
speaker2: uniform's definitely my thing. i mean, i see a sailor, i'm thinking, mmm, seafood. y'know?
speaker5: i'm not actually supposed to be

speaker1: talking on duty. 
speaker2: who's talking? honey, this is a flirting... but you're probably just another good-looking man wasting it all on women. world's full of fools.
speaker2: yahtzee!... okay, mr. i-always-have- a-hard-nightstick. put away the pictures of those underfed, white males and let's broaden your horizons.
speaker2: i like sunsets and puppy dogs, and i'm big in the pants. just hope i'm not too cute for you. and don't tell me it's a color thing, hon, or i'll come over there and slap a little discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks.
speaker3: i'm hooked up.
speaker2: another big, hot, cuddly, black love- got there first. that
speaker3: sorry.
speaker2: hey... this day and age, sweetie, i can appreciate the monogamy. saving it for your number one is keeping the world safe, and it's okay by me. even if you are just breaking my heart... guess i'll just have to come in here someday, let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest -- just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me.
speaker3: i can be pretty rough.
speaker2: don't you get me all excited now. i was just learning to accept my disappointment.

speaker1: tommy sticks out his hand. 
speaker2: tommy. but you can call me rachel.
speaker3: douglas. and, man, i really gotta get back to what i'm supposed to be doing, okay?
speaker4: everything looks normal.

speaker1: faith. 
speaker2: faith.
speaker3: faith.

speaker1: holy 
speaker2: this will trigger the silent alarm. let's go. we got eleven minutes.
speaker2: ... i love colored stones... look at this...
speaker2: two-point-seven million.
speaker3: whose we stealing, anyway?
speaker2: drug dealers and money launderers.
speaker1: works for me.
speaker2: this i can use.

speaker1: pow. 
speaker1: go.

speaker1: your employer betrayed you. the police are on the way. leave the black stones. 
speaker2: who is this?
speaker1: you know the ones i mean.
speaker2: don't think i'll do that.

speaker1: go time. leave the rest. 
speaker2: tommy gets in. a swat cop signals him.
speaker3: move it out.

speaker1: stopped the trains. we're in the rabbit hole, they're sending down the snakes. daria comes with me. i got no idea where you should go, but you know where to end up. 
speaker1: faith.
speaker2: faith.

speaker1: okay to go? 
speaker2: just hang tight.
speaker3: nice.
speaker4: all clear.
speaker2: okay. get this train outta here.

speaker1: the stones. 
speaker2: you'll have to come and get 'em.

speaker1: enjoying california? 
speaker2: hope we're not here long. i hate sunshine.
speaker3: we may have a problem.
speaker1: the stones?
speaker3: the exchange was just robbed.
speaker1: ... let's hope that was part of the plan.

speaker1: who's in charge? 
speaker2: who wants to know?
speaker2: follow me.

speaker1: you know it's past your bedtime. 
speaker2: just a little longer.
speaker1: 'just a little longer'... school tomorrow, baby. let's go.
speaker1: 'exit.' 'quit.' 'do not save.' 'special.' 'shut down.' sleepy- time.
speaker1: you bag some z's now, you hear?
speaker2: okay.
speaker1: ... wait a second.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: i think there's something behind your

speaker1: ear. 
speaker2: oh, please, that is so lame. it's in your hand.
speaker2: how'd you do that?
speaker3: good night.
speaker3: angels east, angels west, north and south, do your best. guard her, watch her, while she rests.

speaker1: she'll stay down now. 
speaker2: she won't listen to me lately. only you.
speaker1: i'll have a talk with her about it tomorrow.
speaker1: i got some work to do in the office.

speaker1: i'm watching tv, if you need me. 
speaker2: what the happened?
speaker2: should we be considering a long vacation in a warm, foreign climate where there's no extradition?
speaker3: the guy who called was only interested in the black stones...
speaker4: christophe sold us out.
speaker3: or something.
speaker4: you made it.
speaker5: by the skin of my ass. some chinese dude kicked me around the block. busted my ear piece.
speaker5: snagged my loot, too... maybe time to

speaker1: rethink the no-gun policy. 
speaker2: little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'least you didn't have to play all foxy with the rent-a-cop.
speaker3: means this is all we got.
speaker4: so what do we do?
speaker3: you all wait to hear from me.
speaker2: where're you going?
speaker3: to get some answers.
speaker5: i got your back.
speaker3: no. i got us into this. i'll call you if i need you.
speaker4: be careful.

speaker1: so this is mr. christophe? 
speaker2: yes. only the handcuffs and fish tank are a new look.
speaker1: apparently we're not his first visitors today.
speaker3: please, monsieur ling --
speaker1: whatever you're going to say... make it the truth.

speaker1: bang. 
speaker2: like it?
speaker3: it's cool.
speaker2: want it? give you a good deal. ammo included... reactive armor, twin m240 machine guns, 120mm smoothbore cannon. guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and keep the neighbors in line.
speaker3: pass.

speaker1: how about a marine corps assault hovercraft? 
speaker2: i got other business.
speaker3: we're outta room over here, arch.
speaker1: stack 'em in the office, if you have to. then archie turns his attention back to fait.
speaker1: ... you weren't downtown tonight by any chance, were you, tony?
speaker2: don't know what you're talking about.
speaker1: me either.
speaker2: ever see black diamonds before?
speaker1: white, blue, yellow, pink. neil diamond. lou diamond phillips. black diamonds? solid rocks? no.
speaker1: you got me.
speaker2: find out how much they're worth.
speaker1: there a timetable on this, or --
speaker2: yesterday.
speaker1: that's what i figured.

speaker1: fait's heading out. 
speaker2: i'll be back. i gotta go over a guy who me over.

speaker1: looks dead to me. 
speaker2: guess you got to him first.
speaker1: not me. someone else.
speaker2: ... you're the one who called me. the one who took on my guy... who the are you, man?
speaker1: my name is su.
speaker2: cool. i'm sally.
speaker1: i want the black stones.

speaker1: yeah? make me an offer. 
speaker2: you can walk out of here.
speaker1: ... no deal.
speaker3: christophe here. leave a message.

speaker1: i know you're there, mr. fait. 
speaker2: who's this?

speaker1: the man for whom mr. christophe arranged to have the black stones brought into the country and deposited at the jewelry exchange. 
speaker2: fine. how much?
speaker1: maybe you didn't understand me. the stones are already mine.
speaker2: i got 'em, i'm selling 'em. so get your bid in or go yourself.

speaker1: i don't have time for this. 
speaker2: that your final offer?
speaker1: i can be a very dangerous man, mr. fait.
speaker2: everybody think i'm the goodwill or something...? look, i've had a night, and so far, i got zip for all my troubles. so i don't know who the you are, and i don't care. but hear this: you can beat my around the block all night -- brother, it ain't gonna get you those stones. a long beat. the two men facing off. then...

speaker1: give us the stones. 
speaker2: man, how many times i gotta tell people: i'm a business man. make me a offer.
speaker3: here's your offer.
speaker2: that ain't gonna do it, biggie. 'cause i ain't scared of guns, and i ain't got the stones.
speaker1: then you're gonna tell us where they are.

speaker1: over here. 
speaker2: man, what the hell's up with these stones? go.

speaker1: it's archie. bad news. we got a problem. 
speaker2: surveillance camera footage of archie's.
speaker1: ... i did what you said, right? put it out on the street, trying to get info on the stones. next thing i know, the jackson five here show up... now, there are three significant elements to notice here. one, i'm outnumbered. two, they're heavily armed. three, they're gonna beat me like a bongo drum...

speaker1: ... i mean, hey, i coulda resisted, sure -- and they coulda beat me into a coma or killed me or whatever -- but then, see, i'm thinking: how would i be able to tell tony what happened to the stones? right? what good am i dead or on life-support. so i threw in the towel. reluctantly, of course. for your sake. 
speaker2: okay. you saved yourself to tell me.
speaker1: what?

speaker1: who are they? 
speaker2: uh... don't know.
speaker1: what'd they say?
speaker2: well... 'give us the stones, motherfucker.' you know. that kinda thing.
speaker1: that's it?
speaker2: pretty much. yeah.
speaker1: thanks for keeping yourself alive to pass on all that valuable information.
speaker3: did you call the police?
speaker2: look around. are you crazy? then again, maybe you are crazy, 'cause i have no idea who you are.
speaker1: big question is, who's behind the boost?
speaker2: i don't know that, but i know they got great guns. i can't even get those. u.s. special forces only.
speaker1: ... chambers.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: he's wired into everything going down in this city, and he can get that kind of firepower. gotta be him.
speaker3: who's chambers?

speaker1: runs the biggest outfit in town. what warlords are to afghanistan, chambers is to l.a... and you want to take him on, you're on your own. game over for me. and now that i'm truly -- what the are you, anyway? you got some i.d.? 
speaker2: in chinese. clearly official.
speaker1: doesn't mean to me.
speaker3: let me see that.
speaker3: taiwan. central security bureau.
speaker1: you read chinese?
speaker3: no. but i know 'cop' in every language.
speaker1: what, you some kinda asian james bond?
speaker4: the stones belong to my government.
speaker1: yeah, well, they're chambers' now. and even governments don't go to war with him.
speaker1: i'm starting to hate this phone. what now?

speaker1: i hope you've reconsidered. 
speaker2: hey, it's mr. dangerous. 'sup, 'homie'?
speaker1: you've made this difficult, mr. fait.
speaker2: can't wait to hear.
speaker1: i have your daughter.
speaker1: she's very pretty in her pink pajamas. aren't you, vanessa?
speaker3: daddy!
speaker2: vanessa!
speaker1: i want my stones, mr. fait.
speaker2: motherfucker...
speaker1: you think about it a moment. let me talk to the chinese gentleman who's with you.
speaker2: don't you hurt her.
speaker1: that's up to you... the chinese

speaker1: gentleman, please? 
speaker2: he has my daughter.
speaker3: oh, jesus...
speaker2: he wants to talk to you.
speaker4: hello.
speaker5: i thought i killed you.
speaker4: i have the stones. no negotiations.
speaker5: do you really want one more person to die?
speaker4: no negotiations.

speaker1: what'd you just do? what happened? 
speaker2: i said i have the stones and won't negotiate for your daughter.
speaker1: you what?
speaker3: oh, jesus...
speaker2: it will confuse him. buy us time and keep her alive.

speaker1: what the fuck're you talking about? 
speaker2: look -- i know him. i want the stones, you want your daughter. we'll get them both back.
speaker3: ... i gotta work with you?
speaker2: you have no choice.
speaker3: ... we gotta go see chambers... oh, vanessa...

speaker1: find a place to put her. 
speaker2: my daddy's gonna come and kick your butts.
speaker1: su says he has the stones... but why cut me off? why not negotiate for the girl? it doesn't make sense.

speaker1: the buyers fly in tomorrow. should we stop them? 
speaker2: we'll never regain their confidence. we need information. find the right people. pay whatever it costs. something's not right. something's happening with the stones.
speaker3: what about the girl?
speaker2: we'll need her... she stays alive.

speaker1: i'm on the way to chambers... yeah, i know, but i got no other choice. just get the word into his pipeline that i'm coming and want permission to visit... i'll get back to you... faith... maybe chambers'll have a heart and give the stones back. yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join the peace corps. 
speaker2: i'm sorry about your daughter... how old is she?
speaker1: this ain't the biography channel. let's just get there.
speaker1: eight. she'll be nine in september.

speaker1: mine is fifteen... boyfriends... 
speaker2: never happen. i'll just kill 'em.
speaker3: i wish it were that easy.
speaker2: about time i got the 4-1-1.

speaker1: what's this all about? 
speaker2: the stones aren't what you think they are.
speaker1: no how about the guy who has vanessa?
speaker2: he's exactly what you think he is -- a thief and a killer.
speaker1: great...

speaker1: ling thug 2 hands car keys to charles. 
speaker2: where'd you get that piece of
speaker3: let's just say grandma and grandpa have a long walk back from the

speaker1: campground. 
speaker2: you're sure you cleaned it out?
speaker3: everything except the denture cream and adult diapers.
speaker2: i'm sick of her already.
speaker4: vanessa is standing inside, still yelling.
speaker2: shut up!
speaker5: you shut up!
speaker2: go to sleep!

speaker1: metz. 
speaker1: d.v.d.'s broke.
speaker2: get you a new one straight away, mr. chambers. metz goes.
speaker1: thanks for your patience. man needs his nightly rest. who's the gook?

speaker1: ... chinese guy. 
speaker2: ... no shoes in my crib.
speaker2: in.
speaker1: how you doing, jump?
speaker2: don't waste my precious time.
speaker1: ... i got a problem.
speaker2: how's daria?
speaker1: ... good.
speaker2: always was good. from the moment i found her till the moment you took her away from me. problem, you say?
speaker1: ... the black stones.
speaker2: brought it in. made me a lotta money. but that all stopped. you stopped that. you decided it was okay to put an end to that. black stones. go on.
speaker1: i need 'em back.
speaker2: only smart thing was not pimping her yourself, 'cause then i'da been real sore-angry, and you'da both been real cold-dead...
speaker2: but you don't pimp, do you? just a

speaker1: thief in the night. stealing what don't belong to you. 
speaker2: you like tall white women?
speaker2: he can't talk?
speaker3: i don't speak korean.
speaker2: bought myself this korean club downtown. packing in the seoul brothers 24-7-365... black man gouging koreans, ain't that a switch... got faces like walls, but they love to drink liquor and look at naked girls... place is no shitbox, either. got me an office looks like a kabuki love palace. my own little sanctuary -- a quick shot of fait, taking this in.
speaker2: -- just waiting for when i parole out... stop by sometime, eyeball the poon.
speaker4: ... jump, my daughter's mixed up in this. i gotta have the stones, or she's dead.
speaker4: if you need something more than that, here it is... i'm begging you, jump.
speaker2: big heist. risky heist. breaking news. i'm watching it wondering why.

speaker1: what's worth that kind of trouble, that kind of heat? gotta be something good. gotta be something expensive. 
speaker2: she's my little girl.
speaker3: make another one... lotta offspring running around. big scores're rare in a lifetime. another beat. that's it. no deal.
speaker3: slope's no dope.
speaker4: let me cut one of these motherfuckers.
speaker3: your choice.
speaker3: say hey to daria. and don't forget your shoes.
speaker2: i used to look up to that guy. all i wanted was to be like him.

speaker1: in taiwan, i could force him to talk. 
speaker2: this ain't taiwan. only thing we can do now is find out where the stones are and go take 'em.
speaker1: you make it sound easy.
speaker2: it won't be.
speaker2: ... they're at his club.
speaker1: how do you know?
speaker2: i know. i can feel it. that ever happen to you?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: i thought chinese people were all mystical and
speaker1: we like to gamble. not guess.
speaker2: it's no guess... but i could be wrong... we'll hit the club. you gotta see archie.
speaker1: archie?
speaker2: he's gotta remember something about the guys who took down his place.
speaker1: what if he can't?
speaker2: pretend it's taiwan. make him remember.

speaker1: hey! get away from there! 
speaker1: what are you doing?!
speaker2: whoa. take it easy. just seeing if i could help with something.
speaker1: you can't! it's very delicate equipment! stay away! just stay away from my truck!
speaker2: what?
speaker1: stay away from my truck!
speaker2: what?
speaker1: stay away from my truck!
speaker2: what? sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby.
speaker3: stop it.
speaker4: i want my daddy!

speaker1: i'm backing away... i'm backing away... 
speaker2: i want my daddy! i want my daddy!
speaker1: someone give the geek his ritalin.
speaker3: at least he's doing his job. which is more than i can say for some people.
speaker2: i want my daddy! i want my daddy!
speaker3: tape her up and gag her.
speaker2: i want my daddy! i want my daddy! i want my daddy!
speaker1: get the off me.
speaker1: ... waste of time... i can think of a better way of shutting you up --

speaker1: delicious daria. 
speaker2: 'sup, odion?
speaker1: long time no see.
speaker1: like cognac. just getting better. so what brings you around?
speaker2: ... sometimes you need an old friend, y'know?
speaker1: got trouble?
speaker2: ... with a capital 't.'
speaker1: tony fait? thought you and him were tight. bonnie and clyde.
speaker2: used to be that way. not treating me right these days. the kid's all he cares about.
speaker1: ... what do you want me to do?
speaker2: ... man, i don't know. probably nothing you can do. i just

speaker1: thought... hey, y'know, this is crazy. i don't know what i was thinking. i shouldn't even be here like this. sorry, odion. 
speaker2: nah, hey, hold up. it's okay.
speaker3: back in the day... just always seemed like you and i had something special between us.
speaker2: didn't know you thought so.
speaker3: i always cared for you, odion.
speaker2: ... you looking for a job?
speaker3: i need something.
speaker2: ... so maybe you could work here.
speaker3: here?... oh, man, i don't know.
speaker2: you were the best. not many girls pulling in two g's a night.
speaker3: yeah, but it's been a while for that... might not remember how.
speaker2: just like a bicycle, baby. you don't forget that stuff.
speaker3: don't know how jump'd feel about it.
speaker2: hey, you let me worry about jump,

speaker1: okay? meantime, why don't you come on in, and you and me can, y'know, talk some more about it. 
speaker2: ... just talk?
speaker3: ... no.
speaker4: they have boxing matches in the day?
speaker5: not exactly boxing. more dangerous. no gloves. no rules. big money. very illegal... started holding 'em during the daytime to fool the cops.
speaker4: the man you remembered -- how do you know he will be here?
speaker5: i don't. but chambers owns the operation, so i figure it's a good place to start. this is it.

speaker1: how will you recognize him? 
speaker2: i didn't see his face. but i'll know his pinkie ring when i see it. ten carats. round cut with square mount. good color and clarity. i remember thinking what it would do to my face if he hit me.

speaker1: how do we get in? 
speaker2: leave that to me.
speaker2: hey, man, how you doing? got a fighter here i want to enter.
speaker2: my man's gonna put the rest of these bums to beddy-bye. he'll go in there and get all chinese on 'em -- the teeth are gonna fly, the blood's gonna run... gonna be fun.
speaker3: whatever... you're number twelve, bruce.
speaker1: i didn't come here to fight.
speaker2: you won't have to. that was just to get us in.

speaker1: good day, over a million dollars'll pass hands in here. 
speaker2: find the ring.
speaker1: yeah. okay.
speaker1: could take a little while.

speaker1: sit down. 
speaker1: put on some music.
speaker1: nah. something slower.
speaker1: that's good... now just relax... and watch...

speaker1: hey. howzit? 
speaker2: what the you doing?
speaker1: pest control. don't tell me you didn't get your notice.
speaker2: what notice?
speaker1: see, that burns my right to the bone. i mean, hey, i'm here doing my job... anyway, putting that aside, if you had gotten your notice, you'd know there's a new city ordinance saying all businesses catering to foreigners gotta be sprayed.
speaker2: yeah? how come?
speaker1: 'cause foreign people're bringing all

speaker1: their scary-assed foreign bugs over here. y'know, in their luggage and and then the bugs're getting loose and everything up -- eating all the trees and everything, y'know, making people sick... anyway, city says we gotta spray to prevent any infestation and possible spread. 
speaker2: we're doing business inside. can't let you just start hosing the place with bug spray.
speaker3: yeah, well, maybe you should at least ask the manager about it.
speaker2: manager's busy.
speaker3: ... okay. your call. just know the city quarantine people'll be here first thing tomorrow.
speaker2: quarantine people?
speaker3: they'll be shutting you down for non- compliance... peace out.
speaker2: wait, wait, wait.
speaker2: city's really gonna come and close us up?
speaker3: quicker'n a zip-loc.
speaker2: ... you sure you're not with me?
speaker3: i'm a licensed exterminator. why would i be with you?

speaker1: look. let's do this. you let me start with a couple small rooms, y'know, offices or something, someplace you don't have customers. upstairs, so the fumes don't bother anybody. i'll pop off a couple bug bombs, and then we'll do the rest later. how's that? 
speaker2: ... yeah, okay. get the bombs, and come on.

speaker1: ... look. at. this. 
speaker2: just do your thing and go, bro.
speaker1: roger that.
speaker1: just keep the door closed and be sure to give this a full hour before anyone comes in.

speaker1: safe. he kneels. removes a desk panel. and... 
speaker1: take it down.

speaker1: even with the music, they're gonna hear it when i fire this tank buster. 
speaker2: daria. get ready to move.

speaker1: 'sometimes you need an old friend'... 
speaker2: it came from the office.
speaker1: watch her. don't let her leave.
speaker3: not here?
speaker4: they're here. somewhere else.
speaker3: what're you talking about?

speaker1: i'm telling you, they're here. 
speaker2: what're we gonna do?
speaker1: everyone out.
speaker2: what about you?
speaker1: i gotta save vanessa. i gotta find 'em.
speaker2: i'm not leaving you.
speaker1: yes, you are. go. now.
speaker2: t. come on, man. they're outside.
speaker1: shut up and get the outta here! that's an order!
speaker3: ... y'know, i got the big one...
speaker4: keep it in your pants.

speaker1: ... if you're willing to pay five, you're willing to pay ten. 
speaker1: you're willing to pay ten, you're willing to pay twenty. twenty, forty. forty, eighty... i'm not selling till i know exactly where the ceiling is.
speaker1: you like foreplay?
speaker2: how much money do you want for the stones?
speaker1: i hate foreplay. the warm-up drills -- girl's gotta get in there and be ready to score points. bring it straight to the hoop. you understand? so, instead of us going back and forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for you to think of a number. a very high number. a very final number. a number so high and final it'll get me off good, bam, right when i hear it.

speaker1: okay, okay... 
speaker1: ain't worth my life... i'll take the five and call it a game.

speaker1: ... by the way, when we do find him, what then? 
speaker2: i'll handle it.

speaker1: the midget ring announcer steps in with a mike. 
speaker2: seven advances, eleven's out... next up, eight versus twelve. eight versus twelve. fighters report to the cage.
speaker3: you're after the stones, too, huh?
speaker3: ... i did some more checking around to see what anyone knows about 'em... guess who get back to me? my defense department connection. now, i think he's calling me about this surplus f- 14 tomcat i'm trying to get my hands on. but no. turns out he's calling to tell me about a rumor outta taiwan about black stones --
speaker2: number twelve!
speaker3: -- only they're not jewels --
speaker2: number twelve!
speaker3: they're --
speaker4: twelve's right here!
speaker4: i'd be scared of him, too.

speaker1: let's go, chickenshit! 
speaker2: not today...
speaker3: i know it wasn't the plan. but if you don't fight, they're gonna toss us out on our asses. we might never find the guy.

speaker1: he's pretty beat up. 
speaker2: yeah. fell down the stairs... enjoy the jail sex, fait.
speaker3: better have the e.m.t.s look at his head.

speaker1: we're still here to help you, t. 
speaker2: anything you want us to do?

speaker1: not yet. 
speaker2: what?
speaker3: nothing.

speaker1: you win. 
speaker2: no quitting. get back in there.

speaker1: looking good. 
speaker2: nice rack.
speaker1: like the upstairs, like the basement,

speaker2: he's good.
speaker1: vanessa... he has the stones. there's no reason to keep her. hell, she's a little girl, she's eight years old -- she can't hurt him. he can let her go... he can just let her go... su just looks at him. not a chance. and he knows fait knows it, too.

speaker1: "low batt" flashes on the screen. 
speaker2: ... i lost the stones. ling has them... i don't know where he is... i have no way to find him... what do you want me to do? under which, the phone begins to ring. and...

speaker1: daddy, hurry! i'm scared!
speaker2: i know, baby. just hang in there
speaker4: fait's voice drops out as the battery dies.

speaker1: ... vanessa?... vanessa!... fait slams the phone down in frustration. 
speaker2: ... he's doing it here. tonight.

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: selling the stones... a dye laser emits green light. he needs it to activate them.
speaker3: what the you talking about?
speaker4: what are these stones?
speaker5: doomsday in disguise.
speaker5: they're some kinda new synthetic plutonium. small and portable, but mega-powerful.
speaker1: this fucker's making bombs?
speaker2: not making them.
speaker5: yeah, he'd need a big operation for that. why bother? just demonstrate the stones work and sell 'em to whichever international scumbag offers the highest bid. he makes millions, they make the bombs, then... 'look out, world.'
speaker6: ... okay, so we know what he's up to. how's it get us to vanessa?
speaker2: the buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly... somewhere private...
speaker6: vanessa said she's inside a big building. could be a hangar.

speaker1: man, there's dozens of little airports around here. we'd never get to 'em all. 
speaker2: ... flight plans.
speaker3: hey, yeah. flight plans show destinations. all aircraft file 'em with the aviation administration. if we could get a list, we could maybe figure out where the sale's going down.
speaker4: ... daria, call the aviation people. use our l.a.p.d. credentials. we need flight plan info for all private aircraft in this area tonight... everyone else get ready to move... miles, the no-gun policy's revoked. you break out the heat... tommy, you gotta get us a diversion.
speaker3: i can help with that.
speaker4: ... do it all fast.
speaker5: we're operational.
speaker6: the buyers arrive in less then an hour.
speaker7: ... so small. so deadly... we're selling conscience for money...

speaker1: ... but it's a lot of money... 
speaker1: be ready to kill the girl and go as soon as the sale's over.
speaker2: wick airfield...

speaker1: ... five private choppers arriving tonight within minutes of each other. 
speaker2: sounds like our best shot.
speaker1: .. it better be, or my baby's dead.
speaker1: let's go.

speaker1: so tell me... how the hell's taiwan fit into all this? 
speaker2: one of our scientists made the stones. tried to go into business for himself. we stopped him. recovered the stones... ling betrayed us. he took them.
speaker1: ling? he was one of you?
speaker2: we were partners. six of us. he killed the others. he thought he killed me, too.
speaker1: so what're you really after -- the stones or the payback?

speaker1: both. 
speaker2: ... yeah... let's get it all.

speaker1: but nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle... but what if it weren't?... that's the question that brought you here tonight... and here's the answer.

speaker1: ... new world order. as the buyers absorb this... 
speaker1: goggles off.
speaker2: one small fragment. transformed into a source of immense energy. more powerful than weapons-grade plutonium a hundred times its size.
