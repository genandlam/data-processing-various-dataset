speaker1: would you like to see... 
speaker2: brian... who is that?
speaker1: excuse me?
speaker2: who is this man i'm looking at?
speaker1: are you sure?
speaker2: are you asking me if i'm sure i know what my father looks like?
speaker1: people make mistakes in times of grief.
speaker2: man, look at the body!
speaker1: oh
speaker2: come on, brian. you know what my father looks like. he used to take you to little league.
speaker1: i'm sorry, man. i got a little nervous. this almost never happens.

speaker1: it's happened before?! you mean this is a normal thing?... this isn't burger king. you can't just mess up my order. 
speaker2: i think i know where he is.
speaker1: you think?

speaker1: i better .,see my dad in this coffin in an hour, or you're going to take his place. 
speaker2: don't worry. i'll get him, man.
speaker1: you do that.
speaker1: my people, my people, my people...

speaker1: muffled because of 
speaker2: the wrong body?! do they know where he is?
speaker3: they think so. they're getting him now.
speaker1: i told you not to use marshals. but no, you wanted to keep it in the neighborhood. i know swartz costs a little more, but at least they know where the bodies are.
speaker3: you were right. please don't rub it in, not today. i've got so much to worry about.
speaker3: dad insisted on having the funeral here, mom's crying all the time, ryan didn't help with anything, not like he ever does! plus my eulogy i can't wait until this day is over.
speaker1: oh come on, honey. i'm sure it's not that bad.
speaker3: if it is, at least dad's too dead to hear it.
speaker1: honey, it's going to be fine.

speaker1: it doesn't matter what i write. all anybody's going to be thinking is "why isn't ryan doing the eulogy? even i'm going to be thinking it. 
speaker2: baby, you're the oldest. you have to do the eulogy. besides, i think you're just as good a writer as your brother. you just need to let someone read your book.
speaker1: soon. it's not ready to be read yet.
speaker2: i'm sure it's fine. once the funeral's over, and everything dies
speaker2: sorry. look, once this is all over, you know your mom's thinking about selling the house, so you know we've got to get out.of here.
speaker2: you called them, right?
speaker2: aaron?... you put the down payment on the condo, right?
speaker1: i said i'd take care of it and i'll take care of it.

speaker1: you better, because i can't live with your mother anymore. i've done my time, now it's time for your brother to take over. from now on, it's only christmas and birthdays for us. once we move, we can concentrate on your writing and our baby. 
speaker2: hey, hey, hey. are you serious? we have to do this today?
speaker1: yes. today's the last day of this cycle.
speaker2: can i at least find the body first?

speaker1: i hate funerals. it's all death, death, death. 
speaker2: i don't think funerals are designed for anybody to really like.
speaker1: i don't want a regular funeral. when i die, i want people to celebrate my life.
speaker1: death at a funeral 02/6/09

speaker1: not me. i want it to be the saddest day ever. i want the stock market to stop. schools to close. and no garbage pick-up. 
speaker2: you still smoke?
speaker1: you used to smoke.
speaker2: i used to my pants too, but i stopped. the only thing i want black is my skin. at least open the window.
speaker2: i've got enough problems of my own to deal with.
speaker1: yeah? what problems?
speaker2: i told you... about the rash...
speaker1: got to use condoms.
speaker2: .on my hand...
speaker1: still got to use condoms.
speaker2: look at it.
speaker1: that's not a rash.
speaker2: what is it?

speaker1: i don't know, but it doesn't look right. 
speaker2: oh,
speaker2: if you hate funerals so much why are you coming?
speaker1: you know why.
speaker2: come on, man, leave elaine alone.
speaker1: i can't. she's the one.
speaker2: so you're going to win her back over a dead body?
speaker1: if i have to.

speaker1: are you okay? 
speaker2: yeah, just a little nervous...
speaker1: about seeing my dad?
speaker2: i just don't think i've ever been so openly hated by anyone before.
speaker1: he doesn't hate you. he just loved derek.

speaker1: great. that makes me feel much better. 
speaker2: at least you know it's not you, so try not to get so nervous when he's around.
speaker1: i can't help it. he puts me on edge.
speaker2: he's going to be more.concerned that his brother-in-law just died. he won't be focused on you. anyway, when i tell him we're getting married, he'll have to accept you.
speaker1: oh my are you okay?
speaker3: yeah, i'm fine.
speaker1: are you sure? is anything broken?
speaker3: it was my fault. i ran a light.
speaker1: i could have killed you. what if you had cracked your head open? i'd have blood on my hands!
speaker2: oscar, calm down!

speaker1: what's taking you so long? 
speaker2: i just started.
speaker1: you want this baby as much me. come on.
speaker2: i'm trying.
speaker1: if i didn't want you to come, you would have done it five minutes ago.
speaker2: do i have to do this today?
speaker3: who's picking up uncle russell?--
speaker2: oh uncle russell.
speaker4: hello?... how are you?... okay..

speaker1: so is this your father? 
speaker2: come on, man. you know that's my father.
speaker1: just trying to be professional. what up, michelle?
speaker3: brian.

speaker1: mom, how are you feeling? 
speaker2: there were so many things we wanted to do... we were going to go to china.
speaker1: china? you don't even like chinese food.
speaker2: that's not the point. i haven't been feeling good. who knows how long i'm going to live without him. it happens all the time. one spouse goes and then the next. i mean, it might be different if i had a grandchild to take my mind off of everything.
speaker3: cynthia, i-- they all cross to the coffin.
speaker1: come on, mom. you're healthy. you'll be fine. you've got your friends and family...
speaker2: where is ryan? have you heard from him?
speaker1: he'll be here soon.
speaker2: just seeing that boy's face makes me feel better. i've missed him so much.

speaker1: do you need anything, cynthia? 
speaker2: yeah, you can get your hand off my husband's coffin. you're leaving smudge marks.

speaker1: yeah, i found them. the ones in the valium bottle?... yeah... i'll get them to you this evening... can't do this afternoon... it's your fault you left them here... i've got a funeral... my uncle died... yeah, tragic... no, i haven't taken any. i saw what they did to you... what are they anyway?... 
speaker1: i've gotta go, my sister's here... i'll take them with me and stop by after the funeral... bye.
speaker1: hang on!

speaker1: hey, what's up? 
speaker2: do you always open the door half naked? come on, jeff. we're going to be late.
speaker1: i've just got to put my pants on and i'm ready.
speaker1: is he okay?
speaker2: oscar's freaked out. a guy on a bike ran into the car.
speaker3: it came out of nowhere. i didn't see him. i'm sorry.
speaker2: it's okay, baby. go put your pants on.
speaker1: i'm going. i'm going.
speaker2: here. take this..: it'll calm you down.
speaker3: what is it?
speaker2: it's just valium. i used to take them all the time...

speaker1: are you sure? i mean, i've got to drive. 
speaker2: it'll be okay. i'll drive, honey. come on, open wide.
speaker3: ready. let's do it.

speaker1: ryan! 
speaker2: i know this is hard, mom. but you're going to be okay.
speaker1: you always know exactly what to say, ryan. i'm so glad you're here.
speaker2: i'm always here for you, mom.

speaker1: i guess if people died every week, we'd see you all the time. 
speaker2: aaron, how are you?
speaker1: i'm alright.
speaker3: how was the flight?
speaker2: okay. i had to buy the seat next to me because i don't trust the airlines with my bags. and there was a lot of turbulence... i guess that's the thing about flying first class. it doesn't matter how much you pay if the plane crashes, you still end up dead-- uh...
speaker1: "end up dead"?
speaker2: oh
speaker3: i'll make sure she's okay.

speaker1: you didn't tell me the guy was in a wheelchair. 
speaker2: hello, uncle russell. how are you?
speaker3: where the have you been, you fat bastard? you're late. if you took any longer i'd be dead, too.

speaker1: it's hard to see dad like this. but he's in a better place now. 
speaker2: when does dead beat sick?
speaker1: i guess you're right. this is why i try not to get close to people.
speaker2: well that explains why you never call.
speaker1: what do you want me to say? some families talk to each other all the time, some just see each other at funerals. that's us.
speaker2: i guess it is.

speaker1: by the way, i'm going to need that money. 
speaker2: what money?
speaker1: the money for all this... the funeral.
speaker2: what about the insurance?
speaker1: that's mom's money.
speaker2: what about the pension?
speaker1: that's mom's money.
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: so we're spliting the cost.
speaker2: are we?
speaker1: yes. we are.
speaker2: oh, okay.
speaker1: so?
speaker2: i don't have it right now.
speaker1: what do you mean, you don't have it? you just bought a first class seat for your bag.

speaker1: so, poor old uncle eddie... 
speaker2: yeah. but he was sick for so long.
speaker1: dead? since when does dead beat sick?
speaker2: shut up, jeff.
speaker1: i love when you come to family functions, oscar. because then dad focuses all his hate on you.
speaker1: oscar?
speaker3: was there a dog in here just now?
speaker2: what?
speaker3: dalmatian? no, schnauzer...

speaker1: there's nowhere to park. 
speaker2: that truck is pulling out. park there.
speaker1: alright.
speaker1: what the hell?

speaker1: elaine, i was going to park there. 
speaker2: are you family, norman?
speaker1: well, no, but i'm like family.
speaker2: no such thing.
speaker3: hi, elaine.

speaker1: what are you doing here? 
speaker2: your father invited me.
speaker1: oh please.

speaker1: what's happening? 
speaker2: did you see that?... she totally blew me off.
speaker1: i said what's happening? are we there?.
speaker3: aw, i have uncle russell. how could i forget about uncle russell?
speaker3: yeah, alright!!
speaker1: what the is going on?
speaker3: ow.
speaker2: .barely even looked.

speaker1: it's very green here, isn't it?... green... very green... very... green. 
speaker2: oscar, are you alright?
speaker1: what do you mean?
speaker2: all this talking about phantom dogs and things being green... what's going on?
speaker1: what are you talking about? i' fine . never been greener. oscar wanders off, leaving elaine with jeff.
speaker3: elaine, what's wrong with oscar?
speaker2: i don't know. something's not right...
speaker2: i think it's the valium.
speaker3: valium?!
speaker2: i gave him a valium at your place. i think he's just not used to it.
speaker3: oh, right.

speaker1: you're going the wrong way! 
speaker2: ow! that hurts.
speaker3: stop the car, norman.
speaker2: what?
speaker3: stop the car. i have to speak with her. i have to speak with elaine.
speaker2: what about uncle russell? i need help with uncle russell!
speaker1: what's going on here? where are we?! we're going to be late!
speaker2: ow! can you please stop doing that?!

speaker1: nice to see you again. 
speaker1: who are all these people? i don't even recognize half of them.
speaker2: it's your family. you don't recognize them from the last funeral?
speaker1: so what side of the family is he on?
speaker2: who?
speaker1: the guy in the leather jacket.
speaker2: i have no idea. maybe a friend of dad's from work or something.
speaker2: so, you're telling me i'm going to have to pay for the whole funeral?
speaker1: no i'm telling you you'll have the money in a few months when i get my advance.
speaker2: i'm not a credit agency!
speaker3: aaron, how are you?

speaker1: yes, um... we're just waiting for everyone to arrive, then we can get going. i know you're in a hurry. 
speaker2: yes, i have two more funerals and a christening. i don't know what it is about the spring, but they're either coming in or going out.
speaker1: have you met my brother, ryan?
speaker2: ah, the writer, of course. i must admit i squeezed this job in because i wanted to meet you. i'm reading "mama's secret" right now. don't tell anybody, i'm not supposed to be reading that kind of stuff.
speaker3: i'm sure the lord will forgive you.
speaker2: you must be very proud of your big brother. he really made something of his life.
speaker1: no, no, i'm doing the eulogy.
speaker2: oh. i thought...
speaker3: aaron is the oldest.
speaker2: great... well, i'll just make sure have everything i need.

speaker1: we've got a body and a bible. well, i'm all set. 
speaker2: look, i think you should do the eulogy. everyone's expecting you to do it.
speaker3: no, they're not. you're the oldest.
speaker2: look most of the people are here for dad, but let's not kid ourselves. a lot of them are here to hear your eulogy.
speaker3: so imagine how surprised they'll be when they hear yours.

speaker1: how's my little sister? 
speaker2: i'm trying to hold it together, duncan. he was a really good husband. my friends always told me about the their husbands put them through. i never had to deal with any of that. remember when uncle matt got that nanny pregnant?
speaker1: that was horrible.

speaker1: they don't make 'em like my edward anymore. a good husband and a great father to two healthy, strong boys. 
speaker2: i'll make you a cup of coffee, cynthia.
speaker1: coffee can do many things michelle, but it can't bring back the dead.
speaker2: tea?

speaker1: "my father was an exceptional man... my father was an exceptional man... my father was an exceptional man..." michelle approaches him. 
speaker2: honey, we still need to finish that thing. remember today is the last day.
speaker1: can we talk about this when there's a little less death in the air?
speaker2: no. no we can't.
speaker1: honey, i'm just not in the mood...
speaker2: i don't have any on.

speaker1: what? you don't have any on? 
speaker2: i'm just trying to help you out. i'll put them back on before the service starts. now come on.
speaker1: babe, don't make it obvious, but that guy in the leather jacket standing by the wall. don't look. don't look. don't look.
speaker1: do you recognize him?
speaker2: isn't that the guy from the home depot?
speaker1: no, i don't think so. don't look.
speaker2: did he put in the cable?
speaker1: no, no, that's not it. he keeps looking at me. don't look. don't look.
speaker2: he's probably just a friend of your father's. i'll meet you in the garage. we have a few minutes before uncle russell gets here.

speaker1: what are you doing?! be careful with that. 
speaker1: hurry up, we're late.

speaker1: oh, ryan can you keep an eye out-- 
speaker2: damn, that martina has grown up.
speaker1: are you talking about little martina?
speaker2: she was like a teenager when i left, and now she's... you know. she's like
speaker1: can you keep an eye out for uncle russell?
speaker2: i think i should go see how she's been.
speaker1: yeah, why don't you do that? see if she wants a juice box.

speaker1: hi there. 
speaker2: hello.
speaker1: i was really sorry to hear about your dad. he talked about you a lot. i saw your wedding pictures. your wife's dress was very beautiful.
speaker2: uh... thanks.
speaker3: did he ever mention me?... frank?
speaker2: frank?... i don't think so, no...
speaker1: something like that, yeah. michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen.
speaker4: honey. can i see you for a moment?
speaker2: well, nice to meet you. thanks for coming.

speaker1: i think we should get started. 
speaker2: sure. can we just wait five minutes for my uncle russell? we can't start without him.
speaker1: .of course.
speaker3: it's so nice to see you.
speaker4: i'm so sorry to hear about your uncle. but he's in a better place now. i hear ryan is doing the eulogy.
speaker5: look... isn't it beautiful?
speaker6: elaine, can i speak to you for a minute?
speaker3: i'll see you inside.

speaker1: aaron. how are we doing on time? 
speaker2: as soon as uncle russell gets here we'll be ready to start.
speaker1: so what's this i hear about ryan not doing the eulogy?
speaker3: i was just telling him how much i'm looking forward to hearing your eulogy.
speaker1: that's a shame. i mean, i'm sure you'll be good, aaron. it's just with ryan being the writer of the family...
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: there are people here that don't even know your father. they just came to hear ryan.
speaker2: would you excuse me?
speaker1: so any new books coming out? i just finished "black hurt.

speaker1: are you alright? 
speaker2: every single person wants ryan to do the eulogy. he was my father, too. i'm supposed to do the eulogy! i'm the oldest. where was ryan when i was taking care of dad?
speaker1: calm down. calm down. forget about everyone. you're going to do the eulogy and it's going to be the best eulogy anyone's every heard. now could you please do me a favor and get me pregnant?
speaker2: come on, do i have to do this today?
speaker1: yes. what do you want? you want me to talk dirty? i'm gonna it. i'm gonna to it.
speaker3: is there more soda in here?
speaker2: yes! come in!
speaker4: what do you mean it's not valium?

speaker1: i mean what you thought was valium, wasn't actually valium. it's a hallucinogenic. like, acid, mescaline... special k... 
speaker2: this isn't funny, jeff.
speaker1: i'm not being funny. look at him, he's high as a kite!
speaker2: what the are you doing leaving that stuff around your house?!
speaker1: a friend left it. and who the just goes into someone's house and takes pills?
speaker2: i thought they were valium! what am i supposed to do? should i tell him?
speaker1: no, don't do that. it'll just freak him out... we'll just keep a close eye on him, and make sure he doesn't get out of control... and don't let him spend too long talking to one person... or bush.

speaker1: hi, dad. how are you? 
speaker2: not bad considering we're at a funeral.
speaker3: hi, dad.
speaker2: how's pepperdine treating you? is professor clarke still giving you a hard time?
speaker3: no, no. it's all worked out. don't worry.
speaker2: i'm not worried about you.
speaker2: so i see you brought your friend.
speaker1: he's my boyfriend. and you know his name.
speaker4: doctor, how nice to see you again.
speaker2: derek. how are you doing at the hospital?
speaker4: great. great. we should have lunch soon. i'd love to hear what you think about the new pediatric wing at cedar's.

speaker1: definitely. maybe elaine would like to join us for lunch? 
speaker2: elaine... jeff... good to see you.
speaker3: i'm so sorry, auntie. we're going to miss uncle edward so much.
speaker4: yeah. he was a great guy.
speaker2: thank you.
speaker3: oscar, this is my aunt-- oscar grabs cynthia in a tight hug.
speaker5: i'm so sorry about... the death...
speaker5: amazing grace / how sweet the sound / that saved a wretch like me...
speaker4: what are you going to do?
speaker3: i don't know. i can't leave. aunt cynthia would never speak to me again.

speaker1: you look nice, elaine. 
speaker2: i'm dressed for a funeral.
speaker1: yeah, but you make death look sexy.
speaker1: so, i heard about the engagement.
speaker2: hey, hey. i don't really have time to deal with whatever happened between you and me. but i have not told my dad yet, so i would appreciate it if you would keep your mouth shut.
speaker1: sure. anything for you.
speaker1: so that's him? that's the man you're going to spend the rest of your life with?
speaker2: yep, that's him.

speaker1: my father was an exceptional man... my father was-- frank again approaches aaron. 
speaker2: actually, there's something i'd like to talk to you about... when you have a minute. aaron hears uncle russell in the background.
speaker1: yeah, that's great. do you mind if we do it later though? my uncle just got here.
speaker2: sure.

speaker1: thank you, derek, you're a life saver. 
speaker2: no problem at all.
speaker1: how are you doing, uncle russell?

speaker1: terrible. 
speaker2: can i get a little help?

speaker1: ladies and gentlemen, could you all kindly take your seats? we're about to begin the service. 
speaker2: move! move!
speaker3: you stink.
speaker4: family and friends, we're gathered here today to mourn the passing of edward barnes.
speaker5: yeah, well, you left me to push uncle russell up that hill all by myself. then took all the credit.

speaker1: norman, shut up. 
speaker2: i'd like to start with a favorite passage of edwards from first samuel chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the king james bible.
speaker2: "and it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto saul, that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david, and jonathan loved him as his own soul. and saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house..."
speaker3: hey, elaine, i know you don't think i'm part of the family--
speaker1: 'cause you're not.
speaker3: .but when you dissed me back there, i had uncle russell in the car.
speaker3: you stole my parking space, and i had to push him half a mile up a hill. we almost missed the service!
speaker1: look, norman, if you poke me one more time, i'm going to kick your ass.

speaker1: what the is going on?! 
speaker2: she stole my parking space!
speaker1: stole your parking space?!. my father's dead! act right.
speaker3: ."then jonathan and david made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul..."
speaker3: ."and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to david, and his garments, even to his sword and to his bow, and to his girdle."
speaker3: and now we'll have a few words from edward's son, aaron. ryan's older brother.
speaker4: why isn't ryan doing the eulogy? this is

speaker1: good afternoon, everyone. thank you for coming... i never realized dad was so popular. it looks like he's got more friends now that he's dead. 
speaker1: my father was an exceptional man... he was born in 1938. he grew up in alabama on a farm. he loved to take long walks in the woods with his close friend, bobby. he told me how they spent their summer days riding their bikes through the fields and swimming in the lake.
speaker1: dad's first job was working after school as an assistant to an electrician named mr. thompson. back then, blacks weren't allowed to wear rubber gloves. so my father got shocked a lot. because of that, he had no feeling in his fingertips. i asked my dad what his first boss was like...
speaker2: did you just see that?

speaker1: see what? 
speaker2: the coffin just moved.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i'm telling you i saw it move.
speaker3: .he said he was a nice man, and surprisingly well dressed. when dad was eighteen, he left home after an argument with his father. he never told me what that argument was about, but i do know that after leaving south carolina, sadly he and bob lost touch and never saw each other again. dad went to college where he studied accounting, a decision which lead to a career in corporate finance... but his real passion was for the arts, with a particular fondness for theatre, dance and musicals. he was a charter member of the ensemble company and contributed regularly to the alvin ailey school of dance.
speaker2: there, look. it happened again.
speaker1: oscar, please-
speaker2: that coffin's moving!

speaker1: oscar. just calm down. 
speaker2: the coffin's moving!
speaker2: there's someone alive in there!
speaker1: oscar, please sit down.
speaker2: what the is wrong with you people?!
speaker1: oscar, where are you going?
speaker3: what are you doing?
speaker2: there's someone moving in there. can't you see?
speaker4: what the is wrong with you?!
speaker1: ryan, no!

speaker1: get away from there! 
speaker2: no, i have to show you! he's alive! he's alive!

speaker1: elaine, what the was that?! 
speaker2: i'm so sorry, aaron.
speaker1: oh, okay. my dead father's sprawled out on the living room floor, but it's okay, you're sorry.
speaker3: but the coffin was moving.
speaker2: please, aaron. go back inside. i'll explain later.

speaker1: no, i haven't made the call about the down payment yet. 
speaker2: i wasn't going to say that.
speaker1: no i'm not going to have with you.
speaker2: i wasn't going to say that.
speaker1: what were you going to say?

speaker1: hi. 
speaker2: i'll kill him!
speaker3: dad, leave it alone!
speaker2: leave it alone?! he just knocked my brother-in-law out of his coffin.
speaker3: it wasn't his fault.
speaker2: yes it was. my sister is in tears. i can't believe you brought this i don't ever want to see him again, do you understand me?
speaker3: i can't do that.
speaker2: why not?
speaker3: because we're... moving in together.
speaker2: are you crazy?
speaker3: dad, this isn't actually what he's like. he took some drugs and--
speaker2: drugs?! is he on the pipe?

speaker1: no he's not on the pipe. he took some valium and had a.bad reaction. 
speaker2: valium?! that's not a valium high. your mother was on valium for forty years. she never knocked over a coffin.
speaker1: dad, please.
speaker2: i just want to point out that you won't see derek knocking over a coffin.
speaker1: not right now, dad.
speaker2: fine. i've got to check on cynthia, but this isn't over.
speaker1: oscar.
speaker3: elaine.
speaker1: come and sit down.

speaker1: are you alright?... that was insane. he just fell out the coffin like a dead fish. i guess its not much of a metaphor when you're talking about a dead human, but-- 
speaker1: death at a funeral 02/6/0.9 49.
speaker2: norman, please.
speaker1: oh yeah... sorry. it's just that you never know when it's your time. like, i have this weird thing on my wrist. i've had it for a few weeks now. i don't know what it is--
speaker2: why don't you show it to my uncle duncan? he's a doctor.
speaker1: he is? great. thanks.
speaker3: i read your last book, "black hurt."
speaker4: good, good. thanks a lot.
speaker3: i'm not giving you a compliment you arrogant bastard. what a load of i wouldn't wipe my with it.
speaker5: i swear it was moving. i must be losing my mind... why are my hands so big?!
speaker6: oscar, listen to me. i need to tell you something...

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: now... you remember i gave you some valium earlier?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: well it turns out that it wasn't actually valium.
speaker2: can you hear me?
speaker1: hello?

speaker1: hello, doctor, i know this is a bad time, but i've got this thing on my hand. i've had it for weeks now... 
speaker1: what do you think it is?
speaker2: duncan, i'm going back now.
speaker3: you should probably go see a dermatologist.

speaker1: really? why? what do you think it is? 
speaker2: i don't know. it looks like some kind of pigment mutation.
speaker1: pigment mutation?!
speaker2: you're probably just allergic to something. maybe from shellfish, nuts...
speaker1: nuts? what kind of nuts?
speaker2: i don't know. pecans? peanuts?... excuse me.
speaker1: a pigment mutation?
speaker3: do you understand? hallucinogenic.
speaker4: yeah, now, the best thing to do is relax and just go with the flow. try and enjoy it.

speaker1: oscar! open the door.
speaker3: okay. breathe.
speaker3: it's going to be okay. breathe. you're and investment banker. you've handled mergers for billion dollar companies. you can do this. dead bodies don't move. they don't move. but that body was moving. it was moving.
speaker3: snap out of it! you can handle this. you can do this.
speaker3: alright. you're okay. stay calm... stay calm...
speaker3: that's it, oscar, keep it together. k.i.t. keep it together. k.i.t. keep it together. everything's going to be fine. nothing moved. dead people don't move. they're stiff.

speaker1: easy now. easy now. we can do this. a few hours. that's nothing. no sweat. i mean you've already been in here for... 
speaker1: where's my watch?!
speaker1: oh!
speaker1: it's already been...
speaker2: open the door. oscar.
speaker1: five minutes.
speaker1: 

speaker1:  
speaker2: it's alright.
speaker3: grief does strange things to people.
speaker2: i guess so.
speaker3: if you remember, i have something to talk to you about.
speaker2: oh yeah.
speaker3: is there somewhere private we could go?
speaker2: sure.

speaker1: uh... yeah. 
speaker2: like your big brother.
speaker1: actually i'm the oldest. i was writing before.he was. i've had a few pieces published in the new yorker.
speaker2: oh. well, you must be very proud of your brother then. getting all his novels published.
speaker1: so anyway. what did you want to talk about?
speaker2: your father and i were very... close.
speaker1: yeah. okay. that's good.
speaker2: and we spent a lot of time together.
speaker1: yeah, well dad was a fun guy.
speaker2: um... i've got some photos i want to show you.
speaker1: sure.

speaker1: that's me and your dad in central park in new york. 
speaker1: that's us on santa monica boulevard on halloween...
speaker2: so, where did you and my dad meet?
speaker1: just around.

speaker1: so... i mean you have all these pictures, but he never said anything about you. this is the first i'm 
speaker1: how did you know my father?
speaker1: oh
speaker2: are you really that shocked?
speaker1: i had no idea.
speaker2: i'm sorry. i'm sure he would have eventually told you, but i guess he wasn't sure how you'd react.
speaker1: uugg. like this.
speaker1: does my mother know?
speaker2: no. and there's no reason why she should... just as long as i get what's owed to me.

speaker1: a long pause. aaron looks over at frank. 
speaker2: "what's owed to you"?
speaker3: well, obviously i should get something... i mean, your dad and i were lovers, and he left me absolutely nothing in his will. how do you think that makes me feel?
speaker4: i'll tell you how it makes me feel cheap. like some cheap piece of ass... i mean, i'm entitled to something.
speaker2: what do you want?
speaker4: what i want is a lot, but i'm not asking you for what i want. i deserve thirty thousand dollars.
speaker2: thirty thousand dollars?! i can't just give you thirty thousand dollars.
speaker4: your father told me you were having trouble...
speaker4: look, your father promised to take care of me, and i made sacrifices to keep him happy.
speaker2: you think you can come in here, slander my father's name and show me a few photos of you and my dad dressed up going to see "dreamgirls"? i saw "dreamgirls" twice. i'm not gay. that's not proof of anything... "steppin' to the bad side / gonna take a mean ride."

speaker1: i'm not giving you anything but a-- 
speaker2: now i don't want to, but i will show these photos to your mother... do you really want me to do that today?
speaker1: wait here.

speaker1: oh oh oh 
speaker2: oscar. open the door. derek arrives behind her and leans in close.

speaker1: anything i can do to help? 
speaker2: not really, thanks.
speaker1: i guess you've got it under control.
speaker2: oscar?
speaker2: oscar! open the door.
speaker1: so what are you doing after the funeral? i've got maxwell tickets.
speaker2: look... i'm busy. i don't have time for your now get the away from me!
speaker2: oscar!
speaker3: .so you've never been to new york?
speaker4: i've been with my parents once.
speaker3: oh, that's not really seeing new york. you have to come visit me. when's your birthday?

speaker1: i turn eighteen next month. 
speaker2: great. all star weekend is in new york this year.
speaker1: i know. i know.
speaker3: ryan, i need to talk to you.
speaker2: not now, aaron.
speaker3: it's important.
speaker2: give me five minutes.

speaker1: what are you doing? what is it? 
speaker2: that guy that was here before, that we didn't recognize...
speaker1: the guy in the leather jacket?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: what about him?

speaker1: well, i was just with him in the study, and... and he showed me some pictures... 
speaker2: so? he showed you some picture?
speaker1: pictures of him and dad together at the premiere of "dreamgirls".
speaker2: look, is this going anywhere, aaron?
speaker1: ryan, he was dad's lover!
speaker2: what? no, no, no.
speaker1: the guy in the leather jacket just showed me pictures of him and dad together.
speaker2: no, no, no. i don't believe that. my father is not gay. i've known him my whole life. and he's the most non-gay man i've ever met. matter fact, he's so straight he makes me seem gay. and i know i'm not gay-- aaron pulls out the picture.
speaker2: uugg.
speaker1: uugg. i know.
speaker3: uugg/uugg.

speaker1: how can she be more interested in that than me? women. they don't know what they want! 
speaker2: it sounds serious, doesn't it?
speaker1: what?
speaker2: a pigment mutation.
speaker2: ooh, will you try this cake? i think it might have nuts in it.
speaker1: so?
speaker2: so?... aaron's uncle says i might be allergic to nuts...
speaker1: then don't eat nuts. put the cake down.
speaker2: i can't not eat the cake. that's what i do when i'm stressed. i eat cake.
speaker1: i bet you won't eat it when your arm falls off.

speaker1: will you just try it and tell me if there's nuts in it? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: come on.
speaker2: i don't want to.
speaker1: just do me a favor--
speaker2: get away from me.
speaker3: you haven't seen a pill bottle around, have you? a valium pill bottle?
speaker1: no. but can you try this--
speaker4: edward and i watched the tony awards every year. we would get all dressed up and sip cocktails. i'm going to miss him so much.
speaker5: don't worry. the way you look, you won't be far behind.

speaker1: i'm sure we'll start soon. 
speaker1: let's go inside.
speaker2: in a moment.
speaker3: doctor, i just have a--
speaker3: i'm sorry... you know... about... you know...
speaker2: thank you. i'll be alright. i know he's watching over me.
speaker3: you think so?' i mean, there are a lot of fine ones up in heaven. anna nicole smith's dead too, you know. might be watching over her.
speaker3: death is a terrible thing... did you check to make sure he.was wearing shoes? i hear they steal the shoes. and i hope you took off his ring, 'cause if it's worth anything, someone is going to take that, too.

speaker1: you don't understand. if we don't give him the money, he's going to show mom the picture. 
speaker2: okay. let me think, let me think.
speaker2: i think you should pay him the money.
speaker1: what do you mean, you think i should pay him the money? where the is all your money?
speaker2: i'm in debt up to my ass. i'm broke, man!
speaker1: so after paying for the funeral, the clothes, the catering... now i'm supposed to shell out thirty thousand dollars? he's your father, too.
speaker2: you're the oldest. besides, you've been living off mom and dad long enough. you must have some money saved. you haven't paid rent in two years.
speaker1: i have not been living off of them...

speaker1: well if you've got money problems and i've got money problems, what can we do? him! 
speaker1: you've got to pay him.

speaker1: yes, yes. keep coming. join the others. join the others. 
speaker2: oscar?
speaker1: oscar?
speaker2: oscar?
speaker2: oscar?
speaker1: oscar?
speaker2: oscar.
speaker1: oscar.
speaker2: os...

speaker1: are you alright? 
speaker2: no, my nephew is dead and these ate all the potato salad.

speaker1: ah! i think we're just about ready to start the service, so- 
speaker2: would you mind giving us five minutes?
speaker1: of course.
speaker2: thanks.
speaker3: is everything okay?
speaker2: no. i'm really sorry, honey, but buying a condo is going to have to be put on hold, just for now.

speaker1: what are you talking about? why? 
speaker2: babe, you know i wouldn't do this unless i had a good reason.
speaker1: what's the reason?
speaker2: i haven't got time right now, please.

speaker1: you? so you and my--. you?! it's you. so when i called my father and he didn't answer, he was with you?! 
speaker2: hey, hey, hey!
speaker2: what are you doing with my manuscript?! it's not ready.
speaker3: well, you left it on a coffee table.
speaker2: what's that supposed to mean?
speaker3: well, when you put things on coffee tables, it's assumed it's for everybody.

speaker1: it kind of is... 
speaker2: can we get to the point here?
speaker3: fine by me.
speaker2: if i write this check, then that's it. you give us the photos and stay away from our mother. deal?
speaker3: deal.
speaker3: is it your first one?
speaker2: what?
speaker3: the novel... it's a first draft?
speaker2: yeah. so?
speaker3: no, nothing.
speaker3: i tried writing once... didn't work for me, either. i think it's just a gift. you either have it or you don't... it must be hard for you though, especially since your younger brother is such a great writer.

speaker1: your father and i read "black hurt" together. truly amazing. we loved it. he was so proud of you. 
speaker2: thanks... i guess...
speaker3: that's it. i can't do it.
speaker2: aaron, what are you doing?
speaker3: there's no way in the world i'm giving him my hard earned money.
speaker2: don't be stupid. not today. i'll pay you back as soon as my money comes in.
speaker3: he comes in today! of all days, he picks the day of my father's funeral!
speaker2: he has the pictures!
speaker3: so what. who cares what he's got. let him show the world. put it on facebook. i don't care.

speaker1: let's just get it over with. 
speaker2: fine. this is on your head.
speaker3: what? no, wait.

speaker1: get out of my way. 
speaker2: let's just discuss this a minute.
speaker1: there's nothing to discuss.
speaker1: get out of my way.
speaker1: get out of my way. move!

speaker1: ryan, what are you doing? 
speaker2: get off me!
speaker3: aaron, help me!
speaker2: ah!!

speaker1: aaron, you got any rope or duct tape? 
speaker2: what?! i'm not a serial killer. i don't keep rope and duct tape in my pocket.
speaker1: well just grab something! there, from the curtains.
speaker1: tie his legs.
speaker2: this is a really bad idea.

speaker1: men. 
speaker2: tell me about it... how's aaron?

speaker1: how would i know? he's been avoiding me all day. we're trying to get pregnant. but i can't really do that by myself, can i? i feel like i'm making him eat brussel sprouts every time we do it. 
speaker2: the guy's father just died. don't you think this is a bad day for sex?
speaker1: don't you think i know that?
speaker2: i'm sorry. at least your husband didn't ruin the funeral.
speaker1: it's a funeral, it's already ruined. when you start off with a dead guest of honor, how much worse can it get?

speaker1: get that tie. 
speaker2: what am i supposed to do with the tie?
speaker1: whatever you do with a tie.
speaker2: i don't know what to--
speaker1: just stuff it in his mouth! damn, i have to do everything?
speaker2: apparently everything but write a check.

speaker1: aaron, do you know what was in this cake, i- 
speaker2: shut the door!
speaker1: what is going on? who is that guy?
speaker2: he's having a seizure.
speaker1: i just found some valium outside.
speaker2: yeah. great. give him some.
speaker1: it's okay. this should help. calm you down.
speaker3: have you seen a little brown pill bottle lying around--

speaker1: norman! i told you to lock the door. 
speaker2: you said "shut the door." jeff locks the door and looks shocked.
speaker3: what's going on?
speaker2: he's having a seizure.
speaker3: why is he all tied up?

speaker1: he's blackmailing you? over what? 
speaker2: if i could tell everybody, it wouldn't be blackmail.
speaker3: look, just trust us. he's the bad guy. we'll explain later.
speaker4: what are you going to do with him?
speaker2: yeah, ryan, what are we going to do with him?
speaker3: i don't know.

speaker1: you don't know?! come on, you're the big writer. you're the one who came up with "black hurt." dream up something where we all live happily ever after. we can't keep him tied up forever. how long do you think those valium are going to last? 
speaker2: valium?
speaker3: yeah, i found that bottle of valium. we gave him a few to calm him down.
speaker2: ah
speaker1: what?
speaker4: what? they all head over to jeff.
speaker5: what is it?
speaker2: the thing is... those pills aren't really valium. it's acid and... acid.
speaker1: what?!
speaker2: oscar took one by mistake. that's why he's acting crazy.
speaker1: jeff, what the are you doing with this stuff?

speaker1: a friend left them at my place. 
speaker2: what friend, amy winehouse?
speaker3: wait, you're telling us that elaine's boyfriend, who knocked over our father's coffin, had just one of these things...
speaker2: and you gave him how many?
speaker4: five.
speaker1: five?! poor bastard.
speaker4: i thought they were valium.
speaker2: maybe we should call an ambulance.
speaker1: you can't do that. i'll go to jail.
speaker3: he's right. if anyone finds out this guy's been force fed acid, we could all be arrested.
speaker2: so what then? what's going to happen?
speaker1: no... i don't think so... i doubt it.. probably not...

speaker1: ryan? 
speaker1: aaron?
speaker2: are you in there?
speaker3: 
speaker4: be out in a minute, mom.
speaker3: okay. we have to go out there. you two stay in here and watch him.
speaker5: watch him?! what do you mean, "watch him"?
speaker3: just make sure he doesn't escape. lock the door behind us. we'll deal with him after the funeral.

speaker1: how's it going, mom? 
speaker2: reverend davis wants to talk with you.

speaker1: lookie here, brother. i've been patient. we all know it's a virtue, but i'm about done with patience. now if we don't resume service soon, we're going to need to have a little conversation about my compensation. 
speaker2: sure. so sorry. um... can you just give us another five minutes?
speaker1: five minutes.
speaker3: is everything okay, boys?
speaker4: why didn't you just pay him the money?!
speaker2: why did you tie him up?!

speaker1: do you want mom to find out?! 
speaker2: what is wrong with you?

speaker1: what's your problem?! 
speaker2: women are my problem.
speaker1: no such thing as having a woman without a problem. if they didn't have problems, do you think they'd let us touch 'em? let me tell you something about women. smarter than you think they are. but not as smart as they think they are.
speaker2: she acts like she doesn't care that i exist. i mean how can she not feel what i feel?
speaker1: oh she feels it. she's playing hard to get. she wants you to work for it. look, let me tell something about women. they want a man who can control them. i know they talk all this oprah, beyonce "single women" bs, but what they really want is an old school man.
speaker2: really?
speaker1: listen here, boy. this is what you do: you walk up to her, slap her--

speaker1: slap her? you want me to hit her? 
speaker2: has not hitting her worked? look, then you grab her and kiss her. the harder the better.
speaker1: are you sure, 'cause that--
speaker2: oh, man, i gotta where's the can?

speaker1: i can't believe you gave him five. even if they were valium, that's too many. i wouldn't give a guy five cough drops. 
speaker2: hello?
speaker3: hello?!
speaker1: hello?
speaker3: i need the toilet.

speaker1: can't you use the one upstairs? 
speaker2: i'm in a wheelchair, you how am i supposed to get up the stairs?!
speaker3: hello?
speaker2: open the door!
speaker1: what are we going to do?
speaker4: we'll stick him behind the couch.
speaker1: just looking for the key.
speaker2: what the is wrong with you people? i'm about to take a dump in my pants!
speaker5: what do you want, derek?
speaker6: i just want to talk.

speaker1: please don't make me go through this again. 
speaker2: the only reason you don't want to go out with me is because your dad likes me.
speaker1: no. the reason i don't want to go out with you is because it was a mistake. i was drunk off my ass. you could have been a donkey.
speaker2: thanks.
speaker1: that wasn't a compliment. i'm saying i couldn't remember it.
speaker2: well i remember every minute of it.
speaker1: a minute, huh? that's why i don't remember.
speaker2: what is it about this guy? what has he got that i haven't got?
speaker1: okay, well for one thing, he's responsible. he's caring. he's considerate. he's thoughtful. he's stable. he's--

speaker1: well somebody had to look out for mom. 
speaker2: i've been looking out for mom since you got your book deal.
speaker1: you just can't get over it, can you? you're burning with jealousy because i left and did what you always wanted to do.
speaker2: i couldn't leave because i had responsibilities.
speaker1: don't put it off on responsibilities. you spent three years on a novel and you won't even let anyone see it! what are you going to do? wait until you're dead? you think you're going to be the tupac of books?
speaker2: at least i'm not some hack writing crap. mr. "mama's secret", mr. "black hurt."
speaker1: mr. "out of ink", mr. "blank page." at least my gets published.
speaker3: aaron, what is going on?
speaker2: michelle, please, not now.
speaker3: why are you acting like this? fine. we don't have to have today, but the condo? don't you want to get out of here?

speaker1: just tell her, aaron. 
speaker2: tell me what?
speaker3: listen... do you remember the guy in the leather jacket?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker3: well, i don't know how to say this, but... it looks like he and my father were having sex.
speaker2: what? no. not your father. with him?
speaker3: yes.
speaker2: no. your father was the straightest guy i know.
speaker1: that's what i thought.
speaker2: are you sure?
speaker3: and now he wants thirty thousand dollars or he's going to show everyone photos of them doing... stuff...
speaker2: stuff like what?

speaker1: hurry up! 
speaker1: have you got me?
speaker2: yes, i've got you.
speaker1: come on, quick, quick, quick.
speaker2: alright, i'm trying to see where the toilet is.
speaker1: pants down. pants down.
speaker2: no you do it.
speaker1: how can i do it? i'm handicapped.
speaker2: alright. alright.
speaker1: drawers. drawers. take down my drawers.
speaker2: who calls them "drawers"?
speaker2: it's all down.
speaker1: am i there? am i there?

speaker1: yes, yes. just sit down. 
speaker2: ooh, that's better.
speaker1: ahh!!!

speaker1: ahh!!! 
speaker2: ugh!

speaker1: please, please. just come off. 
speaker2: norman!
speaker1: what?
speaker2: you missed some.
speaker1: oh, i think i've got some of it in my mouth!

speaker1: oh, no. check him. check him. 
speaker2: hey, man, you alright?
speaker1: check him again. check him.
speaker2: man. hey. hey!
speaker1: wake him up. wake up. wake up. wake up.
speaker2: what's his name?
speaker1: i don't know. try larry.
speaker2: larry?
speaker1: shake him.
speaker2: larry, wake up. it's time to get up.
speaker1: maybe it's not larry. try something else. pinch him.
speaker1: he must be breathing. he has to be breathing. please let him be breathing.

speaker1: so that's it? we're just giving him all the money we've saved? 
speaker2: well, it's not that simple.
speaker1: why not?
speaker3: aaron refused to pay.
speaker1: how come you couldn't pay, ryan?
speaker3: that's not the point. besides, the only reason aaron tore up the check is because the guy started talking bad about his novel.
speaker1: your novel?
speaker1: you let him read your novel? you wouldn't let me read your novel. are you him, too? 'cause lord knows you're not me.

speaker1: hi. excuse me. hi. pardon me. hi. the hugesmile never leaves his face. 
speaker2: norman, why are you grinning like that?
speaker1: can you come to the study for a second?
speaker2: i'll be back soon. can you check on mom?
speaker3: sure.
speaker3: hey, are you doing okay? it's going to be alright.
speaker4: if you've never given life, child, how can you understand death?

speaker1: there's no point. 
speaker2: what do you mean "there's no point"?!
speaker1: look at him! he's dead!
speaker2: dead, dead?
speaker3: is there a "kind of" dead, aaron?
speaker2: what the did you do to him?
speaker4: we didn't do anything!
speaker2: well he was alive when i left.
speaker1: he hit his head on the table.
speaker2: oh no. this is really bad. this is really, really bad.
speaker1: what are we going to do?
speaker2: twenty-five to life.
speaker4: you know what, i really have to be
speaker1: you're not going anywhere.

speaker1: look, i'm not the prison type. they'll kill me. oh my i'm going to die. i'm going to die in prison. oh my do you know how fast a rash spreads in prison? 
speaker2: pull yourself together!
speaker1: thanks, man.
speaker3: look, no one here knows who this guy is. nobody knows his name. they probably didn't even notice him.
speaker2: didn't notice him? he's four feet tall.
speaker3: look, all we have to do is get rid of the body. it'll be like he came and left.
speaker2: get rid of the body?! it took me two months to get rid of a couch.
speaker4: did any of you happen to notice the size of uncle edward's coffin?
speaker2: you want to bury him with my father?
speaker4: why not?... i mean it's not like he's going to know.

speaker1: that's not the point. 
speaker2: you have to admit, it makes sense, aaron. the coffin's there, the hole in the ground's there... he'll be gone, finished, end of story... unless you have a better suggestion.

speaker1: it's funny. no matter what you say, i'm convinced we'll be together. 
speaker2: yeah, well, we all make mistakes... i used to be convinced i was going to marry prince. what happened there?
speaker1: you still could.
speaker2: you're an
speaker1: i'm serious. you only live once. you might as well do whatever it is that makes you happy.
speaker2: yes, but maybe i don't think of life anymore as all about me, me, me. maybe i've discovered there's something outside of myself that i care about. and maybe you should, too.
speaker1: that's kind of cold. i care about you.

speaker1: no, derek, you care about you. you only care about me in relation to how i affect you. there's a difference. 
speaker2: that's not true, elaine.

speaker1: hey! 
speaker1: i'm the man for you, and you're coming home with me.

speaker1: what is that?! 
speaker2: oscar!

speaker1: oscar! what are you doing? get back here and put your clothes on right now! 
speaker2: i saw you kissing him.
speaker1: i wasn't kissing him. i swear. please, baby, put your clothes on. we're at a funeral!
speaker2: you cheater! you cheater! you're committing adultery!!!
speaker1: calm down.
speaker2: i'm going to jump right now.
speaker1: remember you've got drugs in you. this isn't really happening. oscar, look at me.
speaker1: get out of here!
speaker2: i'm going to jump. i'm jumping.

speaker1: i'm going to jump. she's cheating on me! 
speaker2: oscar, please. come back here.

speaker1: there's just no way we can do it. it's impossible. 
speaker2: norman, it's derek. let me in.
speaker3: oh put him in the bathroom.
speaker2: are you in there?
speaker4: what's that?
speaker5: norman!! why is uncle russell on the toilet?
speaker1: i forgot!

speaker1: how could you forget?! what the is wrong with you?! 
speaker2: aaron, open the door.
speaker1: what is it?
speaker2: aaron, where's norman?
speaker3: i'm here.
speaker2: it's oscar, he went crazy. he's--
speaker2: what's going on?
speaker1: nothing.
speaker2: look, oscar's on the roof stark naked. he saw me kissing elaine and now he's threatening to jump!
speaker4: i've got to go.
speaker5: where are you going?

speaker1: i have to go out there. if he jumps, my sister is going to kill me. 
speaker2: wait here.

speaker1: get back here. be careful! 
speaker2: i believe i can fly! i believe i can touch the sky!
speaker1: oscar, come inside. we'll have some coffee.
speaker2: no!
speaker1: oscar!

speaker1: elaine, what are you doing?! 
speaker1: elaine! elaine follows oscar.
speaker2: what are you doing?
speaker3: i think i can get rid of this guy, but i need you to stay out here and try to stop anyone from coming in.
speaker2: okay. i'll do what i can.
speaker1: elaine!

speaker1: everyone's out in the garden... we've gotta move the body now. 
speaker2: let's go!

speaker1: quick. quick! 
speaker2: make sure no one comes in.
speaker1: hi!

speaker1: i'd like to make a confession. 
speaker2: i'm not a priest.
speaker1: that's okay, 'cause i'm not catholic.

speaker1: aaron, we have to do this. 
speaker2: what do you think favorite color is?
speaker3: i have no idea.
speaker2: i'll bet it's blue. the sky's blue. the seas are blue. and the winds blew, too.

speaker1: in a strange way, this might have been what he wanted. 
speaker2: be serious for a second.

speaker1: why do you say i don't take anything seriously? you complain about me all the time, but if i didn't play the bad boy, you couldn't play the martyr. 
speaker1: aaron's so great, aaron's so right, aaron's so responsible. why don't you try laughing and enjoying life once in a while? it might make you a better a writer.

speaker1: look, i must get to a phone. there's a man on the roof who's going to jump. 
speaker2: i'm addicted to strip clubs. the shoes, the poles, the smell. i just like to take my money and throw it in the air. i like to make it rain.

speaker1: oscar... please don't do this... 
speaker2: then why were you with him?
speaker1: i wasn't with him.
speaker2: yes, you were! i saw you!

speaker1: i'll never be good enough. not for your dad, and not for you. 
speaker2: oscar, please just come inside.
speaker1: no. you go inside.
speaker2: come with me.
speaker1: why?
speaker2: because you're going to be a father.
speaker1: what?

speaker1: i'm pregnant. we're going to have a child... 
speaker2: you're pregnant?
speaker1: i won't be able to do it without you.
speaker3: what about me?! i want a baby. would somebody get me pregnant?!

speaker1: great. 
speaker2: aaron?! oscar's off the roof!

speaker1: i'm going to kill him. 
speaker2: hey, is he gone?
speaker3: yeah.
speaker2: thank
speaker4: thank you.

speaker1: thank you're safe. 
speaker2: look, dad--
speaker1: elaine, stay out of this.
speaker2: no, i'm not staying out of this. remember how i told you we were moving in together? well, i lied. we're getting married.
speaker1: you're what?!
speaker2: we're getting married.
speaker1: elaine, you don't have to marry him just because you're pregnant.
speaker2: i'm not marrying him because i'm pregnant. i'm marrying him because i love him.
speaker1: how can you love him? he's an
speaker2: dad, this is my life. if you don't like it, too bad. but if you want to keep me and my child in your life, you'd better change your attitude, especially about my husband.

speaker1: elaine exits, taking oscar with her. 
speaker2: bye, dad.
speaker3: baby, i really think we should start again now. have you seen uncle russell?

speaker1: what the is going on in this place? 
speaker2: i'm so sorry, uncle russell. there was someone on the roof--
speaker1: never mind that. what about that dead body you dragged in here?
speaker2: what dead body?
speaker1: don't mess with me. i know a dead body when i see one. i live in a retirement home.

speaker1: did you hear that? she's having a kid! 
speaker1: how's your skin thing?
speaker2: oh that... it's probably nothing. i'm more worried about hepatitis c after having uncle russell's in my mouth. i think i'm feeling yellow.
speaker3: i'm telling you i saw the guy. he was dead!
speaker4: i know you did, russell. we all did.
speaker3: no! in the bathroom.
speaker5: i can't believe what a nightmare today has been.

speaker1: i don't know. it's been sort of exciting. 
speaker1: for a funeral, i mean...
speaker2: listen, about the condo and the baby,

speaker1: we'll work it out. let's just get this day over with. then we can worry about the rest of our lives. 
speaker2: i can't believe i still have to do this eulogy... with everything i've just found out.
speaker1: it doesn't change anything, does it?
speaker2: not a thing.
speaker3: we're going to have to fly through this now. i already missed a funeral and two christenings.
speaker2: sure. let's go.
speaker3: do you want an open casket?
speaker4: no!

speaker1: alright! everybody in their seats now! hey, you, sit down. 
speaker2: my father... was an exceptional--

speaker1: what the is going on? 
speaker2: there's someone in there!
speaker3: i knew it! i knew it!
speaker4: what the are you doing in my dad's coffin?
speaker5: edward! edward! edward!
speaker5: no! no!
speaker6: you bastard!
speaker6: he was with you!

speaker1: he had his... shortcomings, but he took care of his family. he loved his family. he loved this house. he worked hard. all i wanted today was to show him how much we all loved and admired him. to give him the respect that he deserved... is that really so much to ask? we all get so distracted by the... little things in life. we forget about the important things. like the fact that we lost a great man. 
speaker1: so maybe he loved "dreamgirls" more than most men. we don't know why a man makes the choices he makes. but i do know that my father made the best choices he could make. life is complicated. we're just thrown here together in a world filled with chaos and confusion... and we do our best. and dad did his best...
speaker1: he taught us to go for what we wanted in life, because you never know how long you're going to be here... and whether you succeed... or you fail...

speaker1: how's mom? 
speaker2: she's resting.
