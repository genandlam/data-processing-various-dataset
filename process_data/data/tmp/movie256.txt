speaker1: remove the and scrotum, make a deep, circular cut around the rectum. 
speaker1: cut from the rear to the brisket.

speaker1: you're dead. right now. i've killed you. 
speaker1: use your hands!
speaker1: drag it back yourself.

speaker1: what's wrong? are you hurt? 
speaker1: you were half asleep.
speaker2: i'll do better next time.
speaker1: german.

speaker1: in german w/ english 
speaker2: i'll do better next time.
speaker3: italian.

speaker2: i'll do better next time.
speaker3: spanish.
speaker3: spanish.
speaker1: in spanish w/ english
speaker2: did you really want me to snap your neck?
speaker3: how much did you pull off the deer?
speaker1: a hundred and twenty with scraps.
speaker3: about 200 pounds in total?
speaker3: that explains it.
speaker1: what?
speaker3: how you beat me. you're getting strong. hanna almost blushes.

speaker1: the great blue whale is the largest animal to have ever existed. a blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons and its mouth is large enough to hold 90 tons of food and water. 
speaker2: how much is that?
speaker1: it's bigger than the cabin. its heart weighs thirteen hundred pounds and a male has seven gallons of testicles.
speaker1: the blue whale's "music" can be heard for over 500 miles.
speaker1: time for sleep.
speaker2: good night.
speaker1: did you forget something?
speaker2: no.
speaker2: sorry.
speaker1: good night.

speaker1: what's music like? 
speaker2: it's difficult to explain.
speaker1: try.
speaker2: ã¢â€â˜music. a combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion'.
speaker1: but how does it feel?
speaker2: good. it feels good. it's, uh, nice.
speaker1: tell me properly. can you play music?
speaker2: your mother could. she used to sing very well.
speaker1: i'd like to hear it for myself.
speaker2: you will soon enough.
speaker1: how soon?
speaker2: when you're ready.
speaker1: i'm ready. i'm ready already.
speaker2: just go to sleep now. i'll see you in the morning.

speaker1: again. 
speaker1: again.

speaker1: i'm ready now. 
speaker2: maybe.
speaker2: you didn't tell me you had a knife.
speaker1: you told me to think for myself. isn't that what you want?
speaker1: i want to see things. i can't stay here forever.

speaker1: one, two, three, four... 
speaker1: ...five, six, seven, eight...

speaker1: did you see it? wasn't it beautiful, like thunder. i had to stick my fingers in my ears it was so loud. did you hear it? 
speaker1: what's wrong?
speaker1: what does it do?
speaker2: it tells marissa wiegler where we are.
speaker2: when you want to leave here all you have to do is flip that switch.

speaker1: but once it's done, there'll be no going back. she'll never give up until you're dead, or she is. you understand? i wont be there to hold your hand. so be sure. be sure it's what you really want. 
speaker2: you're not scaring me. he looks at her disbelievingly.
speaker1: it's here. there's no rush. take your time.

speaker1: laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of moscow, was the first animal to orbit the earth. she was launched into outer space on the third of november, 1957. scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions. her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and laika had always been intended to die. 
speaker2: that's sad.
speaker1: when a star collapses the supernova explosion is 10 billion times brighter than other stars.

speaker1: will you hunt with me? 
speaker2: if you want.
speaker1: it's up to you.
speaker2: me?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: i'll stay.
speaker1: fine. erik leaves abruptly.

speaker1: you were lucky to grab that deer. there was nothing out there today. 
speaker1: smells good.

speaker1: ma'am. we've had a signal reported by interpol. we think it's eric heller. 
speaker2: well i'll be.
speaker1: it seems he's in sweden. jokkmokk.
speaker2: what the is he doing there?
speaker1: living in the middle of nowhere, like the frigging una bomber.
speaker2: the son of a sweden? sweden?!
speaker1: apparently he turned on his locator.
speaker2: he's not an
speaker1: i know... i mean i believe so. but that's what happened.
speaker2: after 14 years in jokkmokk, maybe he'd rather go to prison.

speaker1: trouble was he had his own way of doing things. kinda paranoid. 
speaker1: not a team player. not a ã¢â€âœjoiner.ã¢â€â he became increasingly isolated and disturbed. kept mouthing off about classified programmes.
speaker1: i kept warning and he kept getting worse. in the summer of 1995 he took his girlfriend, johanna zadek, on a trip to the baltic coast and blew her head off.
speaker1: never heard from him again.
speaker2: anybody know why?
speaker1: maybe the pressure got to him, bob.

speaker1: what do you want us to do? 
speaker2: bring him in.
speaker3: what do you mean? call the police,

speaker1: - walt. this is exactly the kind of we can't have out there anymore. he was one of ours, we trained him. he kills some other poor woman and it's a cluster 
speaker2: tell it to interpol. let them pick him up. try him for murder.
speaker3: he's right. this has nothing to do with us. i don't understand.
speaker1: you don't have to. i'm making the call.
speaker1: thank you, gentlemen. that'll be all.
speaker4: hanna...
speaker4: tell me again?

speaker1: marissa weigler. 
speaker2: then?
speaker1: postcard.
speaker2: then?
speaker1: what?
speaker2: the address where we meet.
speaker1: wilhelm grimm's house. stephanstrasse 260. 10559, berlin. germany.
speaker2: good night my sweet girl.
speaker1: father...
speaker2: you can do this. you're ready. just remember what i've taught you.
speaker1: i'll see you there.

speaker1: is this guy one of ours? 
speaker2: used to be. tread carefully, he's been in there a long time, he's damaged goods, and he knows we're coming.

speaker1: mccullum? do you read me? 
speaker1: i repeat, do you read me?

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: ma'am, this is lewis.
speaker1: go ahead.
speaker2: the target escaped.
speaker1: how did that happen?

speaker1: we're thinking maybe he got away in the snow, in the thick snow, or... but he's in the wind and i have two men down. 
speaker2: find him, lewis. find him and take him out.
speaker1: ma'am. there's more. they found a child, his daughter.

speaker1: she hasn't moved since we brought her in. 
speaker2: has anyone talked to her?
speaker1: they want a psych evaluation before they interrogate.

speaker1: hello hanna. 
speaker1: my name is dr. burton. would you like to talk to me?

speaker1: i was told by my father to gain the upper hand. 
speaker2: really. interesting. what else did your father tell you?
speaker1: where am i?
speaker2: you're in holding.
speaker1: i see.
speaker2: this must all be very strange for you. you've been in the forest a long time. but i want you to know no one's going to hurt you. we just want to talk to you about your father. hanna seems to be staring up at the ceiling.
speaker2: hanna?
speaker1: is that a camera?
speaker2: ah, yes, that's a camera. to keep a record.
speaker1: camera obscura, it's latin for "dark chamber".

speaker1: plug the cctv through to langley. extension 247. 
speaker1: you should have visual on the psych evaluation now.

speaker1: it was first described by the arabic scientist ibn alhazen in the year 1021. 
speaker2: what's she saying?
speaker3: gobbledygook.

speaker1: i want to speak to marissa wiegler. 
speaker2: did you hear that?
speaker3: tell her i'll be there tonight.

speaker1: but... 
speaker2: just do it.

speaker1: john come and take a look at this kid's blood sample. 
speaker2: is that right? that can't be right.
speaker1: and i got a sample of her hair.
speaker3: that must be contamination.
speaker1: what contamination? what would it be?
speaker3: run it again.

speaker1: you're in a safe place. let's talk about your father. you must love him very much. 
speaker2: where did you meet him?

speaker1: lewis. 
speaker2: sir we need to talk to you. we've run tests on the girl.
speaker3: what tests?
speaker4: do you know where your father is?
speaker1: standard dna and meds.
speaker3: send the results straight to me.
speaker4: did he tell you where he was going? we're all worried about him.

speaker1: open up. 
speaker2: abort. i repeat. abort.

speaker1: you think she's out? 
speaker2: she can't get out.
speaker2: who's on the perimeter? detail every unit available.

speaker1: hello. 
speaker1: all right?
speaker1: don't you speak english?
speaker1: that can't be helped. you look terrible.
speaker2: who's she?
speaker1: i don't know. i just found her.
speaker2: what's her name?
speaker1: she can't talk.
speaker3: hanna.
speaker2: she talked.

speaker1: i live in leipzig. german city. population 0.7 million people. we live at number 7 weissingerplatz. i go to school at the klaus kohle gymnasium and my best friends are rudi gunter and clara schliess. i like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. 
speaker2: she's weird.
speaker1: i also have a dog called trudi.
speaker2: we had a dog called vincent, but he went mad and died.
speaker3: i'm sophie and this is my brother, for brains.
speaker4: come on, sophie! we'll miss the light.

speaker1: bye. 
speaker2: see you.

speaker1: do you need a lift somewhere? 
speaker2: no. i prefer to walk.
speaker1: suit yourself.

speaker1: she's in the desert east of essouiara. 
speaker2: have you got the dna results?
speaker1: we can't find them. it's possible she has them on her.
speaker2: okay. i want you to focus on erik heller.
speaker1: why?
speaker3: excuse madame, airline regulations state that -
speaker2: i'm in conference.
speaker3: all the same -
speaker2: back off, honey. i'm busy.
speaker1: you know this isn't going to go away.
speaker2: i'm dealing with it lewis.

speaker3: i need a room for one night. can you help? i don't have any money.

speaker1: it's the best we've got. 
speaker2: thank you.
speaker2: do you have one of these in every room?

speaker1: of course. all mod cons. 
speaker2: it's electricity?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: i know a little bit about electricity. they say edison discovered it, or was it franklin?
speaker1: some american, i'm sure.
speaker1: electric kettle for the english - they like to make their own tea.
speaker2: what is it?
speaker1: it's the best we can do.
speaker1: where do you come from?
speaker2: the forest.

speaker1: look. it's that girl. he nudges sophie. 
speaker2: hey you made it.
speaker1: hey, again.
speaker2: did you walk here?
speaker1: she looks different.

speaker1: do you want to hang with us? 
speaker2: are you hungry?
speaker1: miles is always hungry.
speaker3: i'm thirsty.

speaker1: the swedish borders are sealed. i have swedish, norwegian and danish border patrols on high alert and interpol have briefed the police. 
speaker2: i don't want any bad news lewis. neither of us can afford a up.
speaker3: i didn't think they let women in here.
speaker2: they let them in, they just don't let them get dressed.
speaker2: still drinking on the job. you haven't changed.
speaker3: you have.

speaker1: adapt or die. 
speaker2: you want a drink?
speaker1: i'll wait until i really need one.
speaker1: erik heller's still alive.
speaker2: you don't say.
speaker1: there's more.
speaker2: wow. all grown up.
speaker1: he did a good job.
speaker2: did she turn out like you hoped?
speaker1: she just tried to kill me.
speaker2: isn't it always the way?
speaker1: the does that mean?
speaker2: you bring them into this world, teach them how to kill and maim...
speaker1: i didn't teach her.
speaker2: no, it's better than that. you bred her from a test tube.

speaker1: here's the problem: she thinks we killed her mother. 
speaker2: just get her sectioned or something.
speaker1: sure, just as soon as she's done breaking peoples necks. you get her sectioned, if you can catch her.
speaker1: right now she's in morocco but she'll be trying to get out of the country. find her and bring her to me. quietly.
speaker2: i'll need funds.
speaker1: don't spend it all on candy.

speaker1: - only the papers found out he was like loads of other girls so she went and got all successful in her own right and now does a make-over show where she turns right dogs into real babes. i could do you a make-over if you'd like? 
speaker2: perhaps hanna doesn't want a make- over, sweetie.

speaker1: rachel doesn't believe in making the best of yourself. 
speaker2: no sophie, i just don't believe fourteen year-old girls should be dressing to look like stars.
speaker1: do you shave your armpits yet?
speaker3: i don't think so.
speaker2: good. keep it that way.
speaker1: that's sooo gross.
speaker2: do you often travel on your own, hanna?
speaker3: my father encourages me to be independent.
speaker4: and your mother?
speaker3: she's dead.
speaker4: oh, i'm sorry.

speaker1: nice one, dad. 
speaker2: people die.
speaker3: what did she die of?
speaker2: three bullets.
speaker4: oh. how terrible.

speaker1: why do we always have to get up so early? 
speaker2: if you were a berber shepherd -
speaker1: - i'm not a shepherd.
speaker3: we have to be at the port by eight tomorrow so i want you to pack now...
speaker4: i'm too sleepy.

speaker1: good night. 
speaker2: no, you're not. come on we'll do it together.
speaker3: she's weird. is it me, or is that girl weird?

speaker1: what does it mean? 
speaker2: music. a combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion.

speaker1: ... somebody broke the sun roof. i said somebody broke the sun roof. 
speaker2: call the rental.
speaker1: i hope its insured.

speaker1: typical. get me back to the european union. 
speaker2: don't be rude.

speaker1: what has got into you? oh my look over there. 
speaker2: it's her.
speaker3: you think she... you don't think she... rachel, the sunroof?
speaker1: you think we should say something?
speaker3: what's there to say?
speaker1: maybe she's in trouble.
speaker3: maybe she's a hooker. or a terrorist. there's a lot of them in germany.
speaker2: hookers or terrorists?
speaker1: i'll go over.

speaker1: all right? 
speaker2: did you know that 71 percent of the earths surface is covered in water?
speaker1: my father thinks you're a stowaway. he thinks you broke our sunroof too, which puts you in deep
speaker3: sophie just - i'll handle this.
speaker3: where's your father?
speaker3: i really think it might help if you told us the, you know, the truth and all that. have you run away from somewhere?
speaker1: are you okay?
speaker2: i'm fine.
speaker3: i'm worried about you.
speaker1: she said she's fine.
speaker3: you have to understand this really is a problem for us.

speaker1: you know what? why don't i stay here with her and you go off and be with dad? he's looking kind of tense. 
speaker2: has she even got a passport?!
speaker3: i don't think i handled that very well.
speaker2: how do you know she's not some kind of illegal immigrant?

speaker1: would you like some? 
speaker2: please.
speaker2: it tastes like music.
speaker1: you're so weird, aren't you? did you have a fight with your dad or something?

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: was it bad?
speaker1: no. i won.
speaker1: can you help me get home?
speaker1: you could do me a make-over if you like?

speaker1: you're pretty. you know that? 
speaker2: am i?
speaker1: of course you are. you've got pretty eyes and you're tall. i always wanted to be tall. if i were a man i might fancy you.
speaker2: i'm not a man. sophie laughs even more.

speaker1: okay, here's the deal. we're going to find a way to get you home just as soon as we get off this crate. but since you don't have a passport with you right now, we're just going to have to be a bit gorilla. 
speaker2: we passionately believe it's the right thing to do.

speaker1: you okay honey? 
speaker2: yes yes i'm ready!
speaker3: oh
speaker4: seb grits his teeth.
speaker3: here goes nothing.
speaker3: excuse me. sir?

speaker1: they're appealing for witnesses through the local media... 
speaker1: you think he really swam it?
speaker2: keep me posted.

speaker1: guten tag. 
speaker2: guten morgen.
speaker1: wie geht es ihnen?
speaker2: gutm und ihnen?
speaker1: jah, gut, gut...
speaker3: bonjour. ca va?
speaker2: ca va. oui. bien...

speaker1: maybe we could all go for a walk when we've put the tent up. 
speaker2: no thanks.
speaker3: hanna turns a display unit of postcards.

speaker1: i just feel connected when i'm in the countryside. the city stifles me... emotionally, creatively. 
speaker1: anyway, i was very young when i... seb and i.... he was so impressive.
speaker1: hanna?!

speaker1: it's probably just a bunch of spanish farmers, mum. we're hardly going to be out all night. 
speaker2: you're not going, sophie. no way, jose.
speaker3: food.
speaker4: that's gross.

speaker1: i don't know why i'm doing this, you're going to steal all the best men off of me. 
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: though quite frankly i don't need more digits than i've got right now. loads. loads and loads.
speaker2: it's like paint.
speaker1: don't lick it off.

speaker1: i can't walk in this. 
speaker2: you look hot.
speaker1: where are we going?
speaker2: shhhhh!
speaker1: i shouldn't take unnecessary risks.
speaker2: says who?

speaker1: what do they call this music? 
speaker2: banging.

speaker1: what you got? 
speaker2: in spanish w/ english
speaker3: nothing man. that guys just a friend.
speaker2: in spanish w/ english
speaker3: hey, you're not police. what the

speaker1: in spanish w/ english 
speaker2: where are you from?
speaker1: english? american? you like to party?
speaker3: will you teach me to do dancing?
speaker4: it's easy.

speaker1: he's after you. 
speaker2: how can you tell?

speaker1: duh, look at the way he's looking at you. he's gorgeous. 
speaker2: what's your name?
speaker1: sophie.
speaker2: have you come here before?
speaker1: all the time.
speaker2: really? you dance well.
speaker1: so do you.

speaker1: are we going to kiss now? 
speaker2: would you like to?
speaker1: kissing requires a total of thirty- four facial muscles.
speaker1: the most important muscle involved is the orbicularis oris muscle, which is used to pucker the lips - he kisses her. hanna closes her eyes. isaacs moves in.
speaker3: hanna! holy crap...
speaker2: please, don't hurt me.
speaker2: please, tell your friend...
speaker1: should i let him go?
speaker3: as opposed to what? yes, you should let him go.

speaker1: i'm going to go now. 
speaker2: sure.
speaker1: it was nice.
speaker3: oh, my hanna. i thought you were going to kill him. where d'you learn to do that?
speaker1: my father taught me.

speaker1: who is it? 
speaker2: hello katrin.

speaker1: you look different in pictures. 
speaker2: well here i am in the flesh.
speaker2: has erik heller contacted you?
speaker1: erik's dead.
speaker2: huh, if only.
speaker1: if he's alive why would he contact me?
speaker2: that depends on whether you believe he's innocent, or not.
speaker1: i'm an old woman with a broken

speaker1: - what's in the past, stays in the past, right? 
speaker2: something like that.
speaker1: so why all the years of snooping around and sticking your nose in?
speaker2: you'd understand if you had kids.
speaker1: kid's, they you up, don't they?

speaker1: can't you sleep? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: me neither.
speaker1: hanna?
speaker2: yes?
speaker1: where do you really come from?
speaker2: leipzig, i live in leipzig - sophie looses her patience.

speaker2: are we friends?
speaker1: yes. i like you.
speaker2: i'd like to have a friend.
speaker1: i mean you're a freak and everything, but i like you.

speaker1: i like you too. i really do. but there are things i can't tell you. 
speaker2: yes... actually, no, i don't.
speaker1: there are people that want to harm me. bad people.
speaker2: i see.
speaker1: and they wont stop.
speaker2: right.
speaker1: so for your own safety...
speaker1: can we still be friends?
speaker2: i don't know. i mean, i don't really know who you are. do i?
speaker1: that's just it. neither do i.
speaker2: what is it?
speaker1: i think it's about me. dna is kind of how we're made i think. i mean who we are.
speaker2: what will you do?
speaker1: i'm going to berlin. i have to meet my father at the house of wilhelm grimm.

speaker1: as in ã¢â€âœgrimm's fairytalesã¢â€â? 
speaker2: that's right.
speaker1: if you say so.
speaker2: did i say the wrong thing again?
speaker1: keep this. to remember me.
speaker1: it's a friendship bracelet.
speaker2: thank you.

speaker1: i need a room. 
speaker2: yes of course.
speaker1: i stayed here fifteen years ago. it hasn't changed.
speaker2: we don't much like change here.
speaker1: neither do i.
speaker2: name?
speaker1: olsson. peter olsson.
speaker2: you have some post.
speaker1: thank you.
speaker2: have you heard about the manhunt? a man has killed two coastguards. everybody is being asked to keep an eye out.
speaker1: for what exactly?
speaker2: i don't know.

speaker1: how long until you drop me off? 
speaker2: we should have you there by dinner time. from lille you can get a train to berlin. leipzig's just a few hours further.

speaker1: wake up. it's them. 
speaker1: keep your distance.
speaker2: is that the police? yes, i don't want to trouble you but i have a new guest you may wish to know about.

speaker1: ...they can live at freezing temperatures for up to nine months without food. imagine that, nine months. 
speaker2: why do you know so much about fleas?
speaker1: i read it in my encyclopaedia.
speaker1: also, they can jump around 200 times their own body length, which makes them the best jumpers of all known animals except for the froghopper. now they can really jump.
speaker2: everything all right?
speaker1: i think so.
speaker3: mama, i know you're disappointed in me, i know it. i'm so sorry, mama. but i have found maybe a way to make it better...

speaker1: i'm in a program now... a program to make babies stronger. 
speaker1: an american program. it's very scientific. important scientific work.
speaker1: erik says he can get these tapes to

speaker1: bastard. 
speaker2: - he says i look beautiful. i don't feel beautiful...
speaker3: ...i'm not sure if it's true that the baby can hear, but at night i sing. i hope it hears me.
speaker1: what?
speaker4: frau wiegler, this is reception. i have one erik heller for you.
speaker1: put him on.
speaker5: you were supposed to be dead.
speaker1: so were you.

speaker1: well, here we are. 
speaker2: how did you know i was here?
speaker1: i killed one of your men. got his cellphone. you've gotten soft.
speaker2: no, i just grew up. the world's changed since you died.
speaker1: you got kids?
speaker2: no, i made choices.
speaker1: hanna's practically yours, you know?

speaker1: not interested. 
speaker2: she's true and good and funny. yeah, she's funny. she's special.
speaker1: i'm looking forward to it.
speaker2: you'll have to catch her first.

speaker1: i think we're lost, hanna. 
speaker1: i'm going to pull over.
speaker2: no, don't.
speaker1: i need to check the map.

speaker1: why won't that car pass? he has his lights on high beam, i was doing everything i could to get out of the way... 
speaker2: are we stopped? i need to pee.
speaker1: well, i don't want you going too far right now.
speaker3: i think you should stay where you are, sophie.
speaker1: hanna, what's going on. seb wake up.
speaker3: please.
speaker2: this is creepy. you're creeping me out.
speaker4: are we in lille?
speaker3: i'm sorry. but you really mustn't get out of the van.

speaker1: what ever you do, don't follow me. 
speaker2: i promise.
speaker3: hanna, tell me what's going on or seb will go over to that car and find out.

speaker1: like i will. everyone stay put. where's my phone? 
speaker2: thank you for being my friend.
speaker3: hanna!

speaker1: don't be a silly girl, hanna. you need to come with me now. i know where your papa is. 
speaker1: he wants to talk to you, hanna. he misses you.

speaker1: would you please stop crying? 
speaker2: i'm not telling you anything.
speaker1: honey, your friend is in a lot of danger. you need to help us find her.
speaker2: i don't know where to find her!
speaker1: do you know him?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: he knows you.
speaker3: we gave her a ride because we thought she was in trouble.
speaker1: but you knew she didn't have a passport. you smuggled her into port and helped her illegally gain

speaker1: there is no klaus kohle gymnasium. it closed five years ago. 
speaker1: did she give any idea of where she was going?
speaker2: she said she was going home, to leipzig. she seemed lost. like she needed taking care of. you understand.
speaker1: this was hanna's mother, joanna zadek. fifteen years ago hanna's father shot her to death on a camping holiday by the baltic.
speaker3: she was odd. i'll give you that. disconnected. i mean i get on with most kids, you know, have a rapport. but, this one -
speaker1: you know, mr lyall, it's days like these that i really hate my job.
speaker3: i'm sure you do.
speaker1: it's a very, very difficult thing to do.
speaker3: absolutely.
speaker1: but sometimes children are bad people too.

speaker1: i'm not going to hurt you. 
speaker1: miles is a nice name. are you a nice boy?
speaker2: hey what's going on in there? we don't have to put up with this!

speaker1: three days ago hanna's father killed two danish policemen on a beach with a hunting knife. 
speaker2: where is he now?
speaker1: he's still at large and he's still very dangerous. we need to find hanna before he does.
speaker1: if you know anything at all, it's vital you tell us for her own safety. we are now very worried about her.
speaker3: but sophie doesn't say a word.
speaker4: sophie?
speaker5: she's going to berlin. to wilhelm grimm's house.
speaker6: you little bastard!
speaker4: how did you know that?
speaker6: you fuckwad!
speaker2: hey hey hey! sophie for sake.

speaker1: i've looked through heller's contacts from the 1980's. there's no one called wilhelm. 
speaker2: wilhelm grimm wrote fairy-tales. he died two hundred years ago.

speaker1: what the is this? 
speaker2: wilhelm's house. drive on.

speaker1: excuse me young lady? 
speaker2: are you wilhelm grimm?

speaker1: so you are hanna. 
speaker1: it's very nice to meet you, hanna.

speaker2: what happened to it?
speaker1: no car park. you need a car park these days, otherwise people wont come. but somebody has to watch over it...
speaker2: it's beautiful.
speaker1: i like it too. erik used to come here a great deal.
speaker2: have you heard from him?
speaker1: you must wait. he will be here soon.

speaker1: please, sit down. 
speaker1: would you like an egg? they're fresh.
speaker2: please.
speaker1: you'll need a fresh photograph. don't get it wet.
speaker2: i don't really understand.
speaker1: id. identity. it tells people who you are.
speaker1: there is an apartment ready for you in the south. erik will come and the car will take you there today.
speaker2: do i have to?
speaker1: don't you want to?

speaker1: i don't know. i miss the forest. i miss my home. 
speaker2: that's to be expected. but the city is so exciting, don't you think?
speaker1: i suppose.
speaker1: did you know my mother?
speaker2: i did.
speaker1: what was she like?
speaker2: she was very gentle, she was very funny, very talented - a singer - did you know that?
speaker1: yes...
speaker2: she had your eyes. he smiles at her.
speaker1: it's him.
speaker2: quick.

speaker1: listen to me, listen. there is no one here. there is nobody up there... 
speaker2: check the attic.
speaker2: erik heller? do you know him?
speaker1: i have never heard of him.
speaker2: really?
speaker1: i don't know these people.

speaker1: think very carefully 
speaker2: he called me. she's coming soon. to meet him.
speaker1: when?
speaker2: tomorrow! tomorrow morning.
speaker1: take him in there. find out what he knows.

speaker1: lewis. it's marissa. 
speaker1: you got anything? he's coming here. i can smell it. double the men. but, lewis, i want to talk to him.
speaker2: his name's klaus knepfler. he used to send heller's things from berlin before the communists were kicked out of prague.
speaker1: how much does he know about the programme?

speaker1: everything. he knew johanna. 
speaker2: what does he know about the child?
speaker1: he also thinks erik's the father.
speaker2: well that's good.
speaker1: everybody thinks erik's her father. erik probably thinks he's her father.
speaker2: crazy bastard. you got a fix on him yet?
speaker1: let's see what else knepfler has to offer.

speaker1: excuse me. you have to pay first. 
speaker2: how much?
speaker1: 3 euros for half an hour.
speaker2: how does it work?
speaker1: you've never used the internet?
speaker2: no.
speaker1: just type whatever it is you're looking for here.

speaker1: isaacs. 
speaker1: a public computer at a berlin internet cafe just did a web search for ã¢â€âœdna interfering sequenceã¢â€â.
speaker2: hanna?
speaker1: next they searched the name johanna zadek.
speaker3: marissa stops dead. looks at isaacs.
speaker2: she's not coming here.

speaker1: in german w/ english 
speaker2: excuse me. i'm looking for joanna zadek's house. can you help?
speaker3: in kurdish w/ english
speaker2: i don't speak german.

speaker1: you won't find anything. 
speaker1: marissa would have been much too careful for that.
speaker1: sit down hanna.
speaker2: are you my father?
speaker1: sit down.

speaker1: are you my father? 
speaker2: please.
speaker1: are you?
speaker2: i was going to tell you.
speaker1: what's wrong with me?
speaker2: nothing.
speaker1: where was i born?
speaker2: at galinka.
speaker1: what's that?
speaker2: it was a secret cia research programme in rural poland.
speaker1: what kind of research?
speaker2: children.
speaker2: it was run by marissa wiegler. the science came from the old east germany. the money from the cia. the intention was to explore whether small genetic changes could be made to embryos... to improve

speaker1: reduce capacity for fear. for pity. increase muscle strength. heighten senses. anything that might make a better soldier. 
speaker2: how did you know about it?
speaker1: i worked for it.
speaker1: this is what you were looking for.
speaker1: i recruited your mother at an abortion clinic in may 1994. she was about to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. some boy at a disco.
speaker1: i had recruited twenty women. she was the last. she was different. two years later i heard the programme was to be terminated. the research ã¢â€âœdisposed ofã¢â€â.
speaker2: disposed of?
speaker1: i tried to save all of you. but you were the only one i was able to rescue.

speaker1: hanna listen to me. 
speaker2: keep away from me.
speaker1: it worked. you worked.
speaker2: you mean i'm a killer?
speaker1: no... no..
speaker2: don't touch me.
speaker1: we have a new identity for you. a new life. a new beginning.
speaker1: don't.
speaker2: let me go.
speaker1: i tried to prepare you for what your life would be.
speaker2: you didn't prepare me for this.

speaker1: so go ahead. 
speaker2: you know i'll find her.
speaker1: don't under estimate what you created.
speaker2: what we created, together.

speaker1: they had a fight. 
speaker2: she must know the truth.
speaker1: where do you think she's gone?
speaker2: where would you go?
speaker2: i'm closing the cia operation down. heller is dead, that's all that matters to them. this we do alone.

speaker1: i am looking for a train to galinka. 
speaker2: galinka is a small village. no trains. you must wait for bus in the morning.
speaker1: where can i stay?

speaker1: do you have a sandwich? 
speaker2: kitchen is closed.
speaker3: get her something. poor girl's hungry.
speaker3: i'm from leipzig.
speaker3: you?

speaker1: the same. 
speaker2: business?
speaker2: where are you going?
speaker1: i am tired. i need to sleep.
speaker2: hello?
speaker2: i was just making nice conversation. yes?
speaker2: let's talk. maybe we can do business.
speaker2: you don't like talk, huh?
speaker2: be nice. be a nice little dolly.

speaker1: this is as far as the money gets you. 
speaker2: how much further?
speaker1: twelve miles.
speaker2: please.

speaker1: i'm going to galinka. can you help me? 
speaker2: yes i can take you there.

speaker1: it's a very dull place galinka. why would you want to go there? 
speaker2: i was born there. but i've never really seen it. why are you going?
speaker1: i have some business to sort out.

speaker1: it's very lucky we ran into each other, don't you think? 
speaker2: yes...
speaker1: you've hurt your arm.
speaker2: it's okay.
speaker1: i'm astrid.
speaker2: you're not german. are you american?
speaker1: that's right. i lived there for many years. i travel a lot.
speaker1: oh dear, what's wrong with you?
speaker2: sorry.
speaker1: it's okay. are you in trouble? hanna nods. she fights the tears.
speaker1: what sort of trouble?
speaker2: i don't know what to do. nothing is what i thought it would be. it's... ugly and cruel and i don't know where to go, or... i'm stupid. i don't know what i expected... marissa secretly, genuinely affected by this. fights the emotion that has surprised her. human warmth.
speaker1: sometimes i feel the same way.

speaker1: i like music. 
speaker2: sleep why don't you? you look very tired. it will take half an hour on this road.

speaker1: where are we? 
speaker2: nearly there.

speaker1: it's so small. 
speaker2: yes. just a few cottages. and the old bunker. hanna chooses not to ask any more questions.
speaker1: thank you for the ride. you're very kind.
speaker2: i wish there was more i could do for you.
speaker2: here, take this.
speaker2: i hope you find what you're looking for.
speaker1: thank you.

speaker1: at one end is a steep pile of metal bed frames. 
speaker2: happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...
speaker2: happy biirrrrthday, dear...
speaker2: ... hanna.

speaker1: you're marissa wiegler. hanna starts to shake. 
speaker2: don't worry sweetie. i don't want to hurt you.

speaker1: i could have killed you already when you were asleep in the car. hanna's still shaking. 
speaker1: did erik tell you about this place?
speaker2: where are the other children?
speaker1: sleeping. they're all sleeping.
speaker2: i don't believe you.
speaker1: i can protect you, hanna. make sure you walk out of here and keep walking. grow up and grow old in safety and security. no one need know a thing. but you have to trust me. you can't talk about this with anyone. it's what we call ã¢â€âœclassified.ã¢â€â if you tell anyone, it'll be dangerous for both of us.
speaker2: you killed my mother.
speaker1: you're mother didn't want you, sweetie. i saved you.
speaker1: i'm the only person left who understands who you are. the only one who cares.
speaker1: i practically am your mother.

speaker1: no more. no more. 
speaker1: everything i see is nothing i want.
speaker2: let me take care of you?
speaker1: no. i don't want that.
speaker2: hanna.

speaker1: the earth is the third planet from the sun, and the fifth-largest of the eight planets in the solar system. 
speaker1: home to millions of species, including humans, earth is the only place in the universe where life is known to exist.
speaker1: the planet formed over four and a half billion years ago, and life appeared on its surface within a billion years.
speaker1: it is expected to continue supporting life for another one and a half billion years, after which the rising luminosity of the sun will eliminate it all.
