speaker1: good morning. 
speaker1: wow, you look beautiful.
speaker2: what? no. i don't. oh my its the morning. i look terrible. i just woke up.
speaker1: last night was fun.
speaker2: yeah, i had the best time. i have't had that much fun on a first date in years, ever...
speaker1: so listen annie, i like you. so, i want to be up front with you. i'm not really looking for a relationship right now.
speaker2: oooooo. oops. i mean, yeah. what?
speaker1: i just want to be honest right off the bat.

speaker1: yeah, yeah. ok. yeah. yeah. i love that. annie struggles to maintain her composure. 
speaker2: i'm just so busy and i don't have time for another person...i...
speaker1: yeah, me too, i'm soo busy--
speaker2: and summer's coming--
speaker1: yeah, summer, exactly. it's a crazy season. so you just wanna give me a call in the fall or--?
speaker2: yeah, i'm not gonna be in town much even in the fall--
speaker1: you shouldn't be! yeah, halloween--
speaker2: i'm gonna be travelling a lot for work.
speaker1: me too, i'm just- so many business trips to places that are just far awayã¢â€â˜cause i'm doing really well at work.
speaker2: and honestly, i don't even know how i feel about the whole monogamy thing, is one person really enough for anyone? i mean, i like to be with a lot of different people.
speaker1: it is sooo refreshing to hear you say that, because isn't that what everyone thinks but is afraid to say? i mean, i's science. i'm-i don't want a relationship either. let's just say that. and i wouldn't even care whatever you do or i do, i just wanna have tons of fun, like no strings attached at all. i'm just different from other girls.

speaker1: yeah. well anyway, i really should get going. i was gonna get a haircut today. 
speaker2: yeah, they say that every couple months it's good to trim the ends, you know, get all the dead stuff. so, cool. cool. 've cut hair before.
speaker1: well, like i said i got stuff to do.
speaker2: yeah, me too. gonna try to get some sailing in before the weather gets crazy...

speaker1: oh, and thanks for the lemon bars. 
speaker2: oh, no problem. made from scratch.

speaker1: sometimes it sticks! 
speaker2: no, i love it!
speaker2: byyyyee!

speaker1: it's summer?! what the does that mean? he can't date anyone in the summer? 
speaker2: i guess? i don't know. i feel so stupid now.
speaker1: no he's stupid ann, not you.
speaker2: i think i might be a little bit stupid.
speaker1: ew. did you have with him?
speaker2: no! but i gave him a blow job.
speaker1: what?!
speaker2: well, he kept putting it in my face.

speaker1: well, at least he was honest with you so you don't waste your time with him. 
speaker2: baby, look how hard i worked out. look at all this sweat.
speaker1: can you see that i'm on the phone? i'm talking to annie.
speaker2: hey annie.
speaker1: are you eating my luna bar? those are for women you know?

speaker1: it's not gonna do anything to you.
speaker2: oh my my are getting bigger. he tries to rub up against lillian.
speaker1: ew, go take a shower.
speaker2: i'm gonna play with my new in there.
speaker1: i swear i cannot handle him right now. he has been driving me crazy. sometimes it feels like i'm kissing my brother. i don't know what do.
speaker3: at least you have someone. wha's wrong with me?

speaker1: there's nothing wrong with you. but i think maybe, and don't get mad at me, i've said this to you before, you need to stop trying so hard. 
speaker2: i still don't think i do that.
speaker1: ok, so you had a first date last night. did you bring him a present?
speaker1: ann, what did i tell you?
speaker2: i brought him lemon-bars because i was making them anyway, as a friend. yo're right, that's weird.
speaker3: 
speaker1: what?!
speaker3: i just chipped a nail!
speaker1: ok, i don't know if it's because i'm tired or what, but i wanna kill him.
speaker2: ok, just take a deep breath, look in the mirror and remember when i was getting my braces off and farted at the orthodontist. lillian laughs.
speaker1: oh my we need to hang out. 'm coming to milwaukee this weekend.
speaker2: are you serious?

speaker1: we'll go to joni's and pig out and i'll bring some magazines, and i'm gonna spend the night. 
speaker2: i haven't seen you in months!
speaker1: i'll call you tomorrow. bye.
speaker3: baby, i'm going through some changes...
speaker1: you're an

speaker1: hi. sorry, sorry! i'm here. i'm here. 
speaker2: annie! thank ok people! gather around me please, in a tight semicircle.
speaker2: something terrible has happened. donald will not be coming in to work today. he stepped on a wasp and there is some uncomfortable swelling.
speaker2: annie? where's your tie?

speaker1: now, i have an eye doctor's appointment that i can't change or they'll will charge me. so someone will have to cover for donald in engagement rings. now i-- 
speaker1: sandy? today's your day.
speaker2: ooh, my horoscope said i would be presented with an opportunity at work today. that is eerie. that is eerie.
speaker1: annie, that means you'll be alone in keepsakes. you think you can handle it?
speaker3: yeah, look out. there might be a bum- rush for letter openers...
speaker4: sometimes there is, so....there have been. at times, there has been.
speaker1: alright everybody, let's get to work! saneel?!...open sesame!
speaker4: donna, can i talk to you for a second? i feel like if you gave me a shot at engagement rings sometime, i could really-
speaker1: annie, what is the calibration of a 2 carat diamond in a standard english setting?
speaker4: five?

speaker1: i just made all of that up. none of that was real. i just put words together. you're not ready for the big leagues. understand? 
speaker2: it's so hard to make commission over there.
speaker1: sweetheart...did i ever tell you the story of the little paralyzed chinese girl who wanted to be dancer?
speaker2: many times.
speaker1: she was paralyzed annie, had no feeling in her legs, and then one day after years of believing in herself, she stood up out of that chair and tap-danced for the king. on his birthday! my point is, sandy makes a real effort around here. he connects with the customer. and when he wants to make a sale, he goes for it.
speaker2: okay. i do want it.
speaker1: good. showing up on time is a wonderful place to start.
speaker1: uhh! a wasp! who walks around even their own backyard without at least a thin sandal. it's reckless!
speaker2: hello, can i interest you in a sterling silver money clip that will create memories for you and your family? no?

speaker1: noooo. that's, that's sooo smart. 
speaker1: there you are, you stayer-out-all- nighter. did you make out? sleep over?
speaker1: don't go in the bathroom. are you going to bed?
speaker2: yes. i'm beat.
speaker1: your ex-boyfriend got more mail, i did what you said and just threw it away.
speaker2: thanks. goodnight steve!
speaker1: that credit lady called! she wants to talk to you, annie! she's gonna find you.
speaker3: this is where they bagged the animals that didn't make it through the testing. we turned it into a cozy moroccan reading room.

speaker2: it's beautiful. lillian. oh my this is...this is crazy!
speaker1: i know dougie and i have been fighting a lot, but i've been so stressed out with

speaker1: that's not i mean. i mean, i remember when we met him at lake mills. you lost your virginity to him right in front of me on the dock, remember? 
speaker2: oh you want to get into who's done what down at the lake?
speaker1: no, i don't. it's just making me realize how long we've known each other.
speaker2: well then, who better to be my maid of honor?
speaker1: oh my i don't know what to say!
speaker2: annie, you're my best friend. honestly i didn't even have to think about it.

speaker1: uh, wow. yes! of course! yes! my 
speaker2: it's no big deal, and i don't want to make it one. it's not gonna be a big crazy thing. i wanna keep it simple.
speaker1: i know what you're doing. don't downplay this. i'm happy for you. and someday when freezes over and i get married, you can be my maid of honor. but for right now, this is about you. ok? this is you're day, and it is a big deal.
speaker2: ok, but i still don't want this to be a huge production. i just want to have all my friends meet each other, have fun, dance, drink, whatever.
speaker1: then that's what it'll be. did you guys set a date?
speaker2: oh not yet. i don't want a super long engagement, but there's a lot to do.
speaker1: well you are very fortunate because you happen have the best maid of honor in the whole wide world, and--
speaker2: can you hold that thought. i's my fiancee calling.
speaker1: ooo, haha...

speaker1: well, some dogs are ugly. some girls are ugly. i know a lot of ugly girls. but i'm not friends with them. i've seen a lot of ugly dogs too. but some people i know who are considered dogs, you know, they have a good personality, and are better looking to people cuz of that. and people who are not nice...that's ugly to me. and female dogs are called bitches, that's weird. i'm just kidding. it's a joke. i have better ones.
speaker3: hello?!
speaker1: helen! sorry. yeah um, i'm really excited for all the wedding stuff and--

speaker1: ã¢â€âœi could fly higher then an eagle. for you are the wind beneath my wings. flyyy, flyyyyy, so fly into the sky, so fly until we touch up high--ã¢â€â
speaker2: lillian and annie are at the valet.
speaker1: oh my tell me i didn't sing.
speaker3: no, you sang.
speaker1: i don't know, i was just maybe a little out of my element, and after helen's speech--
speaker3: ann, stop.

speaker1: i'm so embarrassed. what did you think of your engagement party? 
speaker2: besides the impromptu concert from bette midler, it was perfect. they laugh and hug.
speaker2: i gotta go say bye to some people i do't know. drive safe.
speaker3: annie! great job tonight..
speaker1: i'm feeling slightly mortified.
speaker3: no, nononono. not at all. everyone gets a little nervous and carried away during those kind of things. so listen, 've been brainstorming some theme ideas for lillian's shower. i was thinking somewhere along the lines of alice in wonderland meets...are you ready? hollywood. and for the bachelorette? vegas.
speaker1: aren't i supposed to be planning some of these things?
speaker3: oh, well, i hadn't heard from you and--
speaker1: she just got engaged two weeks ago.
speaker3: well, i figured since you don't have any experience that you might get overwhelmed by events of this caliber.
speaker1: helen, i'm pretty capable. i think i can handle it. a guest walks by and taps helen.

speaker1: thank you. 
speaker1: annie, i didn't mean i didn't think you couldn't do it. i'm sure you are aware of all your duties. we'll see--we'll see you soon.
speaker2: you're very pretty.
speaker3: annie!
speaker3: annie wait! i wanna give you my numbers. a place just opened up near my house. from 4-7 every weekday, karaoke, two dollar wings and all you can eat man sandwiches if you know what i mean. annie is nervous, starts biting her nails.

speaker1: your nail too short for french manicure. 
speaker2: oh well...
speaker1: that's ok. i fix for you. make you sexy.
speaker2: oh, great!

speaker1: and then they put a solution in my eyes to dilate them, which caused temporary blindness and with the loss of my sight, my hearing became bionic. do you need some help dear? 
speaker2: no, i got it.

speaker1: sorry... well, it's official. lillian set a date. october tenth. why did i just get a stomach ache. 
speaker2: don't be nervous. it's not all on your shoulders. doesnt she have other bridesmaids?
speaker1: yeah and they've all done this before so i'm feeling a little pressure. i have to make this really nice for lillian.
speaker2: i wish i could help. weddings are a lot different now then they were in my day.
speaker1: that dress is beautiful.
speaker2: i still have it. i was hoping my daughter elizabeth would wear it but when she and alice had their ã¢â€âœceremonyã¢â€â they both wanted to wear suits. ok, we need two shannisburg tennis bracelets. annie struggles to write with her nails.
speaker1: oops. hold on a sec, hard to write...

speaker1: hi. i need to make these shorter. 
speaker2: no, not sexy!
speaker1: i know, it's... i can't work with them so long.
speaker2: okay. 7 dollar for file. no more though.
speaker1: ok.
speaker2: short nail is ugly.
speaker1: alright.

speaker1: here it is! 
speaker2: ooh, occasionz. i'm impressed.
speaker1: everyone this is occasionz, supposedly it's you know, one of the best bridal shops in town, so, that's cool. oh and also, there's a restaurant inside, so um, i figured, we could maybe have lunch after. so, let's go!

speaker1: oh, i didn't see that. 
speaker2: hello?
speaker1: hi, we're hear to see some bridesmaids dresses.
speaker2: what's your name?
speaker1: oh, annie.
speaker2: what's the reservation name?
speaker1: oh, she must be talking about the restaurant. no, we're here to look at dresses.
speaker2: i heard you the first time. so i take it you don't have a reservation for the dress shop?
speaker3: you didn't make a reservation?
speaker1: um, no, i'm sorry, i didn't know i had to make a reservation for that. sorry! anyway, we're all out here now and--
speaker2: the next available appointment for bridesmaid fittings is in seven weeks and we don't take reservations over the intercom so you'll have to call.
speaker1: seven weeks?!
speaker2: i'm sorry maybe you can't hear me. i just said a few seconds ago that we do't have a reservation for the next seven weeks.

speaker1: and when you make your reservation do't forget you'll also need to make an appointment. 
speaker2: what?
speaker3: you didn't make an appointment?

speaker1: no, i can hear you. would it be possible for you to make an exception for us because we drove all the way out here and i didn't know about the reservation/ appointment thing so... 
speaker2: hold on.
speaker3: annie, we can go somewhere else.
speaker1: no, no. i'll work it out. don't worry.
speaker4: this really is the best place though, that's the thing.
speaker5: listen, i know the--
speaker1: yes, hello!
speaker6: we can fit you in seven weeks, that is all we have available. we only take parties that have a reservation and that have made an appointment over the phone. i'm going to ask you to not buzz in again. thank you. byyyyyyye.

speaker1: whitney? 
speaker2: yes? who is this?
speaker1: whit, it's helen.
speaker2: helen?! hiiii!
speaker1: hiiii!
speaker2: hi!
speaker1: hi! listen, i'm out here with a whole bunch of girls and we had a little miscommunication and our reservation- appointment wasn't made. is there any way to fit us in?
speaker2: say no more.

speaker1: ann, don't worry about it. we got in. 
speaker2: hey, you want to sneak off and look at the wedding dresses?
speaker1: oh my annie, i didn't tell you? guess who helen is friends with? lady lavonia jean st. petsois juju.

speaker1: that famous wedding dress designer tha's in all those wedding magazines? as a favor to helen she's going to design my dress for almost nothing. normally they're like twenty grand. she's french. 
speaker2: wow. that's amazing.

speaker1: surprise, surprise. it's my mom. mom? can you hold on a second? she covers the phone and talks to the girls. 
speaker1: start looking at dresses. i'll be right back. i think maybe you guys should decide anyway and pick out something you like since you're the ones wearing it. cool? have fun! what's up mom? ugh! they're booked?
speaker2: ok ladies, start your engines!

speaker1: well, with that dress on you look about... .eleven. 
speaker2: thank you.
speaker3: excuse me, you dropped an earring.
speaker4: i'll get it for her.
speaker5: no i will!
speaker6: i'll get it! i'm a lifeguard.
speaker2: hi.
speaker7: hi. i'm christian bale. i'm just chopping some wood, i like to do that between movies.
speaker2: hello christian.

speaker1: oh, christian! i need a place to hide. 
speaker2: quick, get inside my muscles.
speaker2: i love this sash.
speaker3: hi annie!

speaker1: look at your cute little boobies. ooh, is that the dress you like? 
speaker2: yeah. i think it will look good on everybody, it has a sash--
speaker1: a sash? annie, this isn't the sound of music tryouts.
speaker2: huh?
speaker3: i told you becca i can't wear strapless!
speaker4: why not?!
speaker3: because, i--

speaker1: why don't you two shut your traps? no one's going to be looking at us. le's just get the one with the shawl, 'm always freezing at these things anyway. 
speaker2: i gotta say i'm still leaning towards the one that i found. it is a very ugly.
speaker1: absolutely not.
speaker3: well, what about this one?
speaker3: i think it would be flattering on everyone and we could totally wear it again. the sash comes in different colors not just this one.
speaker4: everyone! we can't all have the dress that we want. i've been in a lot of weddings and when choosing a bridesmaid dress, you must ask yourself, ã¢â€âœif invited, would i wear this a dress to...the academy awards!ã¢â€â
speaker5: ooo, i never thought of it that way.
speaker4: with that in mind, i say we wear this one.
speaker3: or this one! people wear sashes to the academy awards all the time.
speaker4: only if they're nominated for the sound of music.

speaker1: i think lillian would like this one. 
speaker2: well, i think lillian would like this one.
speaker3: hey! i'm hearing lots of excitement in here.
speaker3: oooo, i like this one. what about you guys?
speaker2: i love it. right guys?
speaker3: cool. let's eat!
speaker2: i think it might look best in cream.
speaker3: ooh, good idea.
speaker4: well, that was easy.
speaker1: this dress is almost $500!
speaker5: that's not too bad/that sounds about right.
speaker1: no, that's what i'm saying. that's a great price.

speaker1: this place is kind of amazing. i did't even know it existed. 
speaker2: the southwestern cobb is really good. i come here and eat sometimes.
speaker3: great, there's a fly that really likes me.
speaker4: they only have salads.
speaker5: so annie, what's your deal? are you dating anyone?
speaker4: no, no. not right now. i had a boyfriend for three years but we broke up like six months ago.
speaker2: oh, i hate to hear stuff like that! what happened?
speaker4: it just didn't work out.
speaker6: is that the guy who stole a bunch of money from you and gave you an std?
speaker6: lillian told me.
speaker1: i'm sorry, i was just talking about you cause i was worried about you and--

speaker1: no it's fine. but he didn't steal the money, i loaned it to him. and hpv is really common right now. 
speaker1: around fifty percent of sexually active men and women acquire hpv at some point in their lives and by age fifty, eighty percent of women will be infected with a genital hpv infection.
speaker2: really?
speaker1: about 6.2 million new cases of hpv affect americans each year.
speaker3: ew, it's on the butter you guys. the fly's on the butter.
speaker4: well, i don't have it.
speaker1: very few hpv infections show any signs or symptoms. therefore a lot of infected people don't even know they have it, yet they transmit the virus to their sexual partner. silent. everyone is a little grossed out..
speaker1: anyway, it's fine, the past is the past. we weren't meant to be. my last pap-smear came back normal so that's cule. but you know, i'm dating, here and there...
speaker4: do you have anyone in mind to bring to the wedding?
speaker1: oh, i didn't even think about that.
speaker2: who needs a date? just go stag and make out with someone there.

speaker1: if you wanna meet a nice man, annie, you should come to karaoke night at my church. we sing hymns to rock beats! 
speaker2: wait. i have the perfect guy for you annie. mike donahue. he went to school with kevin.
speaker3: mike from the fourth of july last year?
speaker4: really?
speaker2: and kevin said he just sold his company for an embarrassing amount of money. but he's totally down to earth. you guys have to meet. i'm texting kevin right now.
speaker5: i know mike too.
speaker6: the fly just committed suicide. death by butter.
speaker1: oh my gosh, if you guys got married you could live out here and see us all the time!
speaker7: yeah, and then pop out a couple kids, sit around and talk about nothing while your flaps in the wind like a wet paper towel.
speaker5: oooh, i didn't know we were going to hear that word at lunch today.
speaker1: i was set up with ernie. as soon as i met him, i knew.
speaker3: yeah annie, you never know.

speaker1: yes. 
speaker1: what?! come on!
speaker2: well, look who it is.
speaker1: oh hi.
speaker2: i see your still driving around with busted tail lights.
speaker1: i'm sorry, money's been tight and...i forgot. you're not gonna give me another ticket for that are you?
speaker2: nah... the reason i pulled you over today, is that-- you were driving too slow. backing up traffic.
speaker1: i was?
speaker2: yep. you were going ten miles under the speed limit. that's a moving violation. it's...underdriving. it's in the books. but, i'm just going to give you a warning this time, but i do have to um...write some stuff down on a piece of paper.
speaker2: man i'm hungry. i'm doing the master cleanse. you ever heard of it?
speaker1: yeah.

speaker1: cayenne pepper water for three days now. it's supposed to clean you out, make you feel lighter. it's working. the only problem is i get so hungry. i just want a big slab of ribs. you ever crave that kind of stuff? 
speaker2: don't talk about cravings right now. i am pms'ing like crazy. it's taking everything in me not to stop and the store and get like three kit-kats and a bottle of wine. i'm so irritable right now. they stare at each other out of awkwardness.
speaker2: sorry.
speaker1: no, it's ok, i've got three sisters. we had tampons in the pencil drawer. sometimes my friends and i would say they were cigars and smoke'em. okay. i have finished writing down the things i need to write, on this paper. oh!
speaker1: this is a buddy of mine. owns a body shop in milwaukee. might be able to help you out for a good price with those taillights. i'll write my name on here so you can tell him who referred you.
speaker2: thanks.
speaker1: that's my name right there. in case you forgot it from last time. it's nathan rhodes.
speaker2: thanks. annie. i'll get those fixed. i get paid next week. bye!

speaker1: trust me, i've been in the jewelry business for a long time. nothing says ã¢â€âœi'm sorry for your loss' like a sterling silver money clip. 
speaker1: we also have yo-yos you can engrave. in memory of...um, what's your friend's name?
speaker2: paychecks. here you go annie.
speaker2: oh my i scored this week. 'm gonna buy sharita a new panasonic telephone. it's cordless and has intercom. what about you annie?
speaker1: i'm gonna pay for a cream-colored gown that i'll never wear again.

speaker1: help me! i can't find anything to wear for my date with mike tonight. 
speaker2: i don't know. shoot, i can't talk now. i'm with helen and we have a conference call with lady lavonia jean st. petsois juju about my dress. ugh. i'm so sorry. she's calling! i gotta go. have fun!

speaker1: that credit lady called you again. i told her you were at the tailors. 
speaker2: listen, i'm going on a date. this? or this?
speaker1: i don't like those pants.
speaker2: what's wrong with'em?
speaker1: they give you four corners.
speaker1: it's when a girls looks like it has four corners. it's not a good thing.
speaker2: these are my only clean pants.
speaker1: do you have a tube skirt?
speaker2: thanks steve.
speaker1: wait. if you stand like you are right now facing that angle, it looks good.

speaker1: i have to admit, i told becca 'm not really keen on set-ups. i know i's early, but so far so good. 
speaker2: me too.
speaker1: and thanks again for coming from milwaukee, i know it's quite a drive.
speaker2: i can do that drive in my sleep these days.
speaker1: next time maybe i'll come to you.
speaker1: you have got great teeth.
speaker2: thank you. i brush'em every day. she flashes her teeth. the hostess comes up.
speaker3: your tables ready.
speaker1: finally!
speaker1: well, i don't know about you but since we're at a thai restaurant, i'm gonna try the dog.
speaker2: so, becca tells me you play a lot of tennis.
speaker1: i try to squeeze in a game now and then. we should play sometime.

speaker1: oh, yeah i haven't rea-- 
speaker2: yeah, my game's pretty solid. i did win a couple tournaments at the club. i tend to- christ! it smells like b.o. in here huh? i think it's the people.
speaker3: here ya go. i'll be back to take your order in two secs. i'm swamped!
speaker1: no problem.
speaker2: whoa, get a load of our waiter. 'm surprised he didn't put pink umbrellas in our drinks...
speaker2: or aids.
speaker2: seriously, aids is crazy. you do't have it do you?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: neither do i...

speaker1: so i started to get a little chub, you know what that is. how could i not with those huge canteloupes waving in my face. anyway, i looovee massages, am i right? 
speaker1: whoa-ho! excyuuuuse me! i got that from steve martin. still laughing, he pats his pockets.
speaker1: oh i forgot my wallet.

speaker1: hey, it's me, i just had to tell you about my night. oh my call me. 
speaker2: annie walker. i thought i heard your car out there.
speaker1: very funny, officer...jones?
speaker2: jones? oh boy. guess somebody thought he was a little more memorable than he was.
speaker1: no. sorry. i'm a little out of it. i'm not drunk.
speaker2: that's ok. call me rhodes. trying to get ã¢â€âœcalmã¢â€â?

speaker1: yeah. recovering from a date. 
speaker2: oh.
speaker1: finish your cleanse?
speaker2: yeah, trying to wean myself back to the really bad foods i like eating.

speaker1: thanks for the drink. so are you one of those cops that sits in that same spot everyday and sneaks up on people? 
speaker2: a lot of people get up to high speeds on this road. i tell people its better to pay for a ticket than have your family pay for a funeral.
speaker1: that's a very good point.
speaker3: want a carrot?
speaker1: yes. i'm starving.

speaker1: ew! what is this? 
speaker2: oh, you got the ugly carrot.
speaker1: the what?

speaker1: there's one in every bag. you should eat it. 
speaker2: no. i think you should eat it. the're your carrots.
speaker2: no, no! don't eat it! ew!!!
speaker1: don't litter.

speaker1: i don't think i've ever wanted to get of out a restaurant faster in my life. 
speaker2: yeah, i don't go on blind dates. it seems unnatural.
speaker1: i have no idea what am i going to tell my friends who set us up.
speaker2: just tell her the truth.
speaker1: yeah. you're probably right.
speaker1: it's an ok job. it's commission, so it's unpredictable. i don't know, i always wanted to finish my bachelor's but that's kind of financially impossible right now. plus i'd feel like ninety around all those college students.

speaker1: you know my dad used to say that life is like a hallway of doors. you can stand at the same door forever if you want. or you can open a different door. and that one may not be the right door, but i'll open up a whole new hallway of doors. anyway, it worked for me. i was kinda lost and i opened a door and the next thing i knew i was a cop. and i love my job. 
speaker2: hmm. i think i get it?
speaker1: or you can always sell moon-pies by the side of the road.
speaker2: moonpies. what?
speaker1: it's a joke. you had moon-pies in your car the first time i pulled you over.
speaker2: oh yeah.
speaker3: when i get married i don't want the kind of wedding people have these days. i want it to be like a carnival. you know dunk tanks? people win prizes...
speaker2: yeah, and you can have elephants, trapeze artists and a big scale to guess the bride's weight.
speaker3: ok, first of all that's a circus wedding and i'm talking about a carnival wedding.

speaker1: and then she moved to hawaii and now lives with a guy who sells shaved ice. and supposedly she has really long armpit hair now. that's pretty much the last girlfriend i had. 
speaker2: well, lets just say my last boyfriend that i lived with broke up with me over the phone. then come to find out, he had borrowed $30,000 in my name without telling me, putting me in horrible debt that i'm still paying off. because i can't find him.
speaker1: wow. you win.
speaker3: annie in her car, engine running.
speaker2: oh my gosh. it's twelve thirty! i should probably...
speaker4: oh, before you go. there is something i want to give you. i was gonna wait but, i think you'll want this now.
speaker2: for me?!
speaker1: well i know you've had a terrible night. he gives it to her. her phone rings.

speaker1: sorry, one sec. hello? ted!? hey! oh my gosh! no,no. can you hold on a sec? 
speaker1: i guess i'll see you around?
speaker2: yeah. don't forget about those taillights. they're really starting to bug me.
speaker1: k. bye. so, you're in town?
speaker3: he opens the front door, leading annie out again.
speaker4: next time i won't call so late.
speaker1: no, it was fine. like i said, i mean i was just driving.
speaker4: awesome. it's cool that we can just hookup and whatever. no strings.
speaker1: me too. i love it. i feel good right now.
speaker4: cool. bye.

speaker1: annie, hi! i almost left, but they said that you were coming and that you were late. 
speaker1: i had to come into milwaukee for a charity luncheon right down the street and i thought i'd come in and say hi.
speaker2: hi!
speaker1: and as the leader of the bridesmaids, i thought it'd be fun to pick up some little gifts for all the girls.
speaker2: leader of the bridesmaids? um, wouldn't that technically be me? honor?
speaker1: well, no, sweetie, you're the maid of honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out of all of us, i'm the leader. anyway, it doesn't matter. um, i wanted to get something that we could wear to the rehearsal dinner or something. that would be fun. where are the diamonds?
speaker2: oh, well, what about a nice pen..or a tortoise-shell handled sterling silver letter opener? no? ok, let me get sandy.
speaker1: oh! and annie we really need to start planning the bachelorette.

speaker1: yes. yes. i'm on it. got some ideas. so i'll let you know. 
speaker2: can't wait.

speaker1: wow, well i have never seen a transformation like this. this old tour bus is stunning. 
speaker2: thanks.
speaker3: unbelievable. you got another package from your mom.
speaker4: hey thanks for saving my today. like i said i'll pay you back as soon as i can.
speaker3: no problem. but you should always put gas in when it gets to a quarter tank. especially cause you have such a car.
speaker4: thanks. can i ask you a question? what do you think of vegas?
speaker3: ooo. let me turn this off. vegas is a black hole but i must have it in my life.
speaker4: i'm just asking because some of the girls are talking about going for lillia's bachelorette party and i've never been.

speaker1: oh no. now i don't know about weddings. when you go on a bachelorette, does the bride pay? 
speaker2: no, everyone pays for themselves. and you pay for the bride.
speaker1: ok, i'm gonna say no. you cannot afford that. vegas is not cheap. airfare, hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show tickets. remember this morning? you cannot afford vegas.
speaker2: well, i could save up for it.
speaker1: no, you need to win a contest to go to vegas/you had gum for lunch yesterday. ooh, ã¢â€âœnight moves.ã¢â€â can i have this?
speaker2: told you i'd pay you back!
speaker2: hello?
speaker3: hi.
speaker2: hi.
speaker3: hiiiii.

speaker1: hi helen. 
speaker2: i just got your e-mail. um...sea world?
speaker1: well it's not just sea world. it's a weekend in florida. see, when lillian and i were kids we went there and she loved it and has always talked about going back. ask dougie. i think it would really mean a lot to her. we could stay at my dad's house, he won't even be there. then we could go out at night and got to the beach and then sea world on one of the days.
speaker2: but a bachelorette at sea world?
speaker1: like i said, sea world would just be a part of it.
speaker2: well, i have been talking to the other girls, and i was thinking we should go to las vegas!
speaker1: oh, can you hold on? that's my other line.
speaker1: hello?
speaker3: hi, annie. it's becca.

speaker1: i was just looking at your e-mail, yo're so cute. sea world. what about turkey? that's where we went for for my bachelorette. 
speaker2: oh well, turkey's really far away.
speaker1: it's super old though! they have awesome restaurants. it's very exotic. have you ever seen aladdin? it totally looks like that.
speaker2: hang on...
speaker2: helen, i'm sorry can i call you back?
speaker3: when?
speaker2: just a few minutes. i'll call you back.
speaker2: becca?
speaker1: hi. you know, if you wanna go some place closer than turkey. helen just e-mailed me about going to vegas.
speaker2: oh, i don't know. everybody always goes to vegas. it seems just cliche to me.
speaker1: i never get sick of it. i love blackjack. i have a system. annie's other line.
speaker2: oh, my other line's ringing. can i call you back?

speaker1: when? 
speaker2: soon.
speaker2: hello?
speaker3: annie, it's dana!
speaker2: of course it is..
speaker3: i love your idea about sea world.
speaker2: really?
speaker3: yeah, but then helen just called me and said we should go to vegas.
speaker2: but vegas is so hot, don't you think? it's like, hot and dry. people get sick there all the time.
speaker3: i haven't had that experience. my skin always clears up there.
speaker2: yeah, i just think it's probably not-- hold on. hello?
speaker4: annie, it's megan.

speaker1: i can't talk right now, but i was thinking for the bachelorette, something more along the lines of a personal challenge weekend. have you ever heard of the nevada project? 
speaker2: no.
speaker3: i gotta be honest. i've been married for nine years, this may be the last bachelorette party of my career and i want the sweaty nuggets of a gay man pounding me in the face at some point during this trip. i'll pay whatever i have to pay. tyler stop it, put that back! paul!

speaker1: vegas has these party busses that have flat screens in them and dance floors-- 
speaker2: or we could take hummer limos around everywhere.
speaker3: that sounds really expensive.
speaker4: oh but it's gonna be so much fun! besides money shouldn't be a problem if lillian's our friend.
speaker3: oh no, no, i was just thinking about everyone else. that's all i'm saying.
speaker5: what i'm saying is, they drop you off in the middle of the desert. you have to kill your own food and find your way back. not everyone makes it. seriously.

speaker1: seriously. i want in my face. 
speaker2: so i think vegas is a good idea.
speaker3: i agree with helen. vegas.
speaker4: oh, you know what else is in nevada?
speaker1: balls. vegas.
speaker5: vegas it is.
speaker6: holy annie! we're goin' to vegas!

speaker1: no can do, i need all my shifts. 'm trying to save up and take my lady to maui. 
speaker2: please, one day a week, just for a little while. i've already asked everybody else. i really need the money.
speaker1: sorry. my hands are tied. sharita's got my in a chip-clip.
speaker2: that's alright. i understand.
speaker1: mmm. mm. these are the best peanut butter you ever made.
speaker2: they're called peanut butter kisses.
speaker1: that's not what they look like.

speaker1: here we are. the city of lust. annie, do you know how many men are looking for trouble in this town right now? we are gonna nail it down. we should tell everybody we're twins cause guys looking up with twins! 
speaker2: yeah, i've heard that. ok everybody! you guys, hey we're here, we're in vegas! woo! lillian walks up.
speaker3: annie, come here. why didn't you tell me you weren't sitting with us?
speaker2: oh, it's no big deal. i didn't want to blow all my money on a first class ticket. i'm here though, right?!
speaker3: i'm so excited!
speaker2: ok, you guys, gather around. welcome to lillian's bachelorette party! we should probably get a bunch of cabs and head to our beautiful hotel, the new marquis royal suites...
speaker4: lillian, look what's happening.

speaker1: oh my you guys, is this for us?! 
speaker2: i got a limo from the hotel. we're in vegas! yaaaay!!
speaker3: ok, everyone just get in the car. got a ride to the hotel. it's taken care of.

speaker2: annie, i didn't get a chance to ask you, how was your date with mike? give me all the details.
speaker6: oh, um, we had dinner.
speaker2: do you think you'll go out with him again? he told kevin he thought you were really great and hot.

speaker1: hey wha's the damage down there? 
speaker2: oh, i got it right here, i figured out what i owe so, should i just pass it around?
speaker1: why don't we just all split it? it's so much easier.
speaker3: yeah/just split it/who cares?
speaker2: yeah, it's probably just easier...just split it.
speaker4: here, let me see it. ok.. .it's a hundred each plus tip.
speaker2: i had soup and ice water.
speaker4: plus we're paying for lillian...everyone just put $125.
speaker2: no alcohol...or any real food.
speaker5: it'll all even out by the end of the night.
speaker2: how does it even out? how does that happen?
speaker6: thank you everybody!!
speaker7: annie, don't tell lillian, it's a surprise.

speaker1: my friend sean michael works for a promotional company and they're having this big event tonight at tara rei's stepbrother's club, sacrifice.

speaker2: i thought we were going to the jungle lounge after this.
speaker1: we are. after that.
speaker2: oh...um...wow. awesome. here's the thing i was going to stop by the hotel, the marquis suites. i think i ate something weird on the plane probably, my stomac's not right.
speaker1: oh, well we're only gonna be there for an hour or so, you can just meet up with us after.

speaker1: i'm selfish? you're the one that's been so wrapped up in all this. designer dressed, extravagant hotels, this shower, this is not you!
speaker2: this is my wedding and you've made it all about you.

speaker1: well at least my friendship's not for sale. 
speaker2: do you think she still has body lice?
speaker3: anyone else?! anyone else have something they wanna say to me?! dana can't contain herself.
speaker4: i got my chin done!
speaker5: kevin smokes pot!
speaker6: i'm pregnant!
speaker7: i took two dogs already. there in the back of my van!

speaker1: rhodes is looking under her hood. 
speaker2: well, i can't say i'm surprised.
speaker3: yes. taillights. i know!
speaker2: you should've taken it to my friend-
speaker3: i know! yes, you're friend! but i didn't ok?! i didn't get them fixed! i don't--
speaker2: whoa. don't take it out on me. this is your fault.
speaker3: he hit me!
speaker2: you had no taillights! you did't get them fixed! you don't get to blame anyoe else. it's your fault.
speaker2: where you going?!
speaker2: oh, you're going to walk fifteen miles?! another wise decision!
speaker3: what do you know?!!
speaker2: i know that you not taking responsibility is why we're standing out here! you did not make an effort to fix that problem.

speaker1: why are you yelling at me?! 
speaker2: it's dangerous! you're putting your life, and others in danger!
speaker1: i'm! sorry!
speaker2: look, all i know, is that you're kinda crazy. you're always stressed out or late, complaining about something, and now you're yelling at me! and for some reason, all i've ever wanted to do is ask you on a date.
speaker1: well save yourself the trouble, and don't.
speaker2: yeah, i'm not much of a hickey guy anyway.
speaker1: well, i have said ã¢â€âœnoã¢â€â anyway.
speaker2: well, then you have yourself a good night ma'am.

speaker1: rhodes told me a while back you might be stopping in. i'm bill cozbi. 
speaker2: oh, hi.
speaker1: i was beginning to think we'd never see ya.
speaker2: yeah, i know. i'm irresponsible.
speaker1: nah, no one likes taking care of that stuff. but you are going to have to leave your car here for a week or so.
speaker2: a week?

speaker1: so you kind of had a bad time at the wedding shower? 
speaker2: yes i did. everything's just...
speaker2: i'm sorry, i just--this has been a really day.
speaker1: yeah. ok, don't get mad at me, but it seems like you have a lot of those.
speaker2: yes i do! right? thank you.

speaker1: have you considered the idea that maybe, possibly, perhaps, it's you that makes them shitty? annie stares at him. 
speaker1: i'm just saying, maybe it's your attitude.
speaker2: this is not about attitude. it's just the facts! my life hasn't turned it out the way i expected. i don't have any of those things that gives a person points in the world.
speaker1: i think that might be your problem. i think you read too many of those magazines. you don't need things to be someone. tyra said that. tyra banks.

speaker1: is anyone sitting here? 
speaker2: no.

speaker1: hey annie. 
speaker2: oh, hey ted. you're in town.
speaker1: yeah, yeah. listen i'm going out tonight but i should be home around 11, you wanna come over?
speaker2: really? ok, sure.
speaker2: wait no. no. no. i don't think i do. because answering your booty calls and having you kick me out after a night of no-strings-attached doesn't feel good. no girls feel good after that and if they say they do they're lying. but it's not your fault. its me. it's me. have a great life. and you can keep the plant.

speaker1: annie sadly hangs up. 
speaker2: well, i can't think of anything else to tell you. did you have any questions?
speaker3: no, i think we've covered everything. i'm really excited and thank you. annie gathers her things.
speaker3: i'll see you next monday. what time do i start?
speaker2: four a.m.
speaker2: you'll get used to it.
speaker3: i won't be late.
speaker2: oh and i wanna try one of those moonpies.

speaker1: hi, i'm here to inquire about financial aid. 
speaker2: take these to the second window.
speaker1: i'm sorry?
speaker2: the second window.
speaker1: thanks.

speaker1: parts and labor, we're lookin' at eight hundred dollars. but with your discount... 
speaker2: discount?
speaker3: yeah. rhodes and i worked out a deal way back when, so, this one's on the house.
speaker2: are you serious?
speaker1: yep. i owe him big time. he runs background checks on all the guys my daughter dates. there's been a lot of 'em.

speaker1: ok, you can take women's studies or spanish...oooh the history of wine. 
speaker2: hello?
speaker3: annie. it's megan, becca leslie, dana and helen.
speaker2: oh. hi--

speaker1: what do you mean she's missing? 
speaker2: we were all supposed to get spray-tans today and she never showed up. no on's heard from her. she could be anywhere, doing anything! she could be anywhere--
speaker3: christ, give me the phone. leslie grabs the phone from megan.
speaker3: annie, it's leslie. look, i'm sure it's nothing to worry about. the weddin's the day after tomorrow, she's been really stressed, so she just probably freaked out and went somewhere. we just want to find her and probably talk her off a ledge. any ideas?
speaker1: um, gosh i..i don't know. um, i'll come to you guys. i'll be there in an hour and 45 minutes. i wanna help.
speaker4: what about the science of jazz?

speaker1: maybe she's at the park. 
speaker2: the park? don't be stupid dana.
speaker3: jeez, take it easy.

speaker1: well, it's closed is all i'm just saying. 
speaker2: maybe she flew somewhere. everyone always hides in mexico.
speaker3: i don't think she'd leave the country.
speaker1: why would she go to the reservoir? its just a big tank of water.
speaker4: ernie and i sometimes go for our morning walk there. it's the next best thing to a lake.
speaker5: oh my i think i know where she is.
speaker6: how much further?
speaker5: we're almost there.
speaker3: i'm think i'm getting carsick.
speaker1: is that supposed to be a dig on my driving?
speaker4: well you do speed up and slow down a lot.
speaker1: oh, i'm sorry. i didn't take a stunt driving course in renegade missions.
speaker3: why do you always have to be so condescending?

speaker1: yeah, its getting really old. 
speaker2: i was being funny!
speaker3: well it came out a little mean helen.
speaker2: dana who's side are you on?
speaker4: what was that?
speaker3: did we hit something!?
speaker2: was it a person?
speaker5: guys it's just a flat. i've gotten tons of them.
speaker6: no!/ annie don't get out!/ it's pitch dark out.
speaker2: everybody calm down. i'm calling 911.
speaker1: you don't call 911 for a flat tire!
speaker5: guys! we're fine. helen, put the hazards on. helen puts them on.

speaker1: i'm calling aaa. 
speaker2: i'm calling kevin!
speaker3: helen, do you have a jack?
speaker4: probably?!
speaker5: what if we get hit just sitting here? or kidnapped or chased by an animal?
speaker3: dana calm down.
speaker1: i don't have any service.
speaker2: me neither!
speaker5: oh my we're gonna die... annie has had enough and gets out.

speaker1: everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. 
speaker2: so, how can i help?
speaker1: hold the flashlight.

speaker1: megan hand me the wrench. 
speaker2: that's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire.
speaker3: i know. i can't believe she's doing it.
speaker4: just don't scratch anything.
speaker2: so what are you doing now?
speaker1: i'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off.
speaker3: how does that little thing lift the whole car?
speaker5: it uses hydraulic power. it gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons.
speaker6: how do you know this stuff?
speaker5: i like cars. there's a real artistry to them.
speaker4: are you guys working or talking? we do't have all night.
speaker2: annie is doing the best she can helen. so why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait.
speaker7: everyone's speechless.
speaker4: excuse me?!
speaker2: i said, will you, for once, shut the up!!!??
speaker2: lillian probably left because of you anyway.
speaker4: what!?
speaker2: you're so- bossy! you've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? you know, lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! she said ã¢â€âœthat's not me.ã¢â€â and you ordered it anyway! you've been pushing her this whole time! annie was right.
speaker5: yeah!
speaker4: what are you talking about? the only reason you're even in this wedding is because you're the groom's sister.
speaker5: i'd rather be the groom's sister than have cameltoe from my $600 pants.
speaker4: why is everyone attacking me? i wasn't the one who caused a huge scene at lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.
speaker8: everyone looks at annie.
speaker6: i hate to interrupt this riveting discussion but a really creepy guy in a trans am just pulled over.
speaker9: hey it's pretty late. what are you ladies doing?
speaker1: just changing the tire.
speaker9: you guys need some man hands for that?
speaker1: nope i think we got it. but thank you.
speaker9: look, if you guys get tired, i live right up that hill. you ladies can just leave your car here, come on up and let us all lay down together.
speaker5: hey! are those snowflake rims?
speaker9: yeah, found ã¢â€â˜em in a junk yard. restored ã¢â€â˜em myself.
speaker5: i bet you got a formula 4oo under there?
speaker9: well, well. someone knows her cars.

speaker1: i'm in the firebird club. 
speaker2: you don't say. i never met a lady in the fbc before.
speaker1: you ever make it up to the trans am nationals in dayton?
speaker3: what's happening? what's happening?
speaker4: i can hear animals.
speaker3: be quiet!
speaker1: remember smokey and the bandit?
speaker2: it's my favorite movie. ã¢â€âœgive me a diablo sandwich and a dr. pepper and make it quick . i'm in a hurry.ã¢â€â he leans into her.
speaker1: why don't you show me what's under the hood?
speaker5: how's it comin'?
speaker6: almost there.

speaker1: you wanna get in the backseat? 
speaker2: uh...
speaker2: hey take it easy!
speaker3: hey what about me?
speaker4: oh my
speaker5: ok, everybody in the car! get in! megan, helen let's go!
speaker1: hey you!
speaker3: annie get in!
speaker1: i'm gonna get you bitches!!
speaker5: back away! or i will shove this jack so far down your throat you will out...your fucking..face!
speaker1: whoa, whoa. alright. alright. i'm leaving.
speaker5: get out!

speaker1: i am! i live up the hill though if you change your mind. 
speaker2: the girls still driving. megan's eating chips.
speaker3: megan i was freaked out when he leaned up against you. that was a pretty gutsy move.
speaker4: annie's the one who tried to make him eat a car jack.
speaker5: helen hit him over the head with a tree.
speaker5: there it is, turn left up here. go down the little hill. ok, that's the driveway.
speaker3: i haven't been here in forever.
speaker5: the house is right up here.
speaker6: her car's not here.
speaker7: doesn't look like any lights are on.
speaker8: she's not here.

speaker1: i thought she'd be here. i really thought she'd be here. i'm sorry. 
speaker2: annie, it's ok.
speaker1: no, it's not. i don't know what happened. i messed everything up. lillia's not even talking to me. i think i'm so afraid to see what's really happening. lillian's moving on to this great life and i feel left behind. and know matter how hard i try, i don't fit in to her life now. everyone is silent.
speaker1: lillian wouldn't do that. if she asked you to be in her wedding it's because you are her friend. trust me.
speaker3: i'm sorry about the sea world tickets.
speaker1: i'm sorry that when i left the shower i told your neighbors you were shooting a porn.

speaker1: oh, i didn't know that you did that. 
speaker2: oh, well, sorry.
speaker1: i deserved it.
speaker2: i must say you do put on some pretty spectacular events.
speaker1: well, i'm really rich.
speaker2: it is getting pretty late.
speaker3: what should we do about lillian?
speaker2: she'll come home when she's ready.

speaker1: you okay? 
speaker2: yeah. didn't mean to make anyone worry.
speaker1: it's okay. i really am sorry.
speaker2: i'm sorry too. i didnt want things to turn out like this. i got so caught up in the frenzy of everything, wanting this one day to be perfect.
speaker1: well its easy to get caught up.

speaker1: and it doesnt help that all my friends hate eachother. 
speaker2: i'm sorry. but it's all good now. we all talked and everythings cool.
speaker3: really?!
speaker2: yup, helen and i are best friends now. we're going shopping for cream sweaters tomorrow.
speaker1: she's really not so bad.
speaker2: i know.
speaker1: i just wish the wedding hadnt become about everything and everyone else but me and dougie. and now, it's become this thing i never wanted. i did want simple. i wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights and food everywhere. i wanted a dj to play all those stupid wedding songs.
speaker2: it's not too late to have those things.
speaker1: i'm sorry i didn't know all the stuff you were going through too. annie is clearly sad.
speaker2: it's fine. i just feel really lost right
speaker1: nothing's going to change.
speaker2: oh dont say that.

speaker1: i mean between you and me. 
speaker2: you want to come in? steve's home. this could be your last chance as a single woman.
speaker1: ooooo...

speaker1: thanks a lot for bringing me. 
speaker2: thanks for coming with me.
speaker3: yeah, thanks for bringing him.

speaker1: so when does school start? 
speaker2: a week. i'm scared. i'm gonna be the oldest one there.
speaker1: so what? now you can have an affair with your teacher and it won't be gross. they walk down the steps.
speaker1: thanks for everything today. yo've been the best maid of honor ever.
speaker2: really?
speaker1: mmm. no. that's not true at all. you were pretty terrible. today you were good.
speaker2: oh, i want to catch this shuttle back to the hotel.
speaker1: you're always gonna be my best friend.
speaker2: i will see you in a couple weeks mrs.

speaker1: wait! wait! stop! great. of course. 
speaker2: need a ride ma'am?
speaker1: how did you know i was here?
speaker2: it was really complicated. i remembered the name of this place, i called them up, told them i was a cop calling on official police business, doing a very big investigation and uh, made them tell me all the weddings they had planned for the next two months with a bride named lillian. [alt: i'm a cop] annie smiles.
speaker1: wow.
speaker1: so, did you get the moonpies?
speaker2: yes i did.
speaker1: did you like' em?
speaker2: yeah. no. i couldn't eat them. they were completely covered in ants.
speaker1: ooo, i didn't think about that.

speaker1: you probably should have put it in a plastic wrap or maybe a foil or something. tupperware would've worked but then i'd have to get it back to you-i'm gonna kiss you right now so... 
speaker1: i didn't want to miss my chance again.
speaker2: me neither. they make out.

speaker1: need a ride ma'am? 
speaker2: how did you know i was here?
speaker1: i'm a cop.
speaker2: so, did you get the moonpies?
speaker1: yes i did.
speaker2: did you like' em?
speaker1: yeah. no. i couldn't eat them. they were completely covered in ants.
