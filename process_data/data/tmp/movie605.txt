speaker1: she isn't coming yet, toto. did she hurt you? she tried to, didn't she? come on - - we'll go tell uncle henry and auntie em. come on, toto. 
speaker1: aunt em! aunt em!
speaker1: aunt em!
speaker2: fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
speaker1: just listen to what miss gulch did to toto! she --
speaker2: dorothy, please! we're trying to count!
speaker1: oh, but aunt em, she hit him over the --

speaker1: don't bother us now, honey -- this old incubator's gone bad, and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks. 
speaker2: oh -- oh, the poor little things. oh, but aunt em, miss gulch hit toto right over the back with a rake just because she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat every day.
speaker3: seventy -- dorothy, please!
speaker2: oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week. and he can't catch her old cat, anyway. and now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
speaker3: dorothy! dorothy! we're busy!
speaker2: oh -- all right.
speaker1: poor little orphan, and her miss gulch troubles. gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
speaker3: i know, but we all got to work out our own problems, henry.
speaker1: yes.
speaker3: oh, i hope we got them in time.
speaker1: yes.
speaker4: how's she coming?

speaker1: take it easy. 
speaker1: ow! you got my finger! cs -- zeke and hickory holding wagon bed --
speaker2: well, why don't you get your finger out of the way!
speaker3: come on - come on - over this way.
speaker2: okay.
speaker3: there you are.
speaker1: right on my finger!
speaker2: it's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.
speaker4: zeke, what am i going to do about miss gulch? just because toto chases her old cat --
speaker2: listen, honey, i got them hogs to get in.
speaker1: now lookit, dorothy, you ain't using your head about miss gulch. think you didn't have any brains at all.
speaker4: i have so got brains.

speaker1: well, why don't you use them? when you come home, don't go by miss gulch's place. then toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. 
speaker2: oh, hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
speaker1: well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
speaker3: oh! oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. listen, dorothy, don't let hunk kid you about miss gulch. she's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. you know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
speaker2: well, gee, i try and have a heart.
speaker3: now look, here's something that really has a heart. this is the best invention i ever invented.
speaker2: this?
speaker3: sure. it's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? i'll show you. it works perfectly now. here's the principle. you see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. these air currents -- oh, stop it!
speaker2: oh!

speaker1: who did it? now wait a minute. 
speaker2: hickory!
speaker1: now what happened? i'll bet hunk did that.
speaker3: say! get in there before i make a dime bank out of you! listen, kid, are you going to let that old gulch heifer try and buffalo you?
speaker3: she ain't nothing to be afraid of. have a little courage, that's all.
speaker2: i'm not afraid of her.
speaker3: then the next time she squawks, walk right up to her and spit in her eye. that's what i'd do!
speaker2: oh!

speaker1: oh! oh, zeke! help! help me, zeke! 
speaker2: are you all right, dorothy?
speaker1: yes, i'm all right. oh -- i fell in and - - and zeke --
speaker1: why, zeke, -- you're just as scared as i am!
speaker3: what's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
speaker2: look at you, zeke -- you're just as white

speaker1: here, here, what's all this jabber- wapping when there's work to be done? i know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it! 
speaker2: well, dorothy was walking along the --
speaker1: i saw you tinkering with that contraption, hickory. now, you and hunk get back to that wagon!
speaker2: all right, mrs. gale. but some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --

speaker1: well, don't start posing for it now. here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. have some crullers. 
speaker2: gosh, mrs. gale.
speaker1: just fried.
speaker3: thanks.
speaker2: swell.
speaker4: you see, dorothy toppled in with the big duroc...
speaker1: it's no place for dorothy about a pig sty! now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!
speaker4: yes'am.
speaker5: auntie em, really -- you know what miss gulch said she was gonna do to toto? she said she was gonna --
speaker1: now, dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. you always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
speaker5: no --
speaker1: now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble. mcu -- dorothy reacts -- speaks --
speaker5: some place where there isn't any trouble.

speaker1: do you suppose there is such a place, toto? there must be. it's not a place you can get to by a boat or a train. it's far, far away -- behind the moon -- beyond the rain -- 
speaker2: mr. gale!
speaker3: howdy, miss gulch.
speaker2: i want to see you and your wife right away....

speaker1: ... about dorothy. 
speaker2: dorothy? well, what has dorothy done?
speaker1: what's she done? i'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
speaker2: you mean she bit you?
speaker1: no, her dog!
speaker2: oh, she bit her dog, eh?

speaker1: that dog's a menace to the community. i'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed. 
speaker2: destroyed? toto? oh, you can't! you mustn't! auntie em! uncle henry! you won't let her, will you?
speaker3: of course we won't. will we, em?

speaker1: please, aunt em, toto didn't mean to. he didn't know he was doing anything wrong. i'm the one that ought to be punished. i let him go in her garden. you can send me to bed without supper -- 
speaker2: if you don't hand over that dog, i'll bring a damage suit that'll take your whole farm! there's a law protecting folks against dogs that bite!
speaker3: how would it be if she keeps him tied up? he's really gentle -- with gentle people, that is.
speaker2: well, that's for the sheriff to decide. here's his order allowing me to take him.
speaker4: uhh -- yeah --
speaker3: now, we can't go against the law, dorothy. i'm afraid poor toto will have to go.
speaker2: now you're seeing reason.
speaker1: no --
speaker2: here's what i'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
speaker1: oh, no, no! i won't let you take him! you go away, you....! oooh, i'll bite you myself!
speaker3: dorothy!
speaker1: you wicked old witch! uncle henry, auntie em, don't let 'em take toto!

speaker1: here! i've got an order! let me have... 
speaker2: stop her!
speaker3: put him in the basket, henry.
speaker1: the idea!
speaker2: oh, don't, uncle henry. oh, toto! don't...
speaker3: almira gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean you have the power to run the rest of us! for twenty- three years, i've been dying to tell you what i thought of you! and now -- well, being a christian woman, i can't say it!

speaker1: the crowned heads of europe let him in his 
speaker2: well, well, well -- house guests, huh? and who might you be? no, no -- now don't tell me.
speaker2: let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. no, that's not right. i -- you're -- you're going on a visit. no, i'm wrong. that's...you're -- running away.
speaker3: how did you guess?
speaker2: professor marvel never guesses -- he knows! now, why are you running away?

speaker1: why -- 
speaker2: no, no -- now don't tell me. they -- they don't understand you at home. they don't appreciate you. you want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
speaker1: why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
speaker2: yes --
speaker1: please, professor, why can't we go along with you?
speaker1: ...polite! we haven't been asked yet.
speaker2: he's perfectly welcome. as one dog to another, huh? here now -- let's see where were we?
speaker2: oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
speaker1: oh, no, i wanted to go along with you.
speaker2: oh --

speaker1: nobody cares about me at home. they wouldn't even miss me. 
speaker2: aw, come, come, come --
speaker1: no, they won't - honestly.
speaker2: oh --
speaker1: auntie em was even going to let them kill toto yesterday for biting miss gulch. oh, please, professor, why can't we go with you and see all the crowned heads of europe?
speaker2: do you know any? oh, you mean the thing - - yes, well, i -- i never do anything without consulting my crystal first. let's....
speaker2: ...go inside here -- we'll -- just come along. i'll show you. there you are - right in there.
speaker2: that's right. here -- sit right down here. that's it. ha ha! this -- this is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal used by the priests of isis and osiris in the days of the pharaohs of egypt -- in which cleopatra first saw the approach of julius caesar and marc anthony, and -- and so on -- and so on. now, you -- you'd better close your eyes, my child, for a moment -- in order to be better in tune with the infinite. we -- we can't do these things without....

speaker1: ...infinite. yes. 
speaker1: that's -- that's all right. now you can open them. we'll gaze into the crystal. ahh -- what's this i see? a house -- with a picket fence....
speaker1: ...and a barn -- with a weather vane and a -- of a -- of a running horse.
speaker1: no - it's - it's - a crowing rooster.
speaker2: that's our farm!
speaker1: oh -- yes.
speaker1: yes, there's -- there's a woman -- she's.... insert -- cu of the photograph -

speaker1: ...her face is careworn. 
speaker2: yes...that's aunt em.
speaker1: her -- her name is emily.
speaker2: that's right. what's she doing?
speaker1: well, i -- i can't quite see. why, she's crying.
speaker2: oh --
speaker1: someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
speaker2: me?
speaker1: well, it's -- it's someone she loves very much. someone she's been very kind to. someone she's taken care of in sickness.
speaker2: i had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
speaker1: uh-huh.
speaker2: what's she doing now?

speaker1: well, she's - she's going into a little bed.... cu - dorothy - camera shooting past professor - 
speaker1: ...room --
speaker2: has it poppies on the wall.... mcu - professor - camera shooting past dorothy
speaker2: ...paper?
speaker1: i said it had poppies on the wall paper! eh -- she's -- what's this? why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
speaker1: ...bed.
speaker2: oh, no -- no!
speaker1: that's all -- the crystal's gone dark.
speaker2: oh, you....
speaker2: ...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? oh -- oh, i've got to go home right away!
speaker1: but -- what's this? i thought you were going along with me.
speaker2: oh, no, no, i have to get to her right....

speaker1: ...away! come on, toto! oh, what'll i do? if we go home, they'll send you to the sheriff. and if we don't, aunt em may -- well, she may die! i know what i'll do - i'll give you to hunk. he'll watch out for you. but we've got to hurry. goodbye, professor marvel -- and thanks a lot! 
speaker2: better get under cover, sylvester -- there's a storm blowing up -- a whopper, to speak in the vernacular of the peasantry. poor little kid -- i hope she gets home all right.

speaker1: hunk, get them horses loose! where's hickory. hickory! hickory! doggone it! hick -- hickory o.s. right here. 
speaker1: hey, what are you doing there?
speaker2: this is my chance! the cyclone is coming. let me show you what my machine can do! you see, it goes --

speaker1: doggone you! help hunk get them horses loose! 
speaker2: all right - you'll be sorry.
speaker1: go on, hurry up! hurry up, i tell you!
speaker3: she's here -- it's a twister! els -- the gale farm -- cyclone approaching --
speaker4: dorothy! dorothy!
speaker1: come on -- everybody in the storm cellar!
speaker4: henry! henry! i can't find dorothy! she's somewhere out in the storm! dorothy!
speaker5: auntie em! auntie em!

speaker1: we're not on the ground, toto! 
speaker1: we must be up inside.... mcs -- toto

speaker1: now i -- i know we're not in kansas. 
speaker2: are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
speaker1: who, me? why, i'm not a witch at all.

speaker1: oh! well.... 
speaker2: who, toto?
speaker2: toto's my dog.
speaker1: well, i'm a little muddled. the munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the wicked witch of the east. and there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
speaker1: ...is, are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
speaker2: oh, but i've already told you, i'm not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly. what was that? mcu -- glinda looks to r.f.g. and speaks --
speaker1: the munchkins. they're laughing because i am a witch. i'm glinda, the witch of the north.

speaker1: you are! oh, i beg your pardon! but i've never heard of a beautiful.... mcu -- glinda looks to r.f.g. and speaks -- dorothy o.s. 
speaker2: only bad witches are ugly.
speaker2: the munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the wicked witch of the east.
speaker1: oh. but, if you please -- what are munchkins?
speaker2: the little people who live in this land -- it's munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear. it's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. it's all right now - you may all come out.
speaker3: kansas she says is the name of the star.

speaker1: and oh, what happened then was rich! 
speaker2: the house began to pitch the kitchen took a slitch

speaker1: ....sitch- 
speaker1: ...the wicked....
speaker1: ...witch!
speaker2: we thank you very sweetly for doing it so neatly.

speaker1: ...low 
speaker2: as mayor of the munchkin city in the county of the land of oz i welcome you most regally
speaker3: but we've got to verify it legally to see...
speaker2: to see?
speaker3: if she...
speaker2: if she?
speaker3: is morally, ethic'ly
speaker4: spiritually, physically
speaker5: positively, absolutely

speaker1: as coroner, i must aver i thoroughly examined her. and she's not only merely dead, she's really, most sincerely dead. 
speaker2: then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins and their descendants!
speaker3: if any!
speaker2: yes, let the joyous news be spread.
speaker2: the wicked old witch at last is dead!

speaker1: we wish to welcome you to munchkinland. 
speaker2: from now on you'll be history
speaker3: you'll be hist...
speaker4: you'll be hist...
speaker2: you'll be history
speaker5: and we will glorify your name

speaker1: you'll be a bust... 
speaker2: be a bust...
speaker3: be a bust...
speaker4: in the hall of fame!
speaker5: i thought you said she was dead.
speaker6: that was her sister -- the wicked witch of the east. this is the wicked witch of the west. and she's worse than the other one was.
speaker7: who killed my sister? who killed the witch of the east? was it you? answer me!
speaker6: leave her alone!

speaker1: you stay out of this! i'm here for vengeance! so it was you, was it? you killed her,.... 
speaker1: ...didn't you?
speaker2: no -- no! it was an accident! i didn't mean to kill anybody!....
speaker1: didn't mean it, eh? accident, eh? well, my little pretty, i can cause accidents, too -- and this is how i do it! glinda o.s.
speaker3: ...ting the ruby slippers?
speaker1: the slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
speaker1: they're gone!
speaker1: the ruby slippers! what have you done with them? give them back to me, or i'll -

speaker1: it's too late! there they.... 
speaker2: oh!
speaker3: i'm the only one that knows how to use them. they're of no use to you! give them back to me!
speaker1: keep tight inside of them -- their magic must be very powerful, or she wouldn't want them so badly!
speaker3: you stay out of this, glinda, or i'll fix you as well!
speaker1: oh, rubbish! you have no power here. be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
speaker3: very well -- i'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, i can't attend to you here and now as i'd like, but just try to stay out of my way.... mcu -- witch threatens dorothy o.s. in f.g. --
speaker3: ... -- just try! i'll get you, my....

speaker1: it's all right. you can get up -- she's gone. 
speaker1: it's all right. you can all get up.
speaker1: pooh -- what a smell of sulphur! i'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the wicked witch of the west. the sooner you get out of oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
speaker2: oh, i'd give anything to get out of oz altogether -- but which is the way back to kansas? i can't go the way i came.
speaker1: no -- that's true. the only person who might know would be the great and wonderful wizard of oz himself!
speaker2: the wizard of oz? is he good or is he wicked?
speaker1: oh, very good, but very mysterious. he lives in the emerald city, and that's a long journey from here. did you bring your broomstick with you?

speaker1: no, i'm afraid i didn't. 
speaker2: well, then, you'll have to walk. the munchkins will see you safely to the border of munchkinland. and remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the wicked witch of the west.
speaker1: but, how do i start for emerald city?
speaker2: it's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the yellow brick road.
speaker1: but -- what happens if i --- cs -- glinda speaks to dorothy o.s. in f.g. --
speaker2: just follow the yellow brick road.

speaker1: my -- ! people come and go so quickly here! follow the yellow brick road. 
speaker2: follow the yellow brick road.
speaker3: follow the yellow brick road.
speaker4: follow the yellow brick road.
speaker5: follow the yellow brick road.

speaker1: follow the yellow brick road. follow the yellow brick road. follow, follow, follow, follow, follow the yellow brick road. follow the yellow brick follow the... 
speaker1: you're off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of oz!

speaker1: now which way do we go? 
speaker2: that way is a very nice way. cs -- scarecrow, his arm pointing to right --
speaker1: who said that?
speaker1: don't be silly, toto. scarecrows....
speaker1: ...don't talk.
speaker2: it's pleasant down that way, too.
speaker1: that's funny. wasn't he pointing the other way?
speaker2: ...go both ways!
speaker1: why....

speaker1: are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind? 
speaker2: that's the trouble. i can't make up my mind. i haven't got a brain -- only straw.
speaker1: how can you talk if you haven't got a.... mcu -- scarecrow speaks to dorothy o.s.in f.g. -- dorothy o.s. ...brain?
speaker2: i don't know. but some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, don't they?
speaker1: yes, i guess you're right.
speaker1: well, we haven't really met properly, have we?
speaker2: why, no.

speaker1: cs -- dorothy curtsies, speaks -- 
speaker2: how do you do?
speaker3: how do you do?
speaker2: very well, thank you.
speaker3: oh, i'm not feeling at all well. you see, it's very tedious being stuck up here all day long with a pole up your back. mcu -- dorothy --
speaker2: oh, dear -- that must be terribly uncomfortable. can't you get down?
speaker3: down? no, you see, i'm -- well, -- i'm --
speaker2: oh, well, here -- let me help you.
speaker3: oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
speaker2: well, oh, dear -- i don't quite see....
speaker3: of course, i'm not bright about doing things, but if you'll just....

speaker1: oh.... 
speaker1: ...yes.
speaker2: ohhhh --
speaker1: ohh!

speaker1: whhhooops! ha-ha -- there goes some of me again! 
speaker2: oh -- does it hurt you?
speaker1: oh, no -- i just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
speaker2: ohhh --
speaker1: my, it's good to be....

speaker1: ...free! 
speaker2: oh! oh! ohhh!

speaker1: did i scare you? 
speaker2: no, no -- i -- i just thought you hurt yourself.
speaker1: but i didn't scare you?
speaker2: no -- of course not.
speaker1: i didn't think so.
speaker1: boo! you see, i can't even scare a crow! they come from miles.... mcu -- dorothy listening -- scarecrow o.s.
speaker1: oh, i'm a failure, because i haven't got a brain. mcu -- dorothy reacts, speaks --
speaker2: well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?

speaker1: do? why, if i had a brain, i could -- i could while away the hours, conferrin' with the flowers, consultin' with the rain. and my head i'd be scratchin' while my thoughts were busy hatchin' if i only had a brain. i'd unravel every riddle for any individ'le 
speaker1: ...life would be a ding-a-derry if i only had a brain!

speaker1: wonderful! why, if our scarecrow back in kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces! 
speaker2: they would?
speaker1: um-hmm.
speaker2: where's kansas?
speaker1: that's where i live. and i want to get back there so badly i'm going all the way to emerald city to get the wizard of oz to help me.
speaker2: you're going to see a wizard?
speaker1: um-hmm.

speaker1: do you think if i went with you this wizard would give me some brains? 
speaker2: i couldn't say. but even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
speaker1: yes -- that's true.
speaker2: but maybe you'd better not. i've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
speaker1: witch? huh! i'm not afraid of a witch! i'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
speaker2: i don't blame you for that.
speaker1: but i'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains. look - - i won't be any trouble, because i don't eat a thing -- and i won't try to manage things, because i can't think. won't you take me with you?
speaker2: why, of course i will!
speaker1: hooray! we're off to see a wizard!
speaker2: oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
speaker1: oh, i'll try! really, i will.

speaker1: to oz? 
speaker2: to oz!

speaker1: oh -- apples -- oh look! oh. oh --- 
speaker1: ouch!

speaker1: what do you think you're doing? 
speaker2: we've been walking a long ways and i was hungry and -- did you say.... mcu -- the first tree -- gestures as it speaks --
speaker3: she....

speaker1: ...was hungry! well, how would you like to have someone come along and pick something off of you? 
speaker2: oh, dear -- i keep forgetting i'm not in kansas.
speaker3: come along, dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples. hmm! mcu -- first tree reacts, and speaks --
speaker1: what do you mean - she doesn't want any of those apples? are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be? mcu - - scarecrow and dorothy --
speaker3: oh, no! it's just that she doesn't like little green....
speaker4: oh....
speaker4: ...you...
speaker3: go -- go!
speaker4: ...oh -- help -- let me out. i'll give you little green....

speaker1: i'll show you how to get apples. tree o.s. 
speaker2: ...do that to me! i'll....
speaker3: you can't do that! you can't do that! hey!
speaker1: hooray! i guess that did it! help yourself.
speaker4: oh --
speaker4: why, it's a man! a man made out of tin!
speaker1: what?
speaker4: yes. oh -- look --
speaker5: oil can.....oil can....

speaker1: did you say something? 
speaker2: oil can....
speaker3: oil can what?
speaker1: oil can? oh -- oh, here it is!
speaker1: where do you want to be oiled first?
speaker2: my mouth -- my mouth!
speaker3: he said his mouth.
speaker1: here -- here --
speaker3: the other side....
speaker1: yes --- there.

speaker1: mm.....mm...mm.... 
speaker1: ...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- i can talk again! oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
speaker2: oh...

speaker1: oh -- 
speaker2: ...oh, did that hurt?
speaker1: no -- it feels wonderful. i've held that axe up for ages. oh ---
speaker2: oh, goodness! how did you ever get like this?
speaker1: oh -- well, about a year ago -- i was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
speaker1: ...and right in the middle of a chop, i...i rusted solid. and i've been that way ever since.
speaker2: well, you're perfect now.
speaker1: my...my neck. my...my neck. perfect? oh -- bang on my chest if you think i'm perfect. go ahead -- bang on it!
speaker2: oh --!
speaker3: beautiful! what an echo!
speaker1: it's empty. the tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.

speaker1: no heart? 
speaker2: no heart.
speaker3: oh --
speaker2: all hollow. oh --
speaker2: ...and the boy who shoots the arrows if i only had a heart. picture me....a balcony....above a voice sings low.
speaker4: wherefore art thou, romeo?
speaker2: i hear a beat....how sweet! just to register emotion jealousy -- devotion -- and really feel the part, i could stay young and chipper, and i'd lock it with a zipper, if i only had a heart...!

speaker1: oh -- 
speaker1: oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
speaker2: i'm afraid i'm a little rusty yet.
speaker1: oh, dear -- that was wonderful! you know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to emerald city with us to ask the wizard of oz for a heart.
speaker2: emerald city? why, that's a long and dangerous journey. and it might rain on the way.

speaker1: but you've just been saying how much you want a heart. 
speaker2: and i'll keep the oil-can handy.
speaker3: well, suppose the wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
speaker2: oh, but he will! he must! we've come such a long way already.
speaker3: ohh -- what's that? oh --
speaker4: you call that long?
speaker4: why, you've just begun! forgotten about me,....
speaker4: helping the little lady along, are you, my fine gentlemen?
speaker4: or i'll stuff a mattress with you!
speaker4: here, scarecrow! want to play ball?

speaker2: well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you? is my nose bleeding?
speaker1: well, of course not. my goodness, what a fuss you're making. well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
speaker2: you're right -- i am a coward.
speaker2: i haven't any courage at all. i even scare myself. look at the circles under my eyes.

speaker1: i haven't slept in weeks. 
speaker2: why don't you try counting sheep?

speaker4: oh.

speaker1: yeh, it's sad, believe me, missy when you're born to be a sissy, without the vim and verve. but i could show my prowess -- be a lion not a mou-ess -- if i only had the nerve i'm afraid there's no denyin' i'm just a dande-lion -- a fate i don't deserve. i'd be brave as a blizzard -- 
speaker2: i'd be gentle as a lizard --
speaker3: i'd be clever as a gizzard --
speaker3: then i'm sure to get a brain --
speaker2: a heart --
speaker4: a home --
speaker1: the nerve.

speaker1: there's emerald....

speaker2: if you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!

speaker1: do you presume to criticize the.... 
speaker1: ...great oz? you ungrateful creatures!
speaker1: think yourselves lucky that i'm....
speaker1: ...giving you audience tomorrow, instead of....
speaker1: ...twenty years from now. oh -- oh oh!

speaker1: ... oh .... oh .... 
speaker2: who are you?
speaker1: oh - i - pay no....

speaker1: ...attention to that man behind the curtain. go - before i lose my temper! the great and powerful ---.... 
speaker1: ... -- oz -- has spoken!
speaker2: who are you?
speaker1: well, i -- i -- i am the great and powerful -- wizard of oz.
speaker2: you are?
speaker3: uhhhh -- yes...
speaker2: i don't believe you!
speaker3: no, i'm afraid it's true. there's no other wizard except me.
speaker4: you humbug!
speaker5: yeah!

speaker1: yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so. i'm a humbug! 
speaker2: oh ....
speaker2: ...you're a very bad man! mcu -- the wizard reacts, speaks humbly --
speaker1: oh, no, my dear -- i'm -- i'm a very good man. i'm just a very bad wizard.
speaker3: you'd better be good enough to send dorothy back to kansas!
speaker1: uh - now, please don't be angry with me. i'll - i'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. it makes me nervous!
speaker3: it makes you nervous?
speaker1: yes.
speaker3: what about us?
speaker1: well, i --
speaker3: what about the heart that you promised tin man --?

speaker1: well, i -- 
speaker2: -- and the courage that you promised cowardly lion?
speaker1: well, i --

speaker1: well, i-- but you've got them. you've had them all the... 
speaker1: ...time!
speaker2: oh, no we haven't!
speaker3: you don't get around us that easy!
speaker4: not nohow!
speaker1: well --
speaker5: you promised us real things -- a real...
speaker5: ...brain!
speaker4: real courage. that's what we want.

speaker1: you do? boys, you're aiming low. you not only surprise, but you grieve me. 
speaker1: why, anybody can have a brain. that's a very mediocre commodity. every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has a brain!
speaker1: from the rock-bound coast of maine to the sun.... oh - oh, no -- -- ah - well, be that as it may. back where i come from we have universities, seats of great learning -- where men go to become great thinkers. and when they come out, they think deep thoughts -- and with no more brains than you have.... but! they have one thing you haven't got! a diploma!
speaker1: therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the universitatus committeeatum e plurbis unum, i hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of th.d.
speaker2: th.d.?
speaker1: yeah -- that...that's dr. of thinkology!

speaker1: the sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. oh joy, rapture! i've got a brain! 
speaker1: how can i ever thank you enough?
speaker2: well, you can't. as for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking. you are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage. you're confusing courage with wisdom. back where i come from, we have men who are called heroes. once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city. and they have no more courage than you have. but! they have one thing that you haven't got! a medal! therefore -- for meritorious....
speaker2: ...conduct, extraordinary valor, conspicuous bravery against wicked witches, i award you the triple cross.
speaker2: you are now a member of the legion of courage!
speaker3: oh -- oh -- shucks, folks, i'm speechless!

speaker1: as for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! you don't know how lucky you are not to have one. hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. i could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had i not been obstructed by a heart. 
speaker2: but i still want one.
speaker1: yes -- ....
speaker1: ...back where i come from there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds. they are called phil...er -- er -- phil -- er, yes...good-deed-doers. and their hearts are no bigger than yours. but! they have one thing you haven't got! a testimonial!
speaker1: therefore, in consideration of your kindness, i take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. and remember, my sentimental friend....
speaker1: ...that a heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others.

speaker1: ahh --- oh, it ticks! listen! 
speaker2: yes...!
speaker2: ...yes.
speaker1: look -- it ticks!
speaker3: read...read what my medal says.

speaker1: courage!... 
speaker1: ...ain't it the truth! ain't it the truth!
speaker2: oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
speaker3: hey -- what about dorothy?
speaker4: yes -- how about dorothy?
speaker1: yeah.
speaker5: ah --
speaker1: dorothy next!

speaker1: yes. dorothy -- ah -- dor -- cu -- dorothy -- 
speaker2: oh, i don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
speaker1: well, no - no -- on the contrary, on the -

speaker1: ...i -- ah -- on the contr -- -- here -- well, you force me into a cataclysmic decision. the only way to get dorothy back to kansas is for me to take her there myself! cu -- dorothy reacts, speaks -- 
speaker2: oh, will you? could you? oh -- but are you a clever enough wizard.... mcu -- the wizard -- dorothy o.s.
speaker1: child -- you cut me to the quick! i'm an old kansas man myself...born and....
speaker1: ...excellence to the miracle wonderland carnival company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. the balloon failed to return to the fair.

speaker1: it did? 
speaker2: yes. there was i, floating through space - - a man without a continent! cu -- dorothy --
speaker3: weren't you frightened?
speaker2: frightened? you are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. i was petrified. then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where i was instantly acclaimed oz, the first wizard de luxe!
speaker3: ohhh!
speaker2: times being what they were, i accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away. and in that balloon, my dear dorothy, you and i will return to the land of e pluribus unum!

speaker1: -- yes -- well -- be that as it may -- i, your wizard par ardua ad alta, am about to embark upon a hazardous and technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere. 
speaker1: to confer, converse, and otherwise hob- with my brother wizards. and i hereby decree that until what time -- if any -- that i return, the scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains, shall rule in my stead...assisted by the tin man, by virtue of his magnificent heart...and the lion -- by virtue of his courage! obey them as you would me! and - ah - well, that's all.
speaker2: oh, come back here! toto!
speaker2: come back! oh, don't go without me! i'll be right back! toto!
speaker3: stop that dog!
speaker1: this is a highly irregular procedure!

speaker1: oh! help me! the balloon's going up! 
speaker2: -- ruined my exit!
speaker1: help!
speaker3: oh! come back! don't go without me!
speaker2: i can't come back! i don't know how it works!
speaker3: oh --
speaker2: goodbye, folks!
speaker4: goodbye! goodbye!
speaker3: oh, now i'll never get home!
speaker5: stay with us, then, dorothy. we all love you. we don't want you to go.
speaker3: oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like kansas. auntie em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. oh, scarecrow, what am i going to do?
speaker6: look -- here's someone who can help you!

speaker1: oh, will you help me? can you help me? 
speaker2: you don't need to be helped any longer. you've always had the power to go back to kansas.
speaker1: i have?
speaker3: then why didn't you tell her before?
speaker2: because she wouldn't have believed me.
speaker4: what have you learned, dorothy?
speaker1: well, i -- i think that it -- that it wasn't enough just to want to see uncle henry and auntie em -- and it's that -- if i ever go looking for my heart's desire again, i won't look any further than my own backyard. because if it isn't there, i never really lost it to begin with! is that right?
speaker2: that's all it is!
speaker3: but that's so easy! i should have thought of it for you.

speaker1: i should have felt it in my heart. 
speaker2: no. she had to find it out for herself. now, those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds!
speaker3: oh....
speaker3: ...toto, too?
speaker2: toto, too.
speaker3: oh, now?
speaker2: whenever you wish.
speaker3: oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. i love you all, too. goodbye, tin man. oh, don't cry. you'll rust so dreadfully. here -- here's your oil-can. goodbye.
speaker1: now i know i've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
speaker3: oh -- goodbye, lion. you know, i know it isn't right, but i'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
speaker4: well -- i would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.

speaker1: i think i'll miss you most of all. 
speaker2: are you ready now?
speaker1: yes. say goodbye, toto.
speaker1: yes, i'm ready now.
speaker2: then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
speaker2: and think to yourself -- "there's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
speaker1: there's no place like home. there's no place like home. there's no place like home. there's no place like home.

speaker1: -- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place -- 
speaker2: dorothy. dorothy, dear. it's aunt em, darling.
speaker1: oh, auntie em -- it's you!
speaker2: yes, darling.
speaker3: hello, there! anybody home? i -- i just dropped by because i heard the little girl got caught in the big -- well....

speaker1: she got quite a bump on the head -- we kinda thought there for a minute she was going to leave us. 
speaker2: oh --
speaker3: but i did leave you, uncle henry -- that's just the trouble. and i tried to get back for days and days.
speaker4: there, there, lie quiet now. you just had a bad dream.
speaker3: no --
speaker5: sure -- remember me -- your old pal, hunk?
speaker6: and me -- hickory?
speaker7: you couldn't forget my face, could you?
speaker3: no. but it wasn't a dream -- it was a place. and you -- and you -- and you -- and you were there.
speaker2: oh --
speaker3: but you couldn't have been, could you?
speaker4: oh, we dream lots of silly things when we

speaker1: ...but most of it was beautiful. but just the same, all i kept saying to everybody was, i want to go home. and they sent me home. 
speaker1: doesn't anybody believe me?
speaker2: of course we believe you, dorothy.
speaker1: oh, but anyway, toto, we're home!
speaker1: home! and this is my room -- and you're all here! and i'm not going to leave here ever, ever again, because i love you all! and -- oh, auntie em -- there's no place like home!
