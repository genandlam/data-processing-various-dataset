speaker2: i'm talking now.

speaker1: are you sure? 
speaker2: yes.

speaker1: don't look. 
speaker1: you don't need to see this.
speaker2: there could be something here.
speaker1: no, they ran out of food.
speaker2: maybe we could find some hayseeds in the hayloft?
speaker1: it's not what-you think. they committed suicide.
speaker2: what does that mean?

speaker1: come here. 
speaker1: you see that? two left. one for you and one for me.

speaker1: you promised not to do that. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: you know what, papa. i have to watch you all the time.
speaker2: i know i'm sorry.
speaker1: if you break little promises you'll break big ones. that's what you said.

speaker1: watch your finger. 
speaker2: you always say that.
speaker1: that's because you always do it.
speaker2: what are you doing?
speaker1: we have to keep moving. we have to go south to the coast.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: it'll be better at the coast.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: because we're going to freeze here.

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: can you read that?
speaker3: no.
speaker2: good, let's go.

speaker1: i can't, i just can't... 
speaker2: there's no other way.
speaker1: we could go over.
speaker2: we can't take the cart over.
speaker1: we don't know what's in there.
speaker2: there's nothing in there. it's just the same as it is out here. okay?
speaker1: okay.

speaker1: just remember that the things you put into your head are forever. 
speaker2: but you forget some things don't you?
speaker1: you forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget.

speaker1: quickly. quick... 
speaker1: it's all right. it's all right but we have to run. don't look back. come on.
speaker1: run... run...
speaker1: you okay? it's all right... come on...

speaker1: just keep it coming. 
speaker1: don't look at them. look at me. if you call out you're dead. where you from?
speaker2: does it matter? where you from?
speaker1: what's the truck running on?
speaker2: diesel fuel.
speaker1: where d'you get that?

speaker1: i told you not to look back there.
speaker2: found it.
speaker1: what are you eating?
speaker2: whatever we can find.
speaker1: whatever you can find, huh?
speaker2: yeah...
speaker2: you won't shoot that thing. you ain't got but two shells. maybe just one. and they'll hear the shot.
speaker1: maybe. but you won't. it'll be through your skull and inside your brain before you can hear it.

speaker1: to hear it you'll need a frontal lobe and things with names like colliculus and temporal gyrus and you won't have them anymore because they'll just be soup. 
speaker2: are you a doctor?
speaker1: i'm not anything anymore.
speaker2: we got a hurt man. it'd be worth your while.
speaker1: if you look at him again i'll shoot you in the head.
speaker2: i'll bet that boy is hungry. why don't you all just come onto the truck. get something to eat. ain't no need to be such a hard ass.
speaker1: you don't have anything to eat.
speaker2: i ain't going nowheres.
speaker1: you think i won't kill you but you're wrong.
speaker2: you know what i think? i think you're chickenshit. you never killed a man in your life.

speaker1: what do you think you're going to do with that? 
speaker2: move! let's go!

speaker1: shh. it's okay now. you're going to be ok. 
speaker1: come on.

speaker1: it's okay... it's okay now... 
speaker1: i try to look like any common traveling killer but my heart is hammering. when it comes to the boy i have only one question: can you do it? when the time comes?

speaker1: it's no use crying. you have to talk to me. 
speaker1: i'm not going to let anything happen to you... i'm going to take care of you... i'm always going to try and be here for you... and i'm going to kill anybody who touches you.
speaker1: because that's my job. do you understand?
speaker1: come on, we need to get the cart back.

speaker1: wait here. 
speaker1: no i need you to wait. i'll hear you if you call. i'll just be a little ways and i'll be able to hear you if you get scared and you call me and i'll come right away.
speaker2: i said wait!
speaker2: stop it. i need you to do what i say. take the gun.
speaker2: just take it will you?
speaker2: we don't have time for this. we need our food. what's left.
speaker2: don't argue.

speaker1: let's get out of here. the freeway's too dangerous. find the back roads. 
speaker2: okay.

speaker1: and they will him 
speaker2: please no - just - no
speaker1: they are going to us and kill us and eat us and you won't face it. you'd rather wait for it to happen.
speaker2: please.
speaker1: stop it.
speaker2: i'll do anything.
speaker1: such as what?
speaker1: i thought about not even telling you. just doing it. i'd empty every godamn bullet into my brain and leave you with nothing.
speaker2: don't say that. don't talk this way.
speaker1: there's nothing left to talk about... my heart was ripped out of me the night he was born...

speaker1: please don't do this. i won't let anything happen. we'll survive. 
speaker2: i don't want to survive! i'd take him with me if it weren't for you. you know i would. why can't you face it?
speaker1: will you listen? you're talking

speaker1: it's not crazy and you know it. it's the right thing to do. 
speaker1: other families do it.
speaker1: time for bed, there's a good boy.

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: it's a waterfall.
speaker1: look. colors.

speaker1: there used to be color everywhere. you don't remember. it was before you were born. there used to be so many thnings... 
speaker2: look. it's clear.
speaker1: do you want to go in?
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: sure you do.
speaker2: is it okay?
speaker1: just don't swallow any.

speaker1: what fire? 
speaker2: the fire inside you.
speaker1: are we still the good guys?
speaker2: yes. we're still the good guys.
speaker1: and we always will be no matter what happens?
speaker2: always will be. yeah.

speaker1: do you think there could be fish in the lake? 
speaker2: no. there's nothing in the lake.

speaker1: i'm hungry.

speaker2: and we're still going south?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: so we'll be warm?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: and there might be food there?
speaker1: everything depends on reaching the coast.
speaker2: okay.
speaker1: go to sleep.
speaker2: i wish i was with my mom.
speaker1: you mean you wish you were dead.
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: you mustn't say that. it's a bad thing to say.
speaker2: i can't help it.

speaker1: i know but you have to. you have to stop thinking about her. we both do. 
speaker2: how do i do that?

speaker1: she was gone, and the coldness of it was her final gift... she died somewhere in the dark... there is no other tale to tell. 
speaker1: will you tell him goodbye?
speaker2: no. i won't. i can't.
speaker1: will you at least wait till morning? stay with me through the night.
speaker2: no. i have to go now.

speaker1: what am i going to tell him? what are we going to do without you? 
speaker2: you should move south. you won't survive another winter here.
speaker1: why won't you help me?
speaker2: i can't help you. don't you understand? this is how i'm helping you.
speaker1: where are you going to go? you can't even see.

speaker1: what if it's more bad guys?
speaker2: it won't be more bad guys. don't worry. stay close.
speaker2: keep low. we'll be okay.

speaker1: i think we should take a look. 
speaker2: i'm scared.
speaker1: there's nothing to be scared of.

speaker1: you want to stay here? 
speaker2: no.

speaker1: papa? 
speaker2: shh.

speaker1: stop crying. you have to be a brave boy. you know how to do it. 
speaker2: i think so.
speaker1: say "yes i do papa."

speaker3: papa?
speaker4: i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.
speaker3: will i see you again? when will i see you?

speaker6: don't look at me like that. what are you doing?

speaker1: come on, keep running! 
speaker1: keep your head down.

speaker1: we'll be safe soon. 
speaker2: they're going to eat those people aren't they, papa? the man does not answer.

speaker1: papa? papa, we wouldn't ever eat anybody would we? 
speaker2: no. of course not.
speaker1: no matter how hungry we were. even if we were starving?

speaker1: we're starving now. 
speaker2: because, because we're the good guys?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: and we're carrying the fire.
speaker1: yes.

speaker1: it's a treat for you. here. sit down. 
speaker1: go ahead.
speaker2: it's bubbly.
speaker1: go ahead. drink it.
speaker2: it's really good. you have some, papa.
speaker1: no. i want you to drink it.
speaker2: but i want you to have some.
speaker2: it's because i'll never get to drink another one, isn't it?

speaker1: what's wrong with you? 
speaker2: what was that?
speaker1: i didn't hear anything.
speaker2: listen.
speaker1: i don't hear anything.
speaker1: it's a dog.
speaker2: a dog! where did it come from?
speaker1: i don't know. come on.
speaker2: we're not going to kill it are we papa?
speaker1: what? no, we're not going to kill it. why did you say that?
speaker2: you still got one bullet left.
speaker1: we're not going to hurt the dog, i promise. we're not going to kill it and we're not going to eat it either.
speaker3: maybe it'll eat us!

speaker1: i doubt it very much. 
speaker2: can we look for it?
speaker1: it's gone, okay?

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: i used to watch the ball games here with my father.

speaker1: what is this place, papa? 
speaker2: it's the house where i grew up.
speaker2: you coming?
speaker1: i don't want to.
speaker2: don't you want to see where i grew up?

speaker1: there might be somebody in there. 
speaker2: there's nobody there now.
speaker1: i'm scared.
speaker2: we've got to find something to eat.
speaker1: i'm not hungry. i'm not!
speaker2: we'll be all right. come on.

speaker1: papa? i don't think we should do this. 
speaker2: you want to wait outside?
speaker2: all right.
speaker2: sit here on the stoop and don't go away.

speaker1: where are you?! 
speaker2: what are you doing? what the are you doing?
speaker1: there's a little boy, papa, i saw a little boy.
speaker2: there's no little boy. what's the matter with you?
speaker1: yes there is! i saw him! a boy just like me.
speaker1: why? why can't i go and see him?

speaker1: why? 
speaker2: i just do!
speaker1: okay, i'm sorry. i understand.

speaker1: papa? will there be other boys like me at the coast? 
speaker2: i hope so.

speaker1: i got you something 
speaker2: what is it?
speaker1: it's an apple.

speaker1: it a while and it'll soften. 
speaker2: did you ever have any friends?
speaker1: yes. i did.
speaker2: lots of them?
speaker1: yes...
speaker2: do you remember them?
speaker1: yes. i remember all of them...
speaker2: what happened to them?
speaker1: they died.
speaker2: all of them?
speaker1: yes. all of them.

speaker1: do you know where we are papa? 
speaker2: i think we're about two hundred miles from the coast. as the crow flies.
speaker1: "as the crow flies?"
speaker2: it means, going in a straight line.

speaker1: there aren't any crows are there? 
speaker2: yeah, just in books...
speaker1: do you think there might be crows somewhere?

speaker1: i don't know... 
speaker2: but what do you think?
speaker1: i think it's unlikely...
speaker2: could they fly to mars or some place?
speaker1: no, they couldn't fly to mars...
speaker2: because it's too far?
speaker1: yes.
speaker2: what if they tried and-and-and they just got halfway or something and then they were too tired? would they fall back down...?

speaker1: we can't go back on the road. 
speaker2: why, papa?
speaker1: i think someone's coming.

speaker1: will they see our tracks? 
speaker2: we'll cover them.
speaker2: here they come.

speaker1: move! quickly! 
speaker2: what's happening?
speaker1: just keep moving, run!

speaker1: yes. 
speaker2: there's nothing left anywhere.
speaker1: no.
speaker2: can i ask you something?
speaker1: sure.
speaker2: are we going to die now?
speaker1: what do you think is going to happen? we're just going to suddenly keel over and die? it takes a long time to die of starvation. the important thing is water to stop you dehydrating. we've got water. we'll be all right.

speaker1: every day is a lie. but i am slowly dying. that is not a lie .i am trying to prepare him for the day when i am gone. 
speaker1: nothing you haven't seen before.

speaker1: we look skinny. 
speaker2: we are skinny.
speaker1: what is it?
speaker2: it's a piano.
speaker1: what's it for?
speaker2: for making music. this... is music. your mother played very well.
speaker1: i don't remember.
speaker2: before you were born. we had one just like it. it was beautiful.
speaker1: what happened to it?
speaker2: chopped it up for firewood.

speaker1: i used to worry what would happen if there was a fire. what would i save? what could i bear to lose? there used to be so many things, so many beautiful things. things people made. things nature made. 
speaker2: i'll strip the floorboards.
speaker1: you can't live without a floor.
speaker2: you can't live without a piano.
speaker1: it's my piano.
speaker2: i bought it for you.
speaker1: it needs tuning. who's going to tune it? can you tune it?

speaker1: don't open it, papa. 
speaker2: it'll be okay.
speaker1: please, papa, please.
speaker2: it's okay.
speaker1: no it's not! what if there's people hiding down there?
speaker2: oh my oh my
speaker1: what is it, papa?
speaker3: come down. oh my come down.

speaker1: papa? what did you find? 
speaker2: everything. i found everything.

speaker1: can you see? 
speaker2: what is all this stuff?
speaker1: it's food! can you read the labels?
speaker2: "pears." it says "pears."
speaker1: yes! it does! oh yes it does! pears!
speaker2: is it real?
speaker1: oh yes, it's real all right.
speaker2: why is it here?
speaker1: because someone thought it might be needed.
speaker2: but they died.

speaker1: yes. what would you like for breakfast? 
speaker2: pears.
speaker1: pears it is.
speaker2: is it okay for us to take it?
speaker1: they'd want us to.
speaker1: these will be the best pears you ever tasted. the best. you just wait.
speaker1: too sweet.

speaker1: go ahead. don't let it get cold. 
speaker2: what do i eat first?
speaker1: whatever you like.
speaker2: is this coffee?
speaker1: that's right. careful it's hot.
speaker2: we did good, didn't we papa?
speaker1: yeah, we did good.

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: don't touch my stuff.

speaker1: what do you think? 
speaker2: nice and warm.

speaker1: how do i look? 
speaker2: weird. won't you be cold?

speaker1: can i try some? 
speaker2: no. you won't like it. makes you feel funny.
speaker2: you think i come from another world, don't you? filled with all these strange things you've never seen.
speaker1: sort of.

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: shh.
speaker3: maybe it's a dog.
speaker4: it's not a dog.
speaker1: it is! it's a dog! a dog!

speaker1: if it's a dog it'll be with someone. 
speaker2: who?
speaker1: i don't know.
speaker1: i'm not waiting to find out. come on. let's get out of here.
speaker2: i don't want to go.
speaker1: i know but it's not safe anymore.

speaker1: what are we going to do with all this stuff? 
speaker2: we'll just have to take what we can.
speaker1: i wish we could live here. and we could keep the dog and the dog could catch food for us.

speaker1: look, there is no dog, okay? i'm sorry but there just isn't. 
speaker2: well what is it!
speaker1: i don't know what it is!
speaker2: please papa.
speaker1: no.
speaker2: just say it's going to be all right, papa. say it. just say it, please.
speaker1: listen, trouble comes when you least expect it. so maybe the thing to do is to just always expect it.
speaker2: do you always expect it? papa?
speaker1: i do, yes.
speaker2: you always think bad things are going to happen but we found this place. maybe we'll find another place like this at the coast.
speaker1: maybe.

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: we'll have to cover our tracks from now on.

speaker1: i think they're following us. 
speaker2: who?
speaker1: i don't know.
speaker2: you think it's bad guys?
speaker1: probably.
speaker2: what if it's good guys?

speaker1: i don't have anything for you. you can look if you want. i got nothing. 
speaker2: we're not robbers.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: i said we're not robbers.
speaker1: what are you?
speaker2: we're just like you.
speaker1: what are you following me for?
speaker2: we're not following you.
speaker3: we've got food we could give him.

speaker1: he's not getting any food. the old man looks away, avoiding their eyes. 
speaker2: he's scared, papa.
speaker1: everybody's scared.
speaker2: please papa.

speaker1: if this is an ambush, he goes first. 
speaker2: take it. here.
speaker2: what about a spoon?
speaker1: he's not getting a spoon.
speaker2: eat it. it's good.

speaker1: look, papa. he's hungry. 
speaker2: i see it. and i know what you're going to ask me. and the answer is no.
speaker1: what's the question?
speaker2: we can't keep him.
speaker2: when did you last eat?
speaker2: do you want to eat with us?
speaker3: i don't know. what do i have to do?
speaker2: tell us where the world went.
speaker3: what?
speaker2: you don't have to do anything. can you walk okay?
speaker3: i can walk.

speaker1: don't hold his hand. 
speaker2: he can't see.
speaker1: don't.
speaker1: how old are you?
speaker3: i'm ninety.
speaker1: ninety my ass! is that what you tell people? so they don't hurt you?
speaker3: uh-huh.
speaker1: does it work?
speaker3: nope.
speaker1: what's your name?
speaker3: ely.
speaker1: just "ely?"
speaker3: what's wrong with "ely?"

speaker1: how come you're still alive? what do you eat? 
speaker2: i don't know. people give you things.
speaker1: no they don't.
speaker2: you did.
speaker1: i didn't. he did.
speaker2: are you a little boy?
speaker1: what does he look like?
speaker2: i don't know. i can't see real good.
speaker1: is that right? can you see me?
speaker2: no. but i can tell somebody's there.
speaker3: okay. you need to sleep. come on.
speaker2: i had a little boy once. gone... all gone...
speaker1: what happened to him?

speaker1: i can't... i can't talk about that... leastways not with you i can't. 
speaker2: you can see that, right? okay. tell me now. you're not a shill for a pack of road agents?
speaker1: i'm not anything. i'll go if you want me to. i can find the road.
speaker1: i live like an animal. you don't want to know the things i've had to eat. when i saw that boy i thought i'd died and he was an angel. i never thought i'd see a child again. i never thought that would happen to me.
speaker2: he is an angel. to me he's a
speaker1: well i hope that's not true. to be on the road with the last surviving would be a pretty frightening experience.
speaker2: why do you say that?
speaker1: where men can't live, gods can't either. the road gangs would tear you limb from limb, both of you.
speaker1: i knew this was coming. this or something like it.

speaker1: there were warnings. people thought it was a con - i always believed in it. 
speaker2: did you try to get ready for it?
speaker1: no. what would you do? even if you knew what to do you wouldn't know what to do. suppose you were the last man left alive?
speaker2: how would you know if you were the last man alive?
speaker1: i don't guess you would know it.
speaker2: maybe would know.
speaker1: if there is a up there he would have turned his back on us by now. whoever made humanity will find no humanity here.
speaker2: do you ever wish you would die?
speaker1: no. it's foolish to ask for luxuries in times like these.

speaker1: maybe i should and maybe i shouldn't. i wouldn't have given you anything. 
speaker2: he's going to die and you don't care.
speaker3: i care enough. maybe when we're out of food you'll have more time to think about it.
speaker2: you always say watch out for bad guys but that old man wasn't a bad guy and you can't even tell anymore.

speaker1: what's wrong? 
speaker2: i had a bad dream.
speaker1: what about?
speaker2: i don't want to tell you. just you.
speaker1: what happened to me?
speaker1: i tell him: when you dream about bad things happening it shows you're still fighting. you're still alive. it's when you start to dream about good things you should start to worry.

speaker1: do you think they're still following us? 
speaker2: i think they've been following us for a long time.
speaker3: maybe it's ely - the old man?
speaker2: how? on a broom stick?

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: more smoke. i think we should take a look.
speaker1: i don't want to. let's just keep going.
speaker2: whoever it is i don't want them behind us.
speaker1: what if they're bad guys?
speaker2: what if they're good guys?
speaker2: look. whoever it is out there, it's better to know about it than to not know.
speaker1: why?
speaker2: because we don't like surprises.

speaker1: you know where we are? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: where do you think?
speaker1: more.
speaker2: here?
speaker1: no. we're closer than you think.
speaker1: this is us. this is all sea.
