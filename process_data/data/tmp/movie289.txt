speaker1: daniel, what's wrong? did you break your ankle? 
speaker1: oh my

speaker1: taillights in five minutes. what we can't carry -- 
speaker2: -- we burn. i know the drill.

speaker1: florida's clear. i sent a letter to the school and there's nothing in the papers. 
speaker2: i didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.

speaker1: new ids. 
speaker2: just when i think you can't get any less original, you lower the bar.
speaker1: i'm not interested in originality. i'm interested in untraceable. there are 335,321 john smiths in the united states.

speaker1: it's been so long since the last scar. 
speaker2: you got lulled into a false sense of security. that's my fault.
speaker1: i liked florida. i liked having friends. i liked feeling normal.
speaker2: i wish that you could have a normal life -- but you can't.
speaker1: then why fake it? why not just go hole up in the wilderness.
speaker2: that's exactly what number 3 did.

speaker1: it's from an african news site. a man and his son went missing two nights ago. the locals think they were taken by strange beasts. 
speaker2: piken.
speaker1: the mogadorians are natural-born hunters. blending in is our best protection.
speaker2: so we just keep moving from town to town?
speaker1: until i say otherwise -- yes.
speaker2: i want to be from someplace, henri.
speaker1: you are.
speaker2: lorien's your home, i don't even remember it.
speaker1: like it or not, it's your home too. you have a responsibility to those who died.
speaker2: i want a say in where we live. you already picked it, didn't you?
speaker3: henri revs the engine to life.
speaker1: cheer up, you're going to be living in paradise.

speaker1: she looks even perkier than the realtor in florida. 
speaker2: what's your name?
speaker1: john smith.
speaker2: where are you from, john?
speaker1: arizona.
speaker2: why did you move to paradise?
speaker1: because you're an

speaker1: because my dad needs peace and quiet to research his book. 
speaker2: this was a lot easier when you were

speaker1: here we are. home sweet home. 
speaker1: first impressions?
speaker2: it's perfect.
speaker3: that's one word for it.
speaker1: i feel your pain. i have a daughter his age. apparently, i ruin her life on a daily basis.
speaker3: this guy was covering a hole in my wall.
speaker1: i told the handyman to patch that before you arrived. i'm so sorry.

speaker1: don't you worry about it. 
speaker2: we'll knock it off the rent. keep the poster, bernie kosar brings good luck here in the buckeye state.

speaker1: that's the last of them. i'm hitting the sack. 
speaker2: i need a new photo first.
speaker2: say paradise.
speaker2: i've imputed the new search words: daniel jones. big pine key. sunset high school. you think of any others?
speaker1: yeah, this place
speaker3: henri swivels to face him.
speaker2: if there's a story or picture of you on the internet, this program will find it. our enemy doesn't know who you are -- i want to keep it that way.
speaker1: sand dollar beach, that's where we were jet skiing.

speaker1: he's starving, doesn't have any collar or tags. 
speaker2: must have been dumped.

speaker1: you know, another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldn't be a bad thing. 
speaker2: what are you going to call him?
speaker1: since i need all the luck i can get -- how about bernie kosar?

speaker1: wow. you outdid yourself. what's up? 
speaker1: i already have a backpack.
speaker2: this one has five days of rations, spare clothes, cash and a handheld gps. keep it with you at all times.
speaker1: henri, come on.
speaker2: game's changed. you're in the crosshairs now. you have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice. with or without me.

speaker1: bernie, what the hell... were you hiding in the car? 
speaker2: hey, i was about to take a picture of the little guy.

speaker1: he's not supposed to be here. 
speaker1: go home. now.
speaker2: he's really well-trained. how long have you had him?
speaker1: sorry about your shot.
speaker2: no worries.
speaker2: you just moved into the house on old mill road. it's john, right?
speaker3: john swings back, concerned.
speaker2: don't worry, i'm not stalking you. my mom said she rented it to a guy with a son my age. since i know every other face on this quad, that had to be you.
speaker2: i'm sarah.
speaker2: where are you from?
speaker1: someplace warmer.
speaker2: i don't think that qualifies as an actual answer.
speaker1: i need to register. she raises her camera to snap a shot of him.
speaker1: whoa. what are you doing?
speaker2: capturing your first day, even though you're technically six weeks late.
speaker1: please don't point that at me.
speaker2: afraid the camera's going to steal your soul?
speaker1: what's your problem? i said no.
speaker2: it's only for the yearbook.

speaker1: welcome to paradise, irony not included. 
speaker2: his name's mark jayne. quarterback, sheriff's son, he's three years into the best four years of his life.
speaker2: do yourself a favor -- stay off his radar.
speaker3: didn't know i was on it.
speaker2: you were talking to sarah harte.
speaker3: she was talking to me.
speaker2: mark and sarah have been exclusive since freshmen year.

speaker1: if there's another guy in her airspace, he shoots them down. you got a warning shot. 
speaker2: maybe i'll fire back next time.
speaker1: look, you're new, so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater. football players are gods -- the rest of us are mere mortals. if you want to survive, keep your head down and don't make waves.
speaker2: you sound like my dad.
speaker1: obviously a wise man.
speaker1: i'm sam by the way.
speaker2: thanks for the download.

speaker1: enough! hit the showers. 
speaker1: lebron, grab a broom.

speaker1: the dog is studying him with his head cocked. 
speaker2: let's keep this our little secret.

speaker1: first day here and you're already destroying school property. so much for not making waves. 
speaker2: it was an accident.
speaker1: i hear the real spectator sport was mark and sarah's blowout.
speaker1: dude, you okay?
speaker2: fine.
speaker3: you got a problem?
speaker2: line starts back there.
speaker3: football players get priority.

speaker1: where's that posted? 
speaker2: unwritten rule.
speaker2: i'm surprised your boyfriend didn't tell you.
speaker2: if you don't know your place around here, things can get rough.
speaker1: in that case, i guess i better ask you where i should sit. i was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your girlfriend.
speaker2: you want to talk trash? let's see you back it up.

speaker1: dude, hold up! 
speaker1: you look like crap. i'll get the nurse.

speaker1: calm down. you're going to be okay. 
speaker2: on what planet is this okay?
speaker1: yours.
speaker1: i need to get you out of here.

speaker1: okay, start talking. what the hell's going on? 
speaker2: your first legacy is starting to manifest.
speaker1: legacy?
speaker2: an extraordinary ability. yours is called lumen. they start a lot sooner on lorien. i was beginning to fear yours would never emerge.
speaker1: you knew this was going to happen?
speaker2: i didn't want to worry you. you were already under enough pressure.
speaker2: i'm sorry.

speaker1: whoa. 
speaker2: open it.
speaker1: what are they?
speaker2: crystals from lorien's core. they'll guide us in your training.

speaker1: our solar system. 
speaker1: that's what lorien looked like thousands of years ago. we had all the problems that earth has today. the planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly lorien began to heal itself -- that's when the legacies started.
speaker1: only a select few developed these abilities. they became known as the garde.
speaker2: that's what i am?
speaker1: like your parents and grandparents.
speaker2: the other children in the ship...
speaker1: they're garde as well. once you've mastered your legacies, we'll find them and face the mogadorians together.

speaker1: what legacy do you have? 
speaker2: i don't have any and never will. i'm your cepan -- a teacher. my job is not just to protect you but to train you.
speaker2: give me your hand.
speaker2: trust me.
speaker2: you feel that?
speaker1: ouch.
speaker2: when we're done, your entire body will be shielded against fire.
speaker2: you'll get other legacies too.
speaker1: flying would be cool.
speaker2: you don't get to pick them off a menu.
speaker2: mogs don't knock.

speaker1: it's a girl. 
speaker2: how'd you do it?
speaker3: do what?
speaker2: eviscerate the entire senior class?
speaker2: i was in the darkroom before lunch and they were hanging on the line smiling and looking forward to the future. when i got back, i found 15 rolls of negatives wiped clean.
speaker3: i don't know what you're talking about.
speaker2: so you weren't in the darkroom today?
speaker3: no.
speaker2: here's a tip. if you're going to lie, don't leave a big red backpack at the scene of the crime.

speaker1: i don't know what happened. maybe it's a sign that you should invest in a digital camera. 
speaker2: digital film tells the truth. clearly, i'm not going to get that from you.

speaker1: everything okay? 
speaker2: she was returning my backpack.
speaker1: i think you should stay home from school for a couple of days.
speaker2: i'm fine.
speaker1: just to be safe.

speaker1: i'm going for a run. 
speaker1: sorry, buddy, you couldn't keep up.

speaker1: i think you have the wrong room. 
speaker2: wanted to apologize.
speaker1: does the apology come with an explanation?
speaker1: wait.
speaker1: how about we delete monday and start over?
speaker1: i'm sarah.
speaker2: john.
speaker1: nice gloves.

speaker1: you know all these people? 
speaker2: curse of a small town. i've been around them my whole life. kim thomas. she peed in her bed at a sleepover when we were seven.
speaker2: neil bailey. president of the debate club. plays five instruments. doesn't know he's gay yet.
speaker2: mrs. ross. ap english. she's been here so long, she taught my mom and my four brothers. i'm the baby of the family in case you were wondering.
speaker2: so what's your story?
speaker1: not very interesting.
speaker2: determined to keep the mystery alive, aren't you?
speaker1: you first.
speaker2: okay. recovering cheerleader. wannabe vegetarian but i still love burgers. dreams of being a photojournalist.
speaker2: i've never actually admitted that last one to anybody before.

speaker1: your secret's safe with me. 
speaker2: you ever feel you don't belong in your own life?
speaker1: every single day.
speaker2: wow. that almost sounded like a straight answer.
speaker3: what's he doing in here?
speaker2: i thought you were on two-a-days.
speaker3: coach wants me to rest my arm before the scouts come. you didn't answer my question?
speaker2: john was helping me move some boards.
speaker1: i'm going to take off.
speaker3: seriously, sarah, what's up with this guy?
speaker2: i don't have time for this, mark.
speaker3: but you had time to go to his house the other night.

speaker1: you were following me? 
speaker2: just trying to figure out what's going on with you.
speaker1: you've crossed so many lines i can't even speak to you right now.
speaker2: this isn't over.

speaker1: nice freakout the other day. 
speaker2: wasn't feeling well.

speaker1: told you it wasn't over. 
speaker2: assholes.

speaker1: that sensation you're feeling -- remember it. 
speaker1: show's over.

speaker1: i raided lost and found. 
speaker1: i know. nobody loses anything cool.
speaker1: dude, the way you thrashed mark back there. awesome move.
speaker2: who's in the picture?
speaker1: my dad. my real dad. i took it the summer before he split.

speaker1: he dragged me and my mom all over the yucatan. he was looking for evidence of ancient astronauts. 
speaker2: sounds like a fun vacation.
speaker1: i know. insane. he called himself an anthropologist even though he only made it through one semester of college.
speaker1: always thought he'd come back one day -- who was i kidding. the guy's a joke.

speaker1: john. 
speaker1: i heard about the lockers. i'm sorry.
speaker2: i'll live.
speaker1: i broke up with mark.
speaker1: i've been thinking about doing it for a while... today just finally pushed me over the edge.
speaker3: he studies her face.
speaker2: why are you telling me?
speaker1: i don't know.
speaker2: you made the right call.
speaker1: halloween block party's tonight.
speaker2: i saw the banners.
speaker1: i'll be on main street hiding behind my camera if you want to swing by.
speaker1: i wasn't expecting an actual response. i could text you later. do they have cell phones on planet john?
speaker4: wasn't that your friend from the other night?
speaker2: her name's sarah.
speaker2: i didn't ask for a ride home.
speaker4: principal called. said there was an incident.
speaker5: john stares out the window, guilty.
speaker2: a guy was messing with me. i took care of it. problem solved.
speaker4: you're stronger and faster because of earth's gravity -- you shouldn't use that advantage to settle petty scores.
speaker2: it was no big deal. don't blow it out of proportion.
speaker4: you can't risk everything over wounded pride.
speaker2: i wasn't looking for a fight. it just happened. get off my back.
speaker4: article says it was arson.
speaker2: we were clean. there's no way the mogs can track us here.
speaker4: they can track us anywhere. i think it's time you saw what you're really up against.

speaker1: this is your cepan. go with him. 
speaker2: no!
speaker3: your life is my life now. i will always protect you.
speaker1: he must survive.

speaker1: i saw my grandfather. i saw what you did to the mogadorians -- you saved my life. 
speaker2: a lot of lorics sacrificed their lives so that you could live.
speaker3: john is still trying to process the memory.
speaker1: he said i must survive.
speaker2: the elders had a plan. you weren't on that ship by chance. the nine of you were chosen for a reason. even if only two of you live, together you'll pose a grave threat to our enemy.
speaker1: you saw what they did to lorien. how can nine or six or two of us take on that army? it's hopeless.
speaker2: i never thought we'd get off lorien alive -- but we did. i didn't know how we could survive on a strange planet -- but we have. i gave us six months before the mogs found us -- it's been 10 years. don't give up now.
speaker2: you have the potential to do great things. even if you don't see it -- i do.
speaker1: how can you put so much faith in me?
speaker2: because your life is my life. if you quit, then everything i've worked for and sacrificed is meaningless.
speaker2: remember -- nothing is inevitable.

speaker1: it's sarah. the block party's tonight. i'll say i can't make it. 
speaker2: no... go.
speaker2: you've had enough for one day.

speaker1: you work here? 
speaker2: not by choice. ed's my stepdad. he's under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn, they'll suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods.
speaker2: i put those on special tonight for any wannabe jason voorhees.

speaker1: screw this. let me lock up. i'll hang with you. 
speaker2: what about your stepdad?
speaker1: he hit the tavern at 6:00. he's already hammered by now. i'll probably find him passed out on the doorstep. every night is trick ã¢â€â˜r treat at my house.

speaker1: she's over there. 
speaker2: you made it. like the t-shirt, sam.
speaker1: guidance counsellor said i need to set goals for myself. figured i'd aim high.
speaker2: what do you think of halloween in paradise?
speaker3: they should pull out all the stops next year.
speaker2: well, you haven't had the full experience until you've been on the haunted hayride.

speaker1: give me a sec. 
speaker2: i'm impressed.
speaker1: you guys ready?
speaker2: three on a wagon might get a little crowded. i'll meet you two on the other side.
speaker1: sam's cool.
speaker3: definitely unique.
speaker1: i haven't really talked to him since 8th grade. mark had a tight circle. if you weren't a jock or cheerleader, you didn't exist.
speaker3: i'm glad you broke free.
speaker1: me too.

speaker1: not even a flinch. none of this scares you, does it? 
speaker2: i'm trembling on the inside.
speaker1: you can smile. i was starting to have my doubts.

speaker1: hell's gate, everybody off. 
speaker2: once we make it through, we're home free.

speaker1: what was that? 
speaker2: just part of the ride.
speaker1: are you sure?

speaker1: help! somebody! 
speaker2: sarah?

speaker1: you're blinding me! stop! 
speaker2: where's sarah? tell me!!
speaker1: shepherd falls. now turn off that flashlight!

speaker1: are you crazy! where's john? 
speaker2: relax. it's a practical joke.
speaker1: i swear if you hurt him --
speaker2: why do you give a
speaker1: get out of my face, mark, you're pathetic.
speaker2: i'm the best thing that ever happened to you and i'm giving you one more chance.
speaker2: don't walk away from me!
speaker3: back off!
speaker1: john! are you okay?
speaker2: where the are kevin and joe?

speaker1: they got spooked. 
speaker2: hey, those are police property!
speaker2: i'm going to kill you!
speaker3: john! stop!
speaker3: that's his throwing arm!
speaker3: football's all he's got.
speaker3: john! wait.
speaker3: i'm sorry, i didn't want you to break his arm.
speaker1: i'm not mad at you. i'm mad at myself.

speaker1: i had no idea mark would pull something like that. he has seriously gone off the deep end. 
speaker2: the guy's in love with you. wants you back.
speaker1: that's not love.
speaker1: walk me home?

speaker1: this is me. 
speaker1: i know. wait until the christmas decorations go up. my mom decks the halls with so many lights, you can see our house from space.
speaker1: you should see a doctor.
speaker2: for this? wouldn't waste their time.
speaker1: you're not going to tell me how you took out those football players, are you?
speaker3: he says nothing. she smiles.
speaker1: i really don't get you.
speaker1: but i feel like i can trust you.
speaker2: you can.
speaker1: good night.
speaker2: wait.

speaker1: i heard on the police scanner that eight boys were beaten up in the woods tonight. 
speaker2: they won't talk.
speaker1: that was a stupid thing to do.
speaker2: they attacked me. if i hadn't defended myself, i'd be in the er right now. would that have been the better choice?
speaker2: you've got to start trusting me!

speaker1: i was getting to that. i got a new legacy. 
speaker2: telekinesis. that's a big step. must have been triggered by the fight.
speaker2: i need to teach you how to control these abilities. we'll start working on that tomorrow.

speaker1: what is it? 
speaker2: we got a hit on one of the search words.
speaker2: it's a paranormal blog. ã¢â€âœthey walk among us!ã¢â€â
speaker1: that's sand dollar beach.
speaker2: looks like a cell phone camera. there's enough for the mogs to id your face.
speaker1: can you take it down?
speaker2: working on it.
speaker1: i'm sorry, henri.
speaker2: this isn't your fault. there's still nothing to trace us here.
speaker2: this could take all night. get some sleep.

speaker1: i've narrowed it down to three possibilities: you're a genetic experiment, you're a freak of nature, or you're an extraterrestrial. 
speaker2: i don't know what you think happened tonight...
speaker1: your hands lit up like a firefly on crack, you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies, and you took off faster than an olympic runner.

speaker1: did i leave anything out? 
speaker2: what do you want from me?
speaker1: i just want to know who you are.
speaker2: i'm a survivor from a planet called lorien.
speaker1: your dad... he's from there too?
speaker2: henri's not my dad. he's my guardian. if he found out you knew about us, we'd be gone by morning.
speaker2: i don't want to leave paradise.
speaker1: i won't tell anyone.
speaker1: there's something i want to show you.

speaker1: mom figured he was having an affair and took off. all these years i thought she was right. now you're here. 
speaker2: that doesn't prove anything.
speaker1: it proves he wasn't crazy. i'm starting to think that he didn't bail on us... that maybe something else happened out there -- that he was taken.
speaker1: guess the bar closed.
speaker3: sam! where are you?
speaker3: you think i wouldn't hear you locked up early!
speaker2: you going to be okay?
speaker1: if he finds you here, it'll be worse.
speaker1: go.

speaker1: you look wiped. 
speaker2: i wasn't the only who was up last night.
speaker1: sarah texted me. i went over to her house.
speaker2: i've tried every trick i know, but i can't crack that blog's firewall.
speaker1: there must be a way.
speaker2: we need to find where the site's located and take it offline manually. the url source has been run through a labyrinth of servers, it could take weeks to track down.
speaker1: i want to help.
speaker2: you can. get changed.

speaker1: i don't see any family pictures around. i guess the photo aversion is hereditary. 
speaker1: your mom... grandparents. is there anyone else in your life?
speaker2: they died.
speaker1: i'm sorry.
speaker2: it was a long time ago. it's just me and my dad now.

speaker1: i get the feeling he doesn't like me very much. 
speaker2: it takes him a while to warm up to people.
speaker1: thanksgiving's tomorrow. why don't you bring your dad and celebrate with us?
speaker2: i don't know. are there going to be a lot of people?
speaker1: a tsunami of relatives. but don't worry, i'll shield you from the wave. besides, i want everyone to meet you.
speaker3: i've found the --
speaker2: just giving bernie a quick bath.
speaker3: you're clearly putting a lot of effort into it.
speaker1: i better hit the road.
speaker1: see you tomorrow. twoish.
speaker1: bye, mr. smith.

speaker1: i finally tracked the location of that blog. it's a house in warsaw, indiana. about four hours from here. i'm heading up there tomorrow. 
speaker2: sarah invited us to thanksgiving.
speaker1: send my regrets.
speaker2: you shouldn't go alone. it could be dangerous.
speaker1: i won't risk taking you. i'll leave early and be back by five.
speaker2: don't you ever get lonely?
speaker1: how could i? i have you.
speaker2: you know what i mean. all these years, there's never been anyone.
speaker1: we aren't like humans. once we fall in love, it's for life. the pain of separation is unbearable.

speaker1: anastasia. 
speaker2: you left her to save me.
speaker1: you're not responsible for what happened to her -- they are.
speaker1: i looked at her the way you look at sarah.
speaker1: she can't come with us when we leave -- and we always have to leave, you know that.
speaker1: i was hoping to protect you from that pain.
speaker2: you can't protect me from everything.

speaker1: you look dazed. 
speaker2: just taking it all in.
speaker1: i'm glad you came.
speaker3: don't mind me.
speaker3: let's get a picture of you two lovebirds.
speaker1: mom. no. john really doesn't like having his --
speaker2: it's okay. let her take it.

speaker1: henri? 
speaker1: henri?

speaker1: who are you? where's henri? 
speaker1: i need your help.

speaker1: john! 
speaker2: it's henri. i have to go. sorry.
speaker2: thanks. i owe you.
speaker3: anything to get out of thanksgiving at my house.
speaker3: i checked out that blog on the way over. saw the video. what was the deal with your ankle?
speaker2: death scars.
speaker3: they kind of look like the symbols in my dad's research.
speaker3: you guys don't --
speaker2: abduct people? no.
speaker3: how about the ones you said were hunting you?
speaker2: they're capable of anything.
speaker2: we need to get to warsaw -- now.

speaker1: number 417. henri tracked the url to that house. 
speaker2: i don't see his suv anywhere.
speaker1: he would have parked it across town.
speaker2: stole it from ed.
speaker2: let's move.
speaker1: i called you because i needed a ride, not a sidekick. if i could have run here, i would have.
speaker1: go home. i'll call you when i get back.

speaker1: see anything? 
speaker2: i told you to go!
speaker1: they might know where my dad is!
speaker3: it's lying on the counter by the fridge.
speaker2: henri's here.
speaker1: wait! other than strength, speed and night-light, what powers have you got?
speaker2: telekinesis -- but that's a work in progress.
speaker1: no invisibility, x-ray vision, flight?
speaker2: sam, we drove here.
speaker1: okay. i'm ready. let's do it.

speaker1: hurry up. hurry up. hurry up. 
speaker1: you just dead bolted it! way to go!
speaker2: new plan -- follow lucky strike. text me if he comes back.

speaker1: you shouldn't be here. 
speaker2: your life is my life, remember?
speaker1: i talked my way in. thought the big guy was buying it.

speaker1: i was asking him about the video when the other one shot me from behind... some sort of animal tranq. 
speaker1: i'm getting rusty.

speaker1: we have to leave! 
speaker1: henri!

speaker1: stay planted or i'll blow your friend's head off. 
speaker2: he came to help.

speaker1: sam looks over at john, impressed. 
speaker2: you're the one from the video! you're the one they're after.
speaker3: tell me what you know!
speaker3: start talking!
speaker2: i don't know what they're called. the one in the red coat said he'd kill me if i didn't do what he wanted.
speaker4: the mogadorians... they've been here?
speaker2: he told me to call if anyone came asking about the video.
speaker3: did you?
speaker2: they wanted me to hold your friend until they got here.
speaker4: we need to go! now!

speaker1: sam, get us out of here! 
speaker2: i must have dropped the keys!
speaker3: start the engine.
speaker1: i can't.
speaker3: yes, you can.

speaker1: i called you like i said. it's not my fault they got away! 
speaker2: where did they go?
speaker3: his accent is thick and his voice is unnerving.
speaker1: how should i know? the kid had me pinned to the ceiling.
speaker2: where did they go?

speaker1: we'll meet you back at the house. 
speaker2: we're not going back to paradise.
speaker2: thank you for your help, but you'll never see us again.
speaker3: is he serious?
speaker3: what am i supposed to tell people?

speaker1: nothing. forget about us. we never existed. 
speaker1: goodbye, sam.

speaker1: we leave at nightfall. 
speaker2: henri, this is insane. they still don't know where we live.
speaker1: it's only a matter of time. they know our faces. they saw sam. how long has he known?
speaker2: since halloween.
speaker1: i trusted you and you lied to me! john bows his head, can't meet henri's gaze.
speaker2: only because i knew how you'd react and i didn't want to leave paradise.

speaker1: now we don't have a choice. the mogs are using humans to trap us. from this point on -- no more towns. no more schools. we're going off the grid until we find the others. 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: this isn't a discussion.
speaker2: i'm not leaving without saying goodbye to sarah.
speaker1: let. me. down.
speaker1: give me your phone and ids.
speaker1: john smith dies today.

speaker1: the chief wants to send the morgue boys in and seal this tomb. 
speaker2: hope they haven't had lunch yet. these guys were gutted from the inside out.

speaker1: who the are you? 
speaker1: how'd you get in?
speaker1: hey, we've got a live one down here.

speaker1: where is he, sam? 
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: what happened last night? i've tried calling him all day. but his number's no longer in service.
speaker2: forget about him, sarah.
speaker1: i'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.
speaker2: he left with henri and he isn't coming back. ever.
speaker2: i'm sorry.

speaker1: little late for dessert. 
speaker2: i need to talk to sarah.
speaker1: she's not here. some friends dragged her to a party at mark jayne's.
speaker1: i don't usually pry into my daughter's love life, i certainly didn't want my mother in mine -- but sarah's my youngest and she's special to me.
speaker2: she's special to me too.

speaker1: you weren't invited. 
speaker2: where's sarah?
speaker1: she doesn't want to see you.

speaker1: everybody upstairs! kevin's going for the beer bong record! 
speaker2: onto the white rug.

speaker1: i'm sorry about last night. she pulls away, her relief turning to anger. 
speaker2: no. not good enough. sam said you were never coming back. what are you doing here?
speaker1: i couldn't leave without seeing you one last time.
speaker2: so it's true. what's going on? what kind of trouble are you and your dad in?
speaker1: we're going to be fine.
speaker2: damnit! whatever it is, i'll understand -- just tell me the truth.
speaker1: the truth is i'm not who you think i am. you need to forget about me.
speaker2: why are you acting like this?
speaker1: because it's the only way to keep you safe.
speaker2: safe from what? he turns away, shields her from his torment.
speaker1: goodbye, sarah.

speaker1: where's sarah? 
speaker2: went back for dozer.

speaker1: john! 
speaker1: dozer's under the bed. he's too scared to come out!
speaker2: don't let go of him. i promise i won't let go of you.
speaker3: as he lifts them...

speaker1: you okay? 
speaker2: you walked through that fire without getting burned. i saw you stop that beam.
speaker1: i'll explain everything... but not here... sarah... please?

speaker1: please don't look at me like that. 
speaker2: i'm sorry. i'm still trying to process everything i saw and i keep coming to the same conclusion -- what you did isn't possible.
speaker1: it is for me.
speaker2: who are you? for once please tell me the truth.
speaker1: my name isn't john. i don't have a name, just a number. 4. in fact, my whole life can be reduced to numbers: like 15 million -- that's how many light years it takes to get from my planet to earth. 38 -- that's how many towns i've lived in. or 3,671 -- that's how many days i've been running from an enemy that wants me dead. i lied to you, sarah, because i lie to everyone. that's how i stay alive.
speaker1: i shouldn't be telling you any of this. it's dangerous.

speaker1: i don't care. i just want to be with you. 
speaker2: i want that too. but if i stay you could get hurt. i have to leave to keep you safe.
speaker1: there's something i want to give you first.

speaker1: where are we going? is this about the fire? it was an accident. 
speaker2: only now do we reverse to reveal

speaker1: we're hunting for one of the guests at your party. 
speaker1: do you know this boy?
speaker2: yeah, john smith. but i didn't invite him.
speaker1: he's a fugitive. we've been tracking him for some time.
speaker2: i'll help you find him.
speaker2: he's not at sarah's, i already checked. and one of my dad's deputies drove by his house -- nada.
speaker1: he poses a great threat to us. where else could he be?
speaker2: i've got sarah's cell number, maybe you guys can trace it?
speaker1: tell me everything you know about john smith.

speaker1: john's not at the house. is he here? 
speaker2: no, but he's all over the internet.
speaker1: i know.
speaker2: those things from warsaw -- they're coming, aren't they?
speaker1: go back inside. this isn't your fight.
speaker2: the it isn't. i'm coming with you.

speaker1: hello. 
speaker1: it's henri.

speaker1: where are you? 
speaker2: high school.
speaker1: get out now!
speaker2: too late... they're here.

speaker1: what the hell's in there? 
speaker1: you guys aren't fbi.

speaker1: you oughta keep your heroics off the internet. 
speaker2: who the are you?
speaker1: number 6. where's your cepan?
speaker2: on his way. where's yours?
speaker1: dead. the mogs got her four months ago. we had been tracking them.
speaker2: tracking them?
speaker1: we discovered they plan to attack earth. the only thing standing in their way is the six of us.
speaker1: you know what that means?
speaker2: the war starts tonight.
speaker1: first we have to get out of here alive and find the others.

speaker1: what are we up against? 
speaker2: there's a commander, a bunch of soldiers and two piken. they'll have all the main entrances covered.
speaker3: the gym, there's a tunnel under the stage.
speaker1: it'll take us out to the stadium.
speaker3: we're invisible.
speaker1: you got any other legacies?
speaker2: i can control the elements. you?
speaker1: lumen and telekinesis.

speaker1: stay put. they want to draw you out. 
speaker2: he's not dying because of me!

speaker1: barricade the doors! 
speaker2: what are you doing with them?
speaker3: they said they were fbi. that john was a fugitive. what the hell's going on?
speaker1: you've stumbled into a war. so shut up and keep your head down.
speaker4: i see age hasn't mellowed your attitude, 6.
speaker3: i didn't know they were trying to kill you. i'm sorry.

speaker1: this isn't your fault -- it's mine. 
speaker2: what is it, boy?
speaker3: he's telling us to run!

speaker1: bernie's a chimera. he came with us from lorien. 
speaker2: guess i wasn't the only one keeping secrets.
speaker1: somebody had to watch you when i wasn't around.

speaker1: where's john? 
speaker2: right behind us.

speaker1: they've blocked it. use your telekinesis. 
speaker2: we're not leaving without my friends.
speaker1: don't you mean the girl?
speaker1: i broke the elders' spell to find you. the mogs can kill me now. we have to go.
speaker2: we stay and fight.

speaker1: you know how to use one of these? 
speaker2: my dad's the sheriff.
speaker3: save it for the mogs. let's go!

speaker1: she sheathes her dagger and helps john up. 
speaker2: saving your life. my new hobby.

speaker1: henri. 
speaker1: come on, taillights in five.
speaker2: i won't be coming with you this time. save yourself.
speaker1: we go together!

speaker1: number 4. 
speaker1: your cepan saved you on lorien.
speaker1: but this moment was inevitable.
speaker2: nothing is inevitable.

speaker1: john! 
speaker1: john!

speaker1: sorry, girl scout first aid didn't cover extraterrestrial dagger wounds. 
speaker2: thanks.

speaker1: the sheriff's department is starting to put up roadblocks. you guys better get moving. 
speaker2: you good to go?
speaker3: don't worry about me.
speaker2: sam, ride with six.
speaker3: we don't need baggage.
speaker4: i have to find out if the mogs took my dad.
speaker3: you slow us down, i'll shoot you myself.
speaker5: i want to come too.
speaker2: you need to stay here.
speaker5: why?
speaker2: you could have died last night. i'm not putting you in danger again. mark's promised to look after you.
speaker6: tears tumble down her cheeks.
speaker5: i don't want to say goodbye.
speaker2: i'll come back for you.
speaker5: when?
speaker2: when it's safe.
speaker2: where i'm from, we only give our heart to one person. i've given mine to you.
speaker2: i love you, sarah.

speaker1: but i don't regret it. the pain reminds me what's at stake. 
speaker1: we must find the others and face our enemy together. i'm not sure how we can stop them. but nothing is inevitable. i know that now.
speaker1: i am number 4.
