speaker1: can i get back to you on that?

speaker1: i do not want to be here. at all. 
speaker2: this school has boys too.
speaker1: i hate you. even i would think twice about dating a seventeen year old.
speaker2: well, she's only allowed out when the sun is up, so i wouldn't call it dating, more like...

speaker1: playtime? 
speaker2: that doesn't sound so good either.

speaker1: scott! heyyyy! 
speaker2: hey knives, this is my cool gay roommate, wallace wells. he's gay.
speaker1: oh, hi! do you want to know who in my class is gay?
speaker3: yes. does he wear glasses?
speaker2: wallace, you go now! begone!
speaker3: you're too good for him. run.

speaker1: did you know the original name of pac- man was puck-man? you would think it's because pac-man looks like a yellow hockey puck, but actually it comes from the japanese phrase paku-paku which means to flap ones mouth open and closed. they changed it over here because puck-man is too easy to vandalize. you know, scratch out the p and turn it into an or whatever? 
speaker2: ohmigod, like...wow.
speaker1: yeah. wow.
speaker2: oh, i got it!

speaker1: tamara is into this korean guy, bobby, but everyone thinks bobby has a crush on mina. 
speaker2: i thought derek and tamara had a mutual like-each-other thing going, what happened?

speaker1: i don't listen to much music. i know a lot of kids who play piano or whatever, but you guys rock. 
speaker2: i knew i personally rocked, but i never suspected that we rocked as a unit. thank you, knives.

speaker1: i mean, you guys are gonna be huge. 
speaker2: well, we're already pretty big. but it might be cool if cool people wore our t-shirt.

speaker1: excuse me, do you have anything by 'the clash at demonhead'? 
speaker2: have you tried the section marked 'the clash at demonhead'?
speaker3: thank you, julie.
speaker2: are you coming to my party friday or will you be busy babysitting?

speaker1: thank you, julie. 
speaker1: you don't want to listen to her.

speaker1: and you definitely don't want to listen to them. 
speaker2: oh, i heart them so much.
speaker1: i hearted them too until they signed to a major label and the singer turned into a total and ruined my life.
speaker2: envy adams is sooo cool. do you read her blog?
speaker1: sorry, you were saying about me?

speaker1: i mean, i've...i've never gone out with someone so talented. 
speaker2: you go out with a lot of guys?
speaker1: ...no.
speaker2: yeah, so whatever, man!
speaker1: i've never even kissed a guy.
speaker2: me neither.

speaker1: my secret lair is one of those 'no girls allowed' deals. 
speaker2: oh, okay.
speaker1: but do you want to see the house where i grew up?
speaker2: sure.
speaker1: here you go.
speaker2: wow.
speaker1: yeah. wow.

speaker1: oh god...so...so alone. 
speaker2: you're not alone. you're just having some idiotic dream.
speaker1: does that mean we can make out?
speaker1: oh

speaker1: what is it, scott? 
speaker2: i had this totally weird dream.
speaker3: oh
speaker1: what is it, scott?

speaker1: can we skip the dreamtime? color me not interested. 
speaker2: but there was this girl...
speaker3: girl?
speaker1: was this an envy related dream?
speaker3: we don't use the e-word in this house.
speaker2: no, it wasn't her. it was somebody new...
speaker1: yay for that.
speaker3: speaking of new, weren't you supposed to take your fake high school girlfriend to the library a half-hour ago?
speaker2: what? it's like, six in the morning.
speaker2: arrrrgh!

speaker1: libraries remind me of grade school. 
speaker2: that must seem like a reeeeally long time ago.
speaker1: uh. let's talk about something else.
speaker2: do you know that girl?
speaker2: scott?

speaker1: you only played one note for that entire song. 
speaker2: it was...uh...my hand slipped.
speaker3: is your girlfriend distracting you?
speaker2: my girlfriend?
speaker4: i'll... i'll be quieter.
speaker1: let's do that one again.

speaker1: i told you like fifty times! 
speaker2: we're going to this party, retard.
speaker3: party?
speaker4: at julie's.
speaker3: ugh. i thought you guys split.
speaker1: we did. but, you know, there may be some label guys there, so...
speaker3: aw, man. this is going to suck.
speaker2: at least it will give us something to complain about.
speaker3: awww maaan...

speaker1: ...this 
speaker2: 
speaker1: i'm going to go pee due to boredom.
speaker2: i have to pee.

speaker1: hey comeau. 
speaker2: hey scott. some party huh? you gettin' your drink on?

speaker1: this is coke zero. i don't drink. 
speaker2: you don't drink? i remember you getting ridiculously drunk off two gandt's one time and-
speaker1: comeau, you know everyone, right?
speaker2: pretty much.
speaker1: do you know this one girl with hair like this?
speaker2: yeah man. ramona flowers. someone said she was coming tonight actually.

speaker1: hey, what's up? 
speaker2: nothing.
speaker1: hey, you know pacman?
speaker2: i know of him.

speaker1: well you know pac-man was originally puckman but not because pac-man looks like a hockey puck and paku-paku-paku means flapping your mouth and they changed it because if you scratch out the "p" and turn it into an "f'â? you know? 
speaker2: yeah that's amazing.
speaker1: um...am i dreaming?
speaker1: i'll leave you alone forever now.

speaker1: jump cut. scott runs towards comeau. 
speaker2: dude. what do you know about ramona flowers?!
speaker3: all i know is she's american.
speaker2: american...

speaker1: i think she has a boyfriend. 
speaker2: some guy back in new york.
speaker1: doesn't she have the most ridiculous name?
speaker2: i know. it's so 'âœramona quimby, aged 8'â and yet...flowers.
speaker3: yeah. what else?

speaker1: i heard she kicks all kind of ass. 
speaker2: she's on another level.
speaker3: she's got men dying at her feet.
speaker4: she's got some battle scars.
speaker5: not to be entered into lightly
speaker6: what about ramona flowers?
speaker7: you know her? tell me. now.
speaker6: she just moved here. got a job with amazon. comes into my work.
speaker7: does she really?
speaker8: didn't you say she just broke up with someone, jools?

speaker1: did she reeally? 
speaker2: that they had a huge fight or whatever?
speaker1: did they reeeally?
speaker3: ...yes. but i didn't want scott to know that, stephen.

speaker1: yeah, i don't know what it is about that girl, she just- 
speaker2: scott, i forbid you from hitting on ramona. even if you haven't had a real girlfriend in over a year-
speaker3: hey whoa, whoa. scott's mourning period is officially over. he's totally dating a high schooler.
speaker2: dating a high schooler is the mourning period.
speaker3: she's got a point.
speaker1: i thought you guys broke up.
speaker2: i don't want you scaring off the coolest girl at my party scott. we all know you're a total lady killer wannabe jerky jerk.
speaker1: that's garbage! completely untrue.
speaker2: that time with lisa-
speaker1: misunderstanding.
speaker2: that time with hollie-
speaker1: not what it looked like!
speaker2: that time you dumped kim for-
speaker1: hey, me and kim are all good now.
speaker2: whatever, ramona is out of your league, let's leave it at that.

speaker1: and anyway, i'm not even sure she really did have a big breakup. she keeps mentioning some guy named gideon. 
speaker2: yeah, i don't know what it is about that girl, she just-
speaker1: forget it scott!!!

speaker1: guess who's druuunk? 
speaker2: i guess wallace.
speaker1: you guess right.
speaker2: so, that girl. from my dream.
speaker1: girl. okay...
speaker2: i saw her at the library...
speaker1: library...can i pretend we're talking about a guy?
speaker2: so then i'm at this party, and hey!
speaker1: there he is.
speaker2: i think she's...
speaker1: you think he's...
speaker2: i think she's the girl of my dreams.

speaker1: mmm. then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend. 
speaker2: i've never been so sure about something.
speaker1: then you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.
speaker2: what's that?
speaker1: break...up...fake...high school...girlfriend...
speaker2: i'm not getting it, friend.
speaker3: you're thinking of juggling two chicks!?
speaker2: not even!
speaker3: well, you should break up with your fake high school girlfriend.
speaker2: wait. who told you?
speaker3: duh. wallace.
speaker2: he's not even conscious!
speaker3: whatever. you of all people should know how sucky it is to get cheated on.
speaker2: don't you have a job to do?
speaker3: you're right. i should send out a mass text about this. bye.

speaker1: amazon.ca. what's the website for that? 
speaker2: ...amazon.ca.
speaker1: awesome! i have to order something reeeally cool.

speaker2: i'm so happy for you.
speaker1: "dear mr. pilgrim, it has come to my attention that we will be fighting soon. my name is matthew patel, and i'm" blah blah 'âœfair warning'â blah blah...hmm. this is...this is...this is...!!!

speaker3: remember you were supposed to meet me at the bus stop a half-hour ago?
speaker2: how could i possibly forget?

speaker2: that's sucky.

speaker2: great story, man.
speaker3: is there a prize or something?!

speaker2: yeah that's the one.
speaker1: i hate them!
speaker3: oh my gosh, i hate them too!
speaker4: yeah, they suck.

speaker1: hi, um, i was thinking about asking you out, but then i realized how stupid that would be. 
speaker1: do you want to go out sometime?
speaker2: um, no, that's okay. you just have to sign for this alright?
speaker1: i just woke up, and you were in my dream. i dreamt you were delivering me this package. is that weird?
speaker2: it's not weird at all.
speaker1: it's not?
speaker2: no, it's just like, you've got this really convenient subspace highway running through your head that i like to use. it's like three miles in fifteen seconds.
speaker1: right...

speaker1: oh yeah. i forgot you guys don't have that in canada. 
speaker2: you don't remember me do you? i met you at the party the other day.
speaker1: were you the pac-man guy?
speaker2: no. not even. that was some total ass. i was the other guy. you're ramona flowers right?
speaker1: that's me.
speaker2: so, you're like american?
speaker1: why, am i coming off as rude?
speaker2: not at all. noooooo...
speaker1: you know...you need to sign for this. whatever this is?
speaker2: it's something really cool. you'd be impressed.
speaker1: you still have to sign.
speaker2: but if i sign for it, you'll leave.
speaker1: yeah. that's how it works.
speaker2: okay well, can we just maybe just hang out sometime? get to know each other? you're the new kid on the block, right? i've lived here forever. i mean...there are reasons for you to hang out with me?
speaker1: you're all over the place.

speaker1: you are like...my dream girl. 
speaker2: i need to find a new route.
speaker1: either that or you need to start hanging out with me.
speaker2: you want me to hang out with you?
speaker1: um...you know...if that's cool.
speaker2: if i say yes, will you sign for your package?
speaker1: done. so, yeah. eight o'clock?

speaker1: why are you just standing there? 
speaker2: dude, i'm totally waiting on you.
speaker1: sorry, i just assumed you were too cool to be on time.
speaker2: well. you assumed wrong.
speaker1: so what do you want to do? we could get a slice at pizza pizza or flip through some records at sonic boom. oh, or there's this awesome game called ninja ninja revolution at-

speaker1: i'm not into simulated violence. 
speaker2: i'm cool with whatever you want to do.
speaker1: this is good.
speaker2: this is good. so how'd you end up in toronto?
speaker1: just needed to escape i guess.
speaker2: oh yeah?
speaker1: i got this job here. and gideon had always said toronto was one of the great cities so...
speaker2: is gideon...is he your boyfriend?
speaker1: he's...a friend.
speaker2: was he your boyfriend?
speaker1: do you mind if we don't get into that right now?
speaker2: it's so not interesting to me.
speaker1: so what about you? what do you do?
speaker2: i'm between jobs.
speaker1: between what and what?
speaker2: my last job is a long story filled with sighs.

speaker1: i know plenty of those. 
speaker2: is that why you left new york?
speaker1: pretty much. it was time to head somewhere a little more chilled.
speaker2: well, it's certainly chilled here.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker2: i'm totally obsessed with you.
speaker1: i didn't mean to get you obsessed.
speaker2: i just haven't been obsessed with a girl for a long time. it's weird.
speaker1: that's probably because you sleep with a guy.
speaker2: um...
speaker1: i was guessing from your apartment, but you totally do!

speaker1: it's... we're just poor! we can't afford two beds! we're not gay! actually... no... wallace is pretty gay. 
speaker2: dude, relax. i believe you. you're too desperate to be gay.
speaker1: i feel so stupid.
speaker2: aw... you're probably not that stupid.
speaker1: i'm... mostly stupid.
speaker2: well, you're definitely stupid if you want to go out with me.
speaker1: exactly, yeah.
speaker2: this is ridiculous. isn't it like april?
speaker1: yeah. i can barely see you. this whole thing is an unmitigated disaster.
speaker2: i think 'act of god' is a pretty decent excuse for a lousy date.
speaker1: so this is a 'date', eh?
speaker2: did i say 'date'? slip of the tongue.
speaker1: tongue...
speaker2: anyway, night's not over yet. i think there's a thingy up here somewhere.

speaker1: a thingy? 
speaker2: a door.
speaker1: a door? i... i... i can't see you.

speaker1: what kind of tea do you want? 
speaker2: there's more than one kind?
speaker1: we have blueberry, raspberry, ginseng, sleepytime, green tea, green tea with lemon, green tea with lemon and honey, liver disaster, ginger with honey, ginger without honey, vanilla almond, white truffle, blueberry chamomile, vanilla walnut, constant comment and earl grey.
speaker2: did you make some of those up?
speaker1: i think i'll have sleepytime.
speaker2: that sounds good to me.
speaker1: let me get you a blanket.
speaker2: that would actually be awesome.
speaker1: dude! i'm changing.
speaker2: aaah! sorry, i'm just...cold!
speaker1: here, does this help?
speaker2: that's...very warm. what is that?

speaker1: scott opens his eyes to see ramona hugging him. 
speaker2: ohh...kay.
speaker2: were you..were you just going to bring the blanket from your bed?
speaker3: i guess...
speaker2: maybe...maybe we should both get under it...since we're so cold.
speaker3: well...what about our tea?
speaker2: i can...not have tea.
speaker3: i changed my mind.
speaker2: changed it to what? from what?
speaker3: i don't want to have with you, pilgrim. not right now.
speaker2: ohh...kay.
speaker3: it's not like i'm gonna send you home in a snowstorm or anything. you can sleep in my bed. and i reserve the right to change my mind about the later.

speaker1: this is cool, just this. it's been like a really long time, and this is...i think i needed this. 
speaker2: you're welcome.

speaker1: i have to work. 
speaker2: work?
speaker1: you have to leave.

speaker1: hey, can this not be a one night stand? for one thing, i didn't even get any...that was a joke. 
speaker2: what did you have in mind?
speaker1: umm...oh, come to the first round of this battle of the bands thing.
speaker2: you have a band?
speaker1: yeah, we're terrible. please come.

speaker1: wait! can i get your number? 
speaker1: wow, girl number.
speaker2: see you at the show, scott pilgrim.
speaker1: oh, hey! it's tonight...at the-

speaker1: you totally came! 
speaker2: yes. i did totally come.
speaker3: excuse my brother. he's chronically enfeebled. i'm stacey.
speaker2: hey.

speaker1: this is a nightmare. is this a nightmare? wake up, wake up, wake up. 
speaker2: once we're on stage you'll be fine.
speaker3: we were just on stage. for sound check. the sound guy hated us.
speaker4: it's just nerves! pre-show jitters. people love us. right?

speaker1: jimmy. do they rock or 
speaker2: they...haven't started playing yet.
speaker1: that was a test, jimmy. you passed.
speaker3: good evening. i am crash, and these are the boys.

speaker1: this is called "i am so sad. i am so very very sad." and it goes a little something like this. 
speaker1: thank you.

speaker1: this song is for the guy who keeps yelling from the balcony, and it's called "we hate you, please die." 
speaker2: sweet! i love this one!

speaker1: these guys are good. are these guys good? 
speaker1: these guys are good.

speaker1: so, how do you know scott? 
speaker2: he's...um. he's a friend.
speaker1: hard for me to keep track sometimes. he has so many friends.
speaker1: so knives, how did you meet scott?

speaker1: well, i was on the bus with my mom- knives freezes, staring at the stage. 
speaker2: is that seriously the end of the story?
speaker1: oh my gosh, they're on!
speaker3: this next band is from toronto and...yeah. so give it up for sex...bob-omb?
speaker4: scott...you ready?
speaker4: kim...you rea-

speaker1: mr. pilgrim. it is i, matthew patel. consider our fight...begun! 
speaker2: what did i do?
speaker2: what do i do?!

speaker1: alright. alright. 
speaker2: watch out! it's that one guy!
speaker3: thank you, wallace!
speaker1: you're quite the opponent, pilgrim.
speaker3: who the are you anyway?
speaker1: my name is matthew patel and i'm ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend!
speaker3: you're what?
speaker1: ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend!

speaker1: we're fighting because of ramona? 
speaker2: didn't you get my e-mail explaining the situation?
speaker1: i skimmed it.
speaker2: you will pay for your insolence!
speaker3: what's up with his outfit?
speaker4: yeah! is he a pirate?
speaker1: are you a pirate?
speaker2: pirates are in this year!
speaker1: you really went out with this guy?
speaker5: yeah, in the seventh grade.
speaker5: it was football season and for some reason, all the little jocks wanted me. matthew was the only non-white, non-jock boy in school, probably in the entire state, so we joined forces and took 'em all out. we were one of a team. nothing could beat matthew's mystical powers. nothing but pre-teen capriciousness. we only kissed once. after a week and a half, i told him to hit the showers.

speaker1: dude, wait...mystical powers? 
speaker2: you'll pay for this, flowers!
speaker2: if you want to fight me, you're not the brightest. you won't know what's hit you in the slightest.
speaker2: me and my fireballs and my demon hipster chicks, i'm talking the talk because i know i'm slick.
speaker2: fireball girls! take this sucker down.
speaker2: let us show him what we're all about.
speaker1: that doesn't even rhyme.
speaker2: this is impossible, how can it be?!
speaker1: open your eyes. maybe you'll see.

speaker1: well, it was great meeting you. 
speaker2: gay friends?
speaker2: wallace?! not again!

speaker1: aw man. $2.40? that's not even enough for the bus home. 
speaker2: i'll lend you the 30 cents.
speaker3: yeah...so like, bob-omb wins.

speaker1: sooooooo... 
speaker1: what was all that all about?
speaker2: uh, i guess...
speaker2: if we're going to date, you may have to defeat my seven evil ex's.
speaker1: you have seven evil ex-boyfriends?

speaker1: seven ex's, yes. 
speaker2: so i have to fight-
speaker1: defeat.
speaker2: -defeat your seven evil ex's if we're going to continue to date.
speaker1: pretty much.
speaker2: so, what you're saying is...
speaker2: we are dating?
speaker1: uh, i guess.
speaker2: cool. do you want to make out?
speaker1: uh...

speaker1: someone's happy. 
speaker2: well, someone got to second base last night. and someone has a second date tonight.
speaker1: someone's lucky then.

speaker1: oh, hey, i'm inviting ramona over for dinner, so you can't be here tonight.

speaker2: if you don't do it, i'm going to tell ramona about knives. i swear to scott.
speaker1: but you...you're...
speaker3: morning.

speaker1: i didn't make up the gay rulebook. if you have a problem with it, take it up with liberace's ghost. 
speaker2: you're a monster.
speaker1: now put the bacon down and go do your dirt while i watch the lucas lee marathon on tbs superstation.
speaker2: who's lucas lee?

speaker1: he's filming a winifred hailey movie in toronto right now. 
speaker2: they make movies in toronto?

speaker1: no, it's okay. why?
speaker2: well i mean, i'm too old for you!
speaker1: no you're not! my dad is nine years older than my mom...
speaker2: and...and...are you even allowed to date outside your race or whatever?
speaker1: i don't care. i'm in...love!

speaker1: really? 
speaker2: yeah...um...it's not going to work out.
speaker1: oh...

speaker1: where's knives? not coming tonight?

speaker2: oh! check it out, i learned the bass line from final fantasy 2.
speaker1: scott, you are the salt of the earth.
speaker2: aw, thanks.
speaker1: wait. i meant scum of the earth.
speaker2: aw, thanks.
speaker3: you...you broke up with knives?

speaker1: yeah, but don't worry, maybe you'll meet my new new girlfriend soon. 
speaker2: newnew.
speaker3: okay! from here on out, no girlfriends or girlfriend talk at practice, whether they're old, new or new-new. we were lucky to survive that last round. this is sudden death now. okay?
speaker1: okay!

speaker1: that's for me. 
speaker1: hey...you're here?
speaker2: yes. like you said. is it not cool?
speaker1: you know your hair?
speaker2: i know of it.
speaker1: it's all blue.
speaker2: yeah. i just dyed it. are you going to introduce me?
speaker1: oh yeah, this is stephen stills, young neil, that's... kim.
speaker2: hey everyone.

speaker1: i change my hair every week and a half, dude. get used to it. so...uh...how do you guys all know each other? 
speaker2: high school, i guess?
speaker3: what neil said.
speaker2: i'm neil.
speaker4: believe it or not, i actually dated scott in high school.
speaker1: got any embarassing stories?
speaker4: yeah. he's an
speaker5: okay. cool. see you guys tomorrow.
speaker3: uh, what about rehearsal?
speaker5: neil knows my parts.
speaker2: i'm neil.

speaker1: are you doing okay there? 
speaker2: yeah, good. good.
speaker2: she changed her hair.

speaker1: i know, but she changed it without even making a big deal about it. she's spontaneous. impulsive. 
speaker2: i can't believe you were worried about me gaying up the place.
speaker3: how's dinner coming along?
speaker1: yeah, good. good.
speaker2: i'll leave you lovebirds to it. i'm heading up to casa loma to stalk my hetero crush.
speaker1: don't go.
speaker2: will you man the up? you could get to 2nd and a half base.
speaker1: you think so?
speaker2: well, if you strike out in the next hour, come find me at the castle.
speaker1: 'âœif i strike out'â?
speaker2: okay, 'âœwhen'â. see you in sixty.

speaker1: garlic bread is my favorite food. i could honestly eat it for every meal. or just all the time without even stopping. 
speaker2: you'd get fat.
speaker1: no. why would i get fat?
speaker2: bread makes you fat.
speaker1: bread makes you fat??

speaker1: so i wrote a song about you. 
speaker2: oh yeah?
speaker1: yeah, it goes like this: ra-mona, ra-mona, ra-ra-ra, mona, ra-mona, ra-mona, ra-ra-ra, mona, ooooh.
speaker2: i can't wait to hear it when it's finished.
speaker1: finished?

speaker1: ha. no, sorry. it's just that i got... i got a bad haircut right before me and my big ex broke up. but it's so long ago, i can barely remember it... 
speaker2: scott is acutely aware that his last salon haircut took place exactly 431 days ago, three hours before his big breakup. he blames this largely on the haircut and has been cutting his own hair ever since.
speaker3: sounds like a bad time.
speaker1: not really.
speaker2: it was.
speaker1: it was a mutual thing.
speaker2: it wasn't.
speaker1: i mean, she told me it was mutual.
speaker2: she dumped him. it was brutal.
speaker3: what was her name?
speaker1: she was nat when i knew her. but she stopped liking that name.
speaker3: your hair is cute. i like it long.
speaker1: but it'd be cuter short! wouldn't it?!
speaker3: what? why are you wearing that?

speaker1: tell me we didn't come out here just so you could cover your hair with that hat. 
speaker2: nooo. i just love me some walking.
speaker1: you seem a little...heightened.
speaker2: yeah. i don't know. i just, when i'm with you i feel like i'm on drugs. not that i do drugs, unless you do, in which case i do drugs all the time, every drug, but...you make me feel...i don't know. things seem a little brighter around you or something.
speaker1: what is this place?
speaker2: a totally awesome castle. they're shooting this movie up here.
speaker1: who's in it?
speaker2: winifred hailey and some actor guy.
speaker1: oh, who?
speaker2: i forget. let's find out.

speaker1: did you find the guy you're stalking? 
speaker2: i think i'm about to right now.
speaker3: mr. lee is travelling!
speaker1: mr. lee?
speaker2: lucas lee.
speaker1: ooh.
speaker4: ooh?
speaker2: i want to have his adopted babies.
speaker1: oh, man. we gotta go.
speaker4: what? why?

speaker2: slut.
speaker1: wallace. i am not a slut.

speaker1: i can think of no higher accolade. 
speaker2: action.
speaker3: oh...my...god...
speaker2: hey. the only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass.
speaker3: ...you dated a famous guy?!
speaker4: in 9th grade. we had drama. actually, it might have been math. i just remember there being lots of drama.

speaker1: he just followed me around. he was a little snot nosed brat. 
speaker2: he had snot? in his nose? but he's famous!

speaker1: it's not a big deal. i only dated him for a week and a half- 
speaker2: i'm talking to you scott pilgrim!
speaker3: he's famous and he talked to me!

speaker1: the only thing keeping me and her apart is the two minutes it's gonna take to kick your ass!

speaker1: sup. how's life? he seems nice.
speaker3: scott. evil ex. fight.

speaker1: some competish you are.
speaker2: hey... hey... hey! i'm not done-
speaker1: looks like you're seeing double.
speaker1: he's good, right? sometimes i let him do wide shots if i feel like getting blazed back in my winnie.
speaker1: i'm nothing without my stunt team.
speaker3: ask them how it feels to always get his sloppy seconds!
speaker2: how does it feel to-
speaker1: i'm gonna get coffee. you homies want anything?
speaker2: mr. lee?

speaker1: you're needed back on set. 
speaker2: prepare... prepare to feel the wrath of the league of evil exes!

speaker2: yeah, bro. let's get a beer.
speaker1: you are a pretty good actor.
speaker2: i'm going for the oscar this year.
speaker1: but are you a pretty good skater?

speaker1: i'm more than pretty good, ese. i have my own skate company. 
speaker2: so you can sell them, but can you do a thingy on that rail?
speaker1: it's called a grind, bro.
speaker2: so can you do a grind thingy now?
speaker1: are you serious? there's like 200 steps and the rails are garbage.
speaker2: hey, if it's too hardcore...
speaker1: you really think you can goad me into doing a trick like that?
speaker2: there's girls watching.
speaker1: somebody get me my board.
speaker3: hi. big fan.
speaker1: why wouldn't you be?
speaker2: wow.

speaker1: wow, he totally bailed. 
speaker2: yes!

speaker1: uh...that's a wrap everybody. 
speaker2: where's ramona? is she still here?
speaker3: no, she totally bailed.
speaker2: what's the deal? seriously.

speaker1: hey. it's me, scott again. call me back. scott pilgrim. 
speaker1: what's the deal? seriously.
speaker2: yeah, you said that last night.
speaker1: you know what really though?
speaker2: what?

speaker2: come on guy, you can't say you didn't see this coming. it was right under your nose.
speaker2: what did you think these were?
speaker1: kisses? seven little kisses?
speaker2: seven deadly x's.

speaker1: why does everything have to be so complicated? 
speaker2: if you want something bad, you have to fight for it. step up your game.
speaker1: lesbian?
speaker2: the other l-word.
speaker1: lesbians?
speaker2: okay, it's 'âœlove'â. i wasn't trying to trick you or anything. look, if she's really the girl of your dreams, then you have to let her know. you have to overcome any and all obstacles that lie in your path. you have the spirit of a warrior, scott. you can do it! be with her! it's your destiny!
speaker2: plus, i need you to move out.
speaker1: what? why? are you moving in with other scott or jimmy or someone?
speaker2: or someone. either way, i'm kind of banking on her calling you back so i won't have to evict you and feel all guilty and
speaker2: i have a feeling that's for you, guy.
speaker3: hey scott.

speaker1: ...envy? 
speaker2: oh,
speaker3: it's been a long time.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker3: a year i think?
speaker1: approximately.
speaker3: how are you?
speaker1: i'm not doing so good right now.
speaker3: that's too bad. still breaking hearts?
speaker1: what? no, stop. i've been-it's been different. you have no idea.
speaker3: probably not. do you have a girlfriend? should i be jealous?
speaker1: yes, you should. i have this totally awesome girlfriend who calls me all the time. and she's america. uh. she's american.
speaker3: what's her name?
speaker1: i'm not telling you that. ramona.
speaker3: oh.
speaker1: what? do you know her?
speaker3: uh. no.

speaker1: it sounded like you did. 
speaker2: i gotta go. nice chatting with you.

speaker1: okay. everything does suck. 
speaker1: or does it?
speaker1: oh, hey knives.
speaker1: what's that? you're outside?
speaker2: is scott here?
speaker1: you know what?

speaker1: okay, enough!
speaker2: you punched me in the boob. prepare to die, obviously.
speaker1: listen, i've had it today. can we not do this right now?

speaker1: love to postpone, darlin', but i just cashed my last raincheck. 
speaker2: what's that from?
speaker1: my brain!
speaker2: well whatever this is about, can it wait till i'm in the right frame of mind?

speaker1: nuh uh. this is one nightmare you can't wake up from. 
speaker2: wait, am i asleep right now?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: so, technically this is not a nightmare.

speaker1: right. 
speaker2: so how can i not wake up? if i'm not actually asleep.
speaker1: don't question me!
speaker2: well, i'm really, really not up for this. whatever it is.
speaker1: okay little chicken, then i'll see you later. but you won't see me. because i'll be deadly serious next time.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: nevermind!
speaker2: oh man. someone help me.

speaker1: it's scott. 
speaker2: what did he do this time?
speaker1: no, it's scott. it's actually me.
speaker2: what did you do this time?
speaker1: i didn't do anything. it's everyone else that's crazy.

speaker1: look i need to talk to you, i'm having a meltdown or whatever. are you still working? 
speaker2: i'm literally about to leave.
speaker1: cool, i'm coming in.

speaker1: ah! what did you do with my sister? 
speaker2: what can i get you?
speaker1: is there anywhere you don't work?
speaker2: they're called 'jobs', something a fuckball like you wouldn't know anything about. and by the way, i can't believe you asked ramona out after i specifically told you not to do that!
speaker1: how do you do that with your mouth?
speaker2: neverfuckingmind how i do it! what do you have to say for yourself?
speaker1: uh. can i get a caramel macchiato?

speaker1: maybe it's high time you took a look in a mirror before you wreak havoc on another girl. 
speaker2: me? wreak havoc?
speaker1: speaking of which, i hear the girl that kicked your heart in the is walking the streets of toronto again.
speaker2: so i can pick up my coffee over here?
speaker3: sorry that got a little crazy last night.
speaker2: yeah. you kind of disappeared.
speaker3: yeah, i do that. listen, i know it's hard to be around me sometimes. i'll understand if you don't want to hang anymore.
speaker2: no. no, i want to hang. the whole evil ex-boyfriend thing. no biggie.
speaker3: exes.
speaker2: i mean, i know it's early days, but i don't think anything can really get in the way of how i

speaker2: the big one?
speaker2: i'm gonna...excuse me.
speaker3: your hair is getting shaggy.
speaker1: yeah?
speaker3: so. that's ramona?

speaker3: maybe you'll see him soon. we're playing lee's palace. you guys should like, so totally come.
speaker1: that's so not going to happen.
speaker3: great. you're so on the list.

speaker2: it's pronounced 'âœscott'â.

speaker1: so...that was nat? 
speaker2: no, that was envy.
speaker1: so...what did you guys talk about?
speaker2: she's totally jealous of you.
speaker1: envy's jealous? how about that?
speaker2: yeah. how. about. that.
speaker1: what happened with the two of you?
speaker2: do you mind if we don't get into that right now?
speaker2: she wanted to move to montreal because she missed her best friend.
speaker1: and two weeks later, you heard they were sleeping together i guess?
speaker2: basically.
speaker1: i dated a todd once. that didn't end well either.
speaker2: i can see how it having the past come back to haunt you.

speaker1: what do you want to think about? 
speaker2: how warm my place is right now.

speaker1: and you didn't bang her? are you gay? 
speaker2: i couldn't stop thinking about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

speaker3: all our shows are secret shows.
speaker2: we're doing it. g-man might be there! we play the next round of the battle saturday. we need to get some buzz going. we need groundswell. we need stalkers.
speaker1: what would you do? if your ex was in a band and they wanted you to open for them?
speaker4: if my ex was in the band?
speaker1: yeah.
speaker4: it might be a little awkward. but maybe it's the grown up thing to do.
speaker1: yeah, we're all adults right?

speaker1: he only likes her cause she's old! she's probably like 25! she's just some fat-ass white girl, you know? 
speaker2: i think you mentioned she was fa-

speaker1: she's got a head start! i didn't even know there was good music until like two months ago! okay, this really burns. 
speaker2: we should rinse-
speaker1: i mean, he knew i was cool but he thought i was too young, so he tried to find someone cool but old.
speaker2: she's cool? i thought she was fat-
speaker1: well she thinks she's cool. this is all her fault.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: it must be her fault. obviously it's just a twist of fate or whatever, isn't it? star crossed lovers! born too late!
speaker1: oh god...i look so...so good.

speaker2: she doesn't need ulterior motives, stephen. she's got a write-up in spin!
speaker4: you're my role model envy.
speaker3: just saying, cute couple. i like your outfit ramona. affordable?
speaker2: i was going to say, envy. did you get those jeans in new york, they're-

speaker2: ramona lived in new york.
speaker3: i was just there. we played the chaos theatre for gideon. you know him, right?

speaker1: knives!? 
speaker2: that's right. i'm not afraid to hit a girl. i'm a rock star.
speaker3: you punched the highlights out of her hair!
speaker3: he punched the highlights. out. of.
speaker4: you're incorrigible.
speaker2: i don't know the meaning of the word.
speaker5: so, are you guys doing anything fun while you're in town?
speaker2: fun? in toronto?
speaker1: that is it, you cocky cock! you'll pay

speaker1: kk...my neck...yy...your hair... 
speaker2: didn't you know? todd's vegan.
speaker3: it's not a big deal.

speaker1: no kidding...anyone can be...vegan. 
speaker2: ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.
speaker1: ovo what?
speaker2: i partake not in the meat nor breastmilk or ovum of any creature that has a face.
speaker3: short answer: being vegan just makes you better than most people.
speaker2: bingo.
speaker4: hey man, question. i always wondered, how does not eating dairy products give you psychic powers?
speaker2: you know how you only use ten percent of your brain? well, it's because the other 90% is filled up with curds and whey.
speaker5: did you learn that at vegan academy?
speaker2: go ahead and get snippy baby, if you knew the science, maybe i'd listen to a word you're saying.
speaker1: if i peed my pants, would you pretend i just got wet from the rain?

speaker1: oh. how about you give me the cliff notes on how and why you ended up dating this a-hole? 
speaker2: is that really important right now?
speaker1: if there's a key element in his backstory that can help me out in a critical moment of not dying? yes.
speaker2: i was only dating lucas until the minute todd walked by. i guess that's not very nice, but i used to be kind of...like that.
speaker2: we hated everyone. we wrecked stuff. nobody cared.
speaker2: he punched a hole in the moon for me. it was pretty crazy.
speaker2: a week and a half later, he told me his dad was sending him to the vegan academy, so i dumped him. does that help you at all?
speaker1: have you dumped everyone you've ever been with? you've never been the dumpee?
speaker2: look, i've dabbled with being a it's part of the reason i moved here. i was really hoping to put it all behind me.

speaker1: we have unfinished business, i and he! 
speaker2: he and me.
speaker1: don't you talk to me about grammar!
speaker2: i...dislike you. capiche?
speaker1: tell it to the cleaning lady on monday.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: because you'll be dust by monday.
speaker2: um...
speaker1: because i'll be pulverizing you in two seconds. and the cleaning lady...cleans up...dust. she dusts.
speaker2: sorry, so what's on monday?
speaker1: cos it's friday now and she has weekends off, so...monday. right?
speaker3: basically, you can't win this fight and you'll have to give up on this girl, 'â˜cos todd is going to kill you.
speaker2: you used to be so...nice!
speaker4: uh, we're going to pizza pizza for a slice, call us when you're done.

speaker1: sorry, baby. crummy way to end things, i know. 
speaker2: get me my bass. the good one.

speaker1: you're going down. vegan style! 
speaker2: the reverb is hurting my soul!!!
speaker1: that's right, pilgrim. i actually know how to play bass.

speaker1: i can read your thoughts. your bass hand is badly injured. you're through. 
speaker2: what say we drink to my memory?

speaker1: dude. i can see in your mind's eye that you poured half and half into one of these coffees in an attempt to make me break vegan edge. i'll take the one with soy. thanks, tool. 
speaker2: actually, i poured soy in this cup, but thought real hard about pouring it in that one. you know, in my mind's eye or whatever.
speaker1: what are you talking about?
speaker2: you just drank half and half.
speaker3: freeze! vegan police!
speaker4: todd ingram, you're under arrest for veganity violation code number 827, imbibement of half and half!
speaker1: that's bullroar!
speaker4: no vegan diet, no vegan powers.
speaker1: but this is a first offense! don't i get three strikes?
speaker5: at 12:27 a.m. on february 1st, you knowingly ingested gelato.
speaker1: gelato isn't vegan?
speaker4: milk and eggs,
speaker5: on april 4th, 7:30 p.m., you partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

speaker1: envy gasps, disgusted. 
speaker2: chicken isn't vegan?
speaker3: the deveganizing ray! hit him.

speaker1: you once were a vegone, but now you will be gone! 
speaker2: vegone?
speaker1: uh, sorry i guess.
speaker3: sorry? you just headbutted my boyfriend so hard he burst.
speaker1: you kicked my heart in the ass. so i guess we're even. natalie.
speaker3: no one calls me that anymore.
speaker1: maybe they should. now let's get out of here.
speaker4: crummy way to end things, i know. envy blinks, in shock. julie pops into shot.

speaker1: for the record, i am so off for you right now. 
speaker2: shut the up, julie.

speaker1: envy adams. i hate that so much i kind of love her. 
speaker2: yeah. that todd guy was cool too. and hot. i liked him.
speaker3: are you okay?
speaker4: uh huh.
speaker3: you sure about that?
speaker4: do i look like i'm not okay?
speaker5: we're still going to the after show right?
speaker6: i'm not sure it's gonna be much of a party, i think a third of the band just went 'âœpoom'â.
speaker5: cool bands never go to their own after parties. it's just the desperate people trying to rub elbows with label guys.
speaker6: then why would we...oh.
speaker5: neil, you down?

speaker1: scott? you're in right? 
speaker2: do you want to go?
speaker3: i kind of almost died back there, so...
speaker2: i'm not saying i want to go.
speaker3: hey, we can totally go.
speaker2: i'll do whatever you want to do.
speaker3: so let's go.
speaker4: are scott and ramona fighting?
speaker5: not to my knowledge.
speaker4: oh.
speaker5: i mean, not with fists.
speaker4: oh.
speaker5: yet.
speaker4: ooh.

speaker1: no, i'm fine, i'm fine. it's just- 
speaker2: it's just...?

speaker1: well, not that fighting harder and harder battles for your love is getting old or anything...but have you ever dated someone who wasn't a total ass? 
speaker2: so far you're not a total ass.
speaker1: but i'm part ass?
speaker2: if it makes you feel better, you're the nicest guy i've dated.
speaker1: wait...is that good?
speaker2: it's what i need right now.
speaker1: but not...later?
speaker2: scott, i don't have all the answers. i'd just like to live in the moment if i can.
speaker1: yeah, i'd just like to live.

speaker1: okay, i know todd was bad news. but are you saying envy wasn't? we all have baggage. 
speaker2: my baggage doesn't try and kill me every five minutes. what did you do to your ex-boyfriends to make them so insane?
speaker1: exes.

speaker1: no break up is painless. someone always gets hurt. what about you and that girl knives? 
speaker2: knives?
speaker1: who broke up with who?
speaker2: i believe...i broke up with her.
speaker1: and was she cool with that?
speaker2: knives is with young neil now, she's totally cool with it.
speaker1: you sure about that?
speaker2: yeah. she's very mature for her age. it was a very healthy break up. we're all peaches and gravy.
speaker1: and what about you and kim?
speaker2: me and kim? i can barely remember.
speaker1: hey, you want to know everything about my past, dude.
speaker2: it was just...yeah. i don't know. it was high school. she had freckles. it was cool, i guess.
speaker1: that's it?
speaker2: yeah, it kind of ended. we changed.

speaker1: that's really the whole story? 
speaker2: okay! i had to fight a dude to get with her! i fought a crazy eighty foot tall purple suited dude! and i had to fight 96 guys to get to him, too! he was flying and shooting lightning bolts from his eyes! he was totally awesome and i kicked him so far he saw the curvature of the earth! does that make you feel any better?
speaker1: well now you are being a total ass. welcome to the club.
speaker2: sorry. i'm not usually like this.
speaker1: hey, don't worry. i don't know what i'm like anymore.
speaker2: i guess this whole ex-boyfriends thing is really messing with my head.
speaker1: exes.
speaker2: why do you keep saying-
speaker2: girl from earlier?
speaker1: roxy?
speaker2: you know this girl?

speaker1: oh boy, does she know me. 
speaker2: what...is...she...talking about?
speaker1: he really doesn't know?
speaker2: you and her?!

speaker1: it was just a phase. 
speaker2: just a phase?
speaker3: you had a phase?
speaker1: i didn't think it would count! it meant nothing.
speaker2: it meant nothing???
speaker1: i was just a little bi-curious.
speaker2: well honey, i'm a little bi-furious!
speaker1: do that again and i will end you.
speaker2: back off hasbian. if gideon can't have you, no one can. the league hath spoken.
speaker1: then gideon best get his pretentious up here, 'â˜cos i'm about to kick yours out of the great white north.

speaker1: you unbelievable 
speaker2: believe it.
speaker3: wallace?
speaker4: uh huh?
speaker3: this is happening right?
speaker4: uh huh.
speaker3: i mean, this is live?
speaker4: oh yeah. kick her in the balls,

speaker1: i'm sending you back to gideon in a thousand pieces, you slag. 
speaker2: i'd rather be dead than go back. he's a creep, you're a and you all deserve each other.
speaker1: give it a rest, ramona. this is a league game.

speaker1: meaning? 
speaker2: meaning your precious scott must defeat me with his own fists. or possibly feet.

speaker1: i'm not sure i can hit a girl. 
speaker2: you don't have a choice.
speaker3: fight your own battles, lazy ass!
speaker3: every pilgrim reaches the end of his journey. some sooner than others.
speaker3: your b.f's about to get f'd in the b!
speaker2: her weak point's the back of her knees!
speaker1: what? how does that work?
speaker2: whenever we were making out, i-
speaker1: okay.

speaker1: oh... 
speaker1: you'll...never...be able to do this to herrrrrrrrrrr!

speaker1: sooooo... 
speaker2: two gin and tonics please.
speaker1: i thought you didn't drink.
speaker2: only on special occasions. why? did you want one?
speaker1: i guess we really don't know that much about each other do we?
speaker2: maybe you could just give me a list of all your exes so at least i know who's going to beat my into the ground next.
speaker1: oh, like a handy little laminate or something? let me see if i can find one. maybe we could exchange our information.
speaker2: just out of sheer curiosity and concern for my mortal well-being, is there anyone at this party you haven't slept with?

speaker1: i really think we should split. 
speaker2: as in 'â˜get out of here'? or as in 'â˜split split'?

speaker1: how could i not? i feel like we just washed our laundry in public. 
speaker2: dirty laundry. you're drunk.
speaker1: i've had like one drink.
speaker2: well i'm sorry i cared. i don't enjoy all this scott. in fact i'm sick of it. i thought you might be more understanding.

speaker1: you're just another evil ex- boyfriend waiting to happen. 
speaker1: and yes, there is someone at this party i haven't slept with. you.
speaker1: p.s. here's your stupid list.

speaker1: who the are the katayanagi twins? 
speaker2: you don't know?

speaker1: ramona dated twins? 
speaker2: apparently.
speaker3: at the same time?
speaker2: you know what? i don't know and i don't want to know.
speaker4: good. you know how i feel about girls the rock.
speaker2: good. i play better in a bad mood.
speaker4: if it's gonna be an issue though, young neil can fill in for you.
speaker2: it's not an issue. you know bands, i know battles. we got it covered.
speaker4: well, we'd understand if you didn't want to take part.
speaker2: not only do i want to take part. i want to take them apart.
speaker4: okay. i'm getting tingles.
speaker3: whoa...

speaker1: okay. we're doomed. 
speaker2: oh...

speaker1: oh, we are going to get killed. 
speaker2: come on. you're onstage in five.
speaker3: aren't the katamaris or whatever on first?
speaker2: i think you're both on first?
speaker1: wait...amp versus amp? we're going on stage at the same time?
speaker3: that's impossible-

speaker1: okay. my bad. 
speaker2: your bad is saying my bad.
speaker3: we shouldn't even be here. we shouldn't even be here.
speaker1: come on man! i put aside my problems for the music. if i can do that, we can do anything.
speaker2: did you speak to ramona then?
speaker1: what? no. i haven't seen her since the other night.

speaker1: and i really don't care. 
speaker2: okay gang. can we do this? i mean, we can do this. right?
speaker1: right.
speaker2: scott?
speaker1: scott!
speaker3: they brought the house down.

speaker1: let's break up now and get it over with. we screwed the pooch in front of gideon graves. we're done. 
speaker2: gideon...is here? where?
speaker2: that's gideon?
speaker2: alright. let's do this!

speaker1: that...was epic. 
speaker2: scott. what are you doing?
speaker3: getting a life.
speaker4: i just came to see the show. i'm not even stalking you.
speaker3: you seem... different.
speaker4: i feel like i know stuff now.
speaker3: ramona...

speaker1: ramona. i have something i need to tell you. 
speaker2: yeah, i have something to-

speaker1: great. listen, i know you just play mysterious and aloof to avoid getting hurt. i know you have reasons for not wanting to talk about your past. and i want you to know, i don't care about any of that stuff. why? because i'm in lesbians with you. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: i really, really mean it.

speaker1: oh. okay. 
speaker2: what did you want to tell me?
speaker1: that we have to break up.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: yeah...it's not going to work out.
speaker2: oh okay...
speaker1: it's gideon. i just...i can't help myself around him.
speaker3: that's the bad news.
speaker4: the good news, scottie, is i'm officially loving the bombs.
speaker2: bob-omb.
speaker4: three piece rock outfit with a semi- attractive female drummer? music to my earholes.
speaker4: you know, i'm not even going to wait to see how you guys do in the final. i'm signing you right now for a three album deal. gideon produces a contract and clicks a pen.
speaker4: see? i'm not such a bad guy after all.

speaker1: you think we're gonna sell our souls to you? well then guess- 
speaker1: nuh-uh. i can't be part of the band with this douche-in-charge.
speaker2: scottie, buddy, can i just say, keep your emotions in check. don't let what's past screw up your future.
speaker3: the people need to hear us, scott.
speaker1: then you're going to need to find someone else to play bass.
speaker4: looks like we're all set.
speaker4: oh and scott, we should really be thanking each other. i mean, if it wasn't for me, you would have never been with ramona, but if it wasn't for you, she wouldn't be back with me. so i guess it all shakes out.
speaker4: and hey, the whole league of evil exes thing? i was in a dark place when i put that together. forgiven?
speaker1: i said 'â˜lesbians'!

speaker1: was she really the one? 
speaker2: the wha?
speaker1: i mean, did you really see a future with this girl?
speaker2: like...with jetpacks?
speaker1: time heals all wounds, little brother. maybe next time let's not date the girl with eleven evil ex- boyfriends.
speaker2: seven.
speaker1: oh. well that's not so bad. stacey heads off. scott looks at the camera.
speaker2: aaah!

speaker1: presumably you just saw someone's junk, and i apologize for that. 
speaker2: sorry.
speaker3: was that other scott or jimmy or someone?
speaker1: or someone.
speaker2: it's chris.
speaker1: it's chris.

speaker1: scott, you know i love you. but i need my own bed tonight. for sex. 
speaker2: right.
speaker1: i may need it the rest of the week too.
speaker2: right.
speaker2: i get it.
speaker1: maybe you can move in with ramona.
speaker2: she's with gideon.
speaker1: ah. that but you know, it's probably just because he's better than you.

speaker1: scott nods. 
speaker2: he'll certainly have better hair.

speaker1: either way, i think this fight is over. 
speaker1: you can sleep on the floor until you get somewhere else to stay. i got you muffs and blinkers in case this might happen.
speaker2: thanks.
speaker3: it's for scott.
speaker2: hello?
speaker4: hey, pal. just wanted to say i feel terrible about earlier. i don't want any hard feelings, so i figured why not be the bigger man and give you a call.
speaker2: is ramona with you?

speaker1: i don't know. are you with me? 
speaker2: yeah.

speaker1: sure you did. well as you know, i'm opening a new chaos theatre in toronto and the bobs are playing our grand opening tonight, and it would feel really weird for all of us if you weren't there. they just did a sound check and the acoustics in here are amazing. 
speaker2: yeah. maybe i'll see you there.
speaker1: i hope so, amigo. i don't want anymore bad blood between ex's.
speaker2: mm.
speaker1: okay laters.
speaker3: what a perfect
speaker3: forget what i said earlier. finish him.

speaker1: password? 
speaker2: whatever.
speaker1: cool.

speaker1: second password? 
speaker1: cool.

speaker1: yeah, their first album is so much better than their first album. 
speaker2: scott!
speaker2: let it go. don't give him the satisfaction.
speaker3: what if i want the satisfaction?
speaker2: well, then you're doomed.
speaker4: scott pilgrim!
speaker4: hey buddy, welcome to the chaos theatre. somebody get this man a drink! coke zero right?
speaker3: i'm not here to drink.
speaker4: i got no beef with you.
speaker3: what if i have a beef...with you?

speaker1: are you still mad about that whole thing with the guild? 
speaker2: you mean 'âœthe league'â?
speaker3: guild, league, whatever. it's ancient history.
speaker2: i'll show you how ancient of history it is.
speaker1: no use crying over spilt coke, buddy. the lady made her choice and we're all gonna have to move on.
speaker2: well i ain't moving...buddy.
speaker1: you want to fight me for her?
speaker2: was that not clear? was that not clear?
speaker1: now why on earth do you want to do that?
speaker2: because, i'm in love with her.
speaker4: scott earned the power of love... ramona looks away from scott. gideon smiles.
speaker1: i think this deserves a song.

speaker1: ramona. my cane. 
speaker2: your club by the way.
speaker3: if my cathedral of cutting edge taste holds no interest for your tragically canadian sensibilities, then i shall grant you a swift exit from the premises. and fast entrance into helllllll.

speaker1: you'll pay for what you did to him! 
speaker2: listen, kung pao chicken, your old old boyfriend brought this all on himself. he was warned plenty of times. but did he listen? did he f-
speaker1: i'm not talking to you. i'm talking to her!
speaker3: what?

speaker1: you're kidding right? 
speaker2: you can't say i don't know how to put on a show.
speaker1: what the is your deal?
speaker3: you stole him with your advanced american technology.
speaker1: i don't know what you're talking about, i didn't steal anyone.

speaker1: can we please stop all this fighting! nobody stole anybody. knives, i dated you and then i dated ramona. okay? 
speaker1: i mean...maybe i kind of forgot to tell knives right away, but...
speaker2: then you cheated on me, scott!
speaker2: you cheated on both of us.
speaker3: you cheated on me with knives?
speaker1: no! i cheated on knives. with you.
speaker3: is there a difference?
speaker1: you weren't wronged?
speaker1: right?
speaker4: game over!
speaker5: scottie. you can cheat on these ladies all you want, but you can't...cheat...death.

speaker1: i'm sorry. dying probably 
speaker2: you know what sucks? getting killed by that guy. why him?
speaker1: it's complicated.
speaker2: well, maybe now would be the time to get into it. seeing as i'm about to die.
speaker1: alright... the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. i was crazy about him. but he ignored me. i was more alone when we were together than i ever was on my own. that's why i had to leave... and that's when he started paying attention.
speaker2: so why go back?
speaker1: i can't help myself around him, scott. he just... has a way of getting into my head.
speaker2: well, that's legitimately disappointing. i really will leave you alone forever now...
speaker1: no. i mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head.
speaker2: that is evil.
speaker1: he's like that.
speaker2: so this kinda for everybody, eh?

speaker1: i'm sorry it had to end this way. 
speaker2: you can't say i didn't try. i really fought for you back there.
speaker1: uh-huh.
speaker1: but someone was fighting pretty hard for you back there.
speaker2: knives?
speaker1: i wish i was ever as fanatically devoted to anything as that girl is to you.
speaker2: i feel like i learned something. which would be great if i wasn't dead.
speaker2: so...so alone.
speaker2: ahhhhhh...

speaker1: again? 
speaker2: turn off the light!
speaker3: wallace, when my journey began, i was living in an ordinary world. ramona skated through my dreams and it was like a call to adventure, a call i considered refusing. but my mentor, that's you, told me if i want something bad enough i have to fight for it. so i did. there were tests, allies, enemies. i approached a deep cave and went through a crazy ordeal, during which i totally seized the sword. sadly, i died. then i resurrected! now i realize what i should have been fighting for all along. but before i do that, i need to ask one final favor of you.
speaker2: sure thing, guy.
speaker3: could you put a robe on and hand me the phone?
speaker3: toronto. chaos theatre. gideon graves.
speaker3: tell him scott pilgrim is calling.
speaker4: scott. i was just about to-
speaker3: hey, pal. i feel terrible about everything. i don't want any hard feelings, so i figure why not be the bigger man and give you a call.
speaker4: um...

speaker1: 'â˜sup? 
speaker2: whatever.

speaker1: yeah, their first album is so- 
speaker2: scott! let it go.
speaker3: don't worry. i know what i'm doing. stephen, the new line-up rocks. you guys sound better without me. young neil? you have learned well. from this point forward, you shall be known as 'âœneil'â. and kim?
speaker3: sorry about...everything.
speaker3: sorry about me.

speaker1: scott pilgrim! 
speaker1: hey buddy, welcome to the chaos-
speaker2: save it. you're pretentious, the club i have beef, let's do it.
speaker1: you want to fight me for her?
speaker2: no...i want to fight you for me.
speaker3: scott earned the power of self-respect.
speaker2: kim?

speaker1: ramona. my cane. 
speaker2: how's it going back there?
speaker1: you

speaker1: knives! i know you're in here! don't attack ra- 
speaker2: steal my boyfriend, taste my steel.

speaker1: no, scott! this fat hurt me and i will have my revenge! 
speaker2: no, knives. i hurt you. i cheated on you.
speaker1: you cheated on me scott?
speaker2: i cheated on both of you. and i'm sorry. i was a different guy back then.
speaker2: and...you're not a fat ass. she didn't mean that. so, are we all good?
speaker3: never felt better.
speaker4: are we all done with the hugging and learning? i thought we had a fight going here.

speaker1: oh, you got a fight alright. 
speaker2: ramona. are you with me?

speaker1: wrong move, baby. 
speaker1: yeah. you're still my girl.
speaker2: let's both be girls.

speaker1: who do you think you are pilgrim? you think you're better than me? i'll tell you what you are. a pain in my ass. you know how long it took to get all the evil exes' contact information so i could form this stupid league? like two hours! 
speaker1: you're not cool enough for ramona. you're zero. you're nothing. me? i'm what's hip. i'm what's happening. i'm blowing up right now.

speaker1: whoa... 
speaker2: there goes our deal.
speaker3: we're still getting paid, right?
speaker2: there goes our deal.
speaker1: oh...
speaker4: you two make a good combo.
speaker5: yeah?
speaker4: yeah.

speaker1: you can defeat me...but can you defeat...yourself? 
speaker2: negascott!
speaker3: no. this is something i have to face on my own.

speaker1: what happened? 
speaker2: aw, nothing. we just shot the he's a super-nice guy. we actually have a lot in common.
speaker1: your hair.

speaker1: it's getting really shaggy. 
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: i like it.
speaker2: you do?
speaker2: hey... where are you going?
speaker3: i dunno. i should probably disappear.
speaker2: after all that?
speaker3: it's hard, you know? i came here to get away, but the past keeps catching up. i'm tired of people getting hurt because of me.
speaker2: i think i understand.
speaker3: i should tahnk you, though.
speaker2: for what?
speaker3: for being the nicest guy i ever dated.

speaker1: that's kind of sad. 
speaker2: it is kind of sad.
speaker2: well... bye and stuff.
speaker1: yeah. and stuff.
speaker3: go get her.
speaker1: wha?
speaker3: you earned it. you've been fighting for her all along.
speaker1: but what about you?
speaker3: i'll be fine. i'm too cool for you anyway.
speaker3: there's someone out there for me.
speaker3: go talk to her. before she's gone.
speaker1: hey... mind if i tag along?

speaker1: you want to come with me? 
speaker2: i thought maybe we could... try again?
speaker3: oh my can i blow your mind? scott pilgrim totally threw down with gideon graves at the grand opening of chaos theater. yeah, it was apparently awesome.
speaker4: oh my it was a huge fight. i mean bananas. my little brother kicked a guy's head off. literally. it was unbelievable. someone seriously should have been filming it.
