speaker1: wake me up when you get home.

speaker1: what's that? 
speaker2: a videotape.
speaker1: who's it from?
speaker2: i don't know... there's no return address on the envelope... in fact, there's no address on it.
speaker1: does it say anything on the tape?
speaker2: no, nothing.
speaker1: well, let's see what's on it.
speaker1: come on.
speaker2: it must be from a real estate agent.
speaker1: maybe.

speaker1: good book, huh? 
speaker2: huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
speaker1: same one you were reading the other night?
speaker2: what night?
speaker1: when you didn't come to the club.
speaker2: oh. oh, yeah. no. this is a different one.
speaker1: i called, you know.
speaker2: called? when?
speaker1: from the club. you didn't answer.
speaker2: i must have fallen asleep. i was asleep when you got home, wasn't i?
speaker1: you were asleep when i got home, yes.

speaker1: i had a dream about you last night... 
speaker2: yeah?
speaker1: you were in the house... calling my name... but i couldn't find you.

speaker1: fred? fred, where are you? 
speaker2: then there you were... lying in bed... but it wasn't you... it looked like you... but it wasn't.

speaker1: you're up early. 
speaker2: that dog woke me. i lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
speaker1: who the owns that dog?
speaker1: what's that? another tape?
speaker2: yes, i just found it on the step.

speaker1: don't you want to watch it? 
speaker2: i guess so.
speaker1: well, do you wanna watch it?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker2: we've got to call the police.
speaker1: all right.

speaker1: ...yes, i've been on hold for ten minutes... i can't... all right, thanks. 
speaker1: hello, yes... good... my name is renee madison... my husband is fred madison, the jazz musician... we live at 442 hollis street... right... 442 hollis... near the observatory... someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... i know because they sent, dropped off a videotape... two videotapes... to show us... that's right... yes... it... the second one... shows us asleep... someone broke in and taped us while we slept!... isn't that enough?... okay, sure... we will... 442 hollis... yes, we'll be here.
speaker2: so?
speaker1: two detectives are coming out.

speaker1: that's it. 
speaker2: let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.

speaker1: very strange. 
speaker2: what is?
speaker1: the angle. the high angle shot on the tape.
speaker3: how'd the camera get so high like that?
speaker1: and smooth... almost no movement - back and forth, i mean.
speaker3: like you'd get if it was hand held.
speaker1: right ... this just glided along.

speaker1: this is the bedroom. 
speaker2: do you always sleep here?... in this room?... both of you?
speaker3: this is our bedroom.
speaker1: there's no other bedroom?
speaker3: no... there is, i mean, i use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
speaker2: you're a musician?
speaker3: yes, i thought my wife ...
speaker1: what's your axe?
speaker3: tenor... tenor saxophone. do you...
speaker1: tone deaf.
speaker2: do you own a video camera?
speaker4: no. fred hates them.
speaker3: i like to remember things my own way.
speaker2: what do you mean by that?
speaker3: how i remember them. not necessarily the way they happened.
speaker1: do you have an alarm system?
speaker4: yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it.
speaker2: why not?
speaker3: it kept going off for some reason. false alarms.
speaker1: might be a good time to try using it again.
speaker2: anybody else have a key to the house.
speaker4: no.
speaker2: maid? relative?
speaker4: no, one of us is always here to let the maid in. nobody else has a key.
speaker1: let's check the doors and windows... see if there's been a break-in.

speaker1: we'll keep a watch on the house. 
speaker2: as best we can.
speaker1: if anything else happens, you'll call us. al hands fred a card. ed hands renee a card.
speaker3: we will.
speaker4: thanks, guys.
speaker2: it's what we do.

speaker1: what the is going on?! 
speaker2: i wish i knew.
speaker1: what was that?!!!
speaker2: what?
speaker1: on the tape! there was something else on the tape.
speaker1: there! play it!

speaker1: you don't remember being awakened? it looks like you were aware of someone. 
speaker2: or something.
speaker3: no, i don't remember anything. it looks like i... but... i don't remember.
speaker4: why would anyone do something like this?
speaker1: has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
speaker2: or not so recently?
speaker3: no, not to me.
speaker4: i... no. no. no threats.
speaker2: we'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you?
speaker1: we'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
speaker4: i don't know if i want to stay here. i don't feel safe.
speaker3: where would you feel safe?
speaker4: i don't know. maybe a hotel.
speaker2: did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
speaker3: the first night ... not the last two.
speaker1: why not?
speaker3: i forgot. anyway, i hate the idea of acting paranoid.
speaker4: acting paranoid?!!! someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! i thought you set the alarm!
speaker3: i'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
speaker4: but that doesn't solve the problem. who is doing this? and why?
speaker1: we'll find out, mrs. madison.

speaker1: we've met before, haven't we? 
speaker2: i don't think so. where was it that you think we've met?
speaker1: at your house. don't you remember?
speaker2: no, no i don't. are you sure?
speaker1: of course. in fact, i'm there right now.
speaker2: what do you mean? you're where right now?
speaker1: at your house.
speaker2: that's absurd.
speaker1: call me.
speaker1: dial your number.
speaker1: go ahead.

speaker1: i told you i was here. 
speaker2: how did you do that?
speaker1: ask me.
speaker2: how did you get into my house?

speaker1: you invited me. it's not my habit to go where i'm not wanted. 
speaker2: who are you?

speaker1: give me my phone back. 
speaker1: it's been a pleasure talking to you.
speaker2: i thought you were getting me a drink?
speaker3: just a minute.

speaker1: andy, who is that guy? 
speaker2: i don't know his name. he's a friend of laurent's, i think.
speaker1: laurent?
speaker2: yes, i believe so.
speaker1: but laurent is dead, isn't he?
speaker2: he is? i didn't think you knew how do you know he's dead?
speaker1: i don't. i don't know him.
speaker2: can't be dead. who told you he was dead?
speaker3: honey, who?... who's dead?
speaker1: let's go home.
speaker3: but...
speaker1: now! we're leaving now! i didn't want to come here in the first place.

speaker1: how'd you meet that asshole, andy, anyway? 
speaker2: it was a long time ago... i met him at this place called moke's... we... became friends... he told me about a job...
speaker1: what job?
speaker2: i don't remember... anyway, andy's okay...
speaker1: he's got some up friends.

speaker1: i told you to stay in the car! 
speaker2: why? what is it? why did you make me wait out here?
speaker1: i thought there might be somebody inside.
speaker2: was there?
speaker1: no... of course not.

speaker1: stay put, killer! 
speaker2: i didn't kill her! tell me i didn't kill her!

speaker1: hi, doc. workin' late tonight, huh? 
speaker2: party at the mayor's house, george. this is his daughter, joyce.
speaker1: howdy, joyce.
speaker3: howdy, george.
speaker2: just like christmas.
speaker3: i don't know if i can watch this.
speaker2: easy, girl, easy.
speaker3: you talking to me or... her?
speaker2: a corpse can tell you plenty, joyce.

speaker1: have you reached a verdict? 
speaker2: yes, we have, your honor.
speaker1: please hand it to the bailiff.
speaker1: and what is your verdict?
speaker2: we the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.
speaker1: fred madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair.

speaker1: did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces? 
speaker2: how could i miss it? the tv won't quit with that stuff.
speaker1: they're gonna cook him.
speaker2: andy's from utah. he says there you have a choice... you can die by hanging or by firing squad.
speaker1: which would you choose?
speaker2: andy would go for this, don't you think?... firing squad, definitely.
speaker1: do they aim for the head or for the heart?
speaker2: the heart, i guess.
speaker1: i wouldn't... the brain would know what's going on. your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. savage pain, marian.
speaker2: oh, that's hot... so you'd rather be hung, huh?
speaker1: absolutely... soon as your neck snaps, you black out. it might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it.
speaker2: you might be right, raquel.
speaker3: guess who?

speaker1: don't take it personal, pal. 
speaker2: un fuerte abrazo, amigo!
speaker3: hang in there, honey.
speaker4: keep an eye out for me, sammy g.

speaker1: line check. okay. 
speaker1: any final words, sam?

speaker1: something wrong? 
speaker2: my... my head.
speaker1: headache, huh? too much sun, i guess. you want to come in? still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
speaker2: no, no. i want to go in.

speaker1: what's botbering you, madison? 
speaker2: the pain is getting worse. i need more aspirin.
speaker1: i can't give you anymore. i'll talk to the doctor.

speaker2: i don't know. the guards say they've never seen him before.
speaker1: where is he now?
speaker2: he's in the infirmary, being examined.
speaker1: did you ask him who he is?
speaker2: he... he can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
speaker1: if he's not madison, then where's madison?
speaker2: i've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
speaker1: i want to take a look at this man myself.

speaker1: what is this, rogoff? 
speaker2: i don't know yet.
speaker1: who is this man?
speaker2: he's just been fingerprinted, and i'll run these blood tests right away. we'll find out soon enough.
speaker1: he's not madison?

speaker1: a headache? 
speaker2: i did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. i've never seen this man before. neither have the guards. i don't think he's in the system.

speaker1: well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. his name is peter raymond dayton. he's twenty-four years old. his birthday is april 21st. he was born and raised right here. he lives with his parents, william and claire dayton at 814 garland avenue. pete dayton was arrested five 
speaker1: warden
speaker1: how about madison? have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
speaker2: nothing, marsh. vanished. there's an apb out on him. his photo's been faxed nationwide.
speaker3: i had a call from the governor's office about this.
speaker1: how the does she know?
speaker3: there's press outside right now.
speaker1: how the hell... 7
speaker2: one of the guards must have leaked it.
speaker1: what's the word on the street?

speaker2: warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before. how did he get out?

speaker1: i'm warden clements. this is captain henderson and dr. rogoff. please, sit down. 
speaker1: mr. and mrs. dayton, as you were told over the phone, your son, peter, is here.
speaker1: he... he was discovered this morning... in a cell on death row.
speaker1: a cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named fred madison.
speaker2: the wife killer?
speaker1: yes.
speaker3: how is this possible, warden?
speaker1: ...tell me, what was peter's condition the last time you saw him?
speaker2: his condition? what do you mean?
speaker1: his physical condition.
speaker2: same as always. pete takes care of himself.
speaker3: i saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday. he's a mechanic. look, is he okay? can we see him?
speaker4: he has a hematoma on his forehead and a condition called blepharitis... that's redness and swelling around the eyes.
speaker2: was he in a fight?
speaker4: these conditions don't indicate a fight.
speaker3: but what is the cause then? ... and how did he get in that cell?
speaker4: he can't talk. or won't.
speaker2: that doesn't sound like pete.
speaker4: your son has experienced some sort of trauma, i'm afraid. we were hoping that the two of you could help explain the cause of the trauma and how he came to be here.
speaker5: you don't know fred madison?
speaker2: no... only what was in the news.
speaker5: do you think pete knows him?
speaker3: i wouldn't know how.
speaker1: you say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
speaker3: when he went to work, right.
speaker1: what about yesterday?
speaker3: he didn't come home.
speaker2: sometimes he stays at a friend's.
speaker5: any particular friends?
speaker2: a girl's, a buddy's. i don't know. he's his own man; he comes and goes as he pleases.
speaker3: i want to see him.

speaker6: i... i don't know.
speaker5: do you know fred madison?
speaker6: no.
speaker3: warden, can we take him home?
speaker4: from a medical standpoint, i don't see why not.
speaker5: we need to find out what happened here.
speaker2: have you made any charges against him?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: then he's coming home with his mother and me.
speaker1: all right... but you see our predicament... legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later. for now, he's free to leave.
speaker5: you just gonna let him go?
speaker1: we'll get a tail put on him.

speaker1: just rest easy, pete. you're gonna be okay.

speaker4: what's goin' on?
speaker6: great question!! in the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? it's been a pleasure talking to you. pete can hear the phone being passed again.
speaker5: pete... i just wanted to jump on and tell you i'm really glad you're doin' okay.

speaker1: you got him.
