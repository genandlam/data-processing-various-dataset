speaker3: it's taking shape.

speaker1: what the can it be? 
speaker2: hook-up with the president in one minute, general.
speaker3: ...send out a probe.

speaker3: i can hear you, mr. president, but i can't see you .
speaker2: is that better?
speaker3: perfect, mr. president.
speaker2: i have to address the supreme council in 10 minutes.
speaker3: there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
speaker2: what you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
speaker3: not yet sir..the only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
speaker2: options.
speaker3: wait or act.
speaker2: recommendations.
speaker3: my philosophy mr. president is shoot first ask questions later. i don't like uninvited guests.
speaker2: gentlemen?

speaker1: the security of the federated territories is and remains number one priority. i suppose general staedert's "philosophy" is acceptable to you? all the generals nod "yes" 
speaker1: all right, then! staedert?
speaker2: mr. president?
speaker1: ...yes?
speaker2: cornelius, vito cornelius. 50th level parish. i have a different theory to offer you, mr. president.
speaker1: i'm listening.
speaker3: imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
speaker1: one more reason to shoot first eh?
speaker3: evil begets evil, mr. president.

speaker1: mr. president, we're at crisis point. 
speaker2: your theory is interesting father but i don't think we have time to go into it right now!
speaker3: time is of no importance, mr. president. only life is important.

speaker1: the most terrible intelligence imaginable, mr. president. the president hesitates. 
speaker2: ...the ship is in combat formation.
speaker3: staedert? give me a minute...
speaker4: i don't, mr. president.

speaker1: load a series of 740 missiles. maximum shield protection. 
speaker2: yes, sir.
speaker3: staedert? what's going on? did you destroy it?
speaker1: i'm about to, mr. president.

speaker1: the planet's diameter has greatly increased and it's moving toward the ship. 
speaker2: staedert? get out of there immediately! i don't want an incident, do you hear me, staedert?
speaker3: ...what do we have that's bigger than 240?
speaker4: nothing, general.
speaker2: staedert, get out of there! that's an order!
speaker3: ... good

speaker1: in your dreams! see you tonight!
speaker2: cheers!

speaker1: we have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions. 
speaker2: and then?
speaker1: and then it will be too late. the goal of evil is to wipe out life! all forms of life. for all eternity...life upsets it.
speaker2: is there anything that can stop it?
speaker1: yes..thank god..

speaker1: ..will produce what the ancients called the light of creation, the light of total goodness which is the only thing that can defeat evil. 
speaker2: but what happens if instead of this... ultimate warrior... it is evil who stands here?
speaker1: white turns to black. light to dark. life to death. for all eternity.
speaker3: sir, we have a mondoshawan spaceship at the frontier requesting permission to enter our territory.
speaker2: i guess i should make a decision..

speaker2: it's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 dna memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..this one has 200,000.
speaker1: talk english doc.
speaker2: this cell is like a huge library. it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. almost like it was...engineered.
speaker1: sounds like a freak of nature to me.
speaker2: yes... i can't wait to meet him.

speaker1: the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. 
speaker2: is there any danger? some kind of virus?
speaker1: we put it through the cellular hygiene detector. the cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
speaker2: ok, go ahead! but mr. perfect better be polite... otherwise i turn him into cat food.

speaker2: fire 1000.
speaker1: but... 500 is all they need, sir.

speaker1: so what if the federal army crushed your entire race and scattered your people to the wind... your time for revenge is at hand... voila... the zf1.
speaker1: ... breaks down into four parts, undetectable by x-rays.. it's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet interventions. a word on fire power: titanium recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300. with the replay button, another zorg innovation, it's even easier... one shot. he fires at the mannequin.
speaker1: ... and replay sends every following shot to the same location...
speaker1: ...rocket launcher. the always efficient flame thrower... my favorite. our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher, with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very practical. and for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube system!
speaker1: ...four full crates, delivered right on time! what about you, my dear aknot, did you bring me what i asked you for?
speaker1: ...magnificent.

speaker1: what do you mean empty? 
speaker2: alright..i've got an open mind here..
speaker3: dot!
speaker4: planet fhloston, in the angel constellation cornelius plops down into his armchair.
speaker1: ...we're saved!

speaker1: i'm 
speaker2: you asked for a case.
speaker1: a case with four stones in it. not one! not two or three! but four!!! four stones!!! what the am i supposed to do with an empty case?!!
speaker2: ...we are warriors, not merchants!
speaker1: but you can still count. look... my fingers.
speaker1: ...four stones, four crates... zero stones...
speaker2: we risked our lives. i believe a little compensation is in order.
speaker1: so, you are a merchant, after all. leave them one crate. for the cause!

speaker1: so you forgive me? 
speaker2: not going to open?
speaker1: i've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
speaker2: how someone strong like you scared from a message? is good news i sure!
speaker1: the last two messages i got? the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
speaker2: you right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! grandfather say: "it never rain every day." this is good news guarantee.. i bet you lunch!
speaker2: ...you're fired. oh!
speaker1: at least i won lunch.
speaker2: good philosophy..see good in bad.. i like..i prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..

speaker1: i got it! everything here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel... 
speaker2: good work, my son. now all we need is a way to get there.
speaker2: i'll get it. finish your work my son.
speaker3: father cornelius?
speaker2: my son?
speaker3: mr. zorg would like a word with you.
speaker2: mr. who?

speaker1: zorg turns to cornelius. 
speaker2: zorg. jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg...
speaker3: i remember you now..the so called art dealer.
speaker2: i'm glad you got your memory back, father... because you're going to need it... where are the stones?
speaker3: ...why on earth do the stones interest you?
speaker2: personally, they are of no interest to me,
speaker3: even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you.
speaker2: why? what's wrong with me?
speaker3: ...i'm a priest! i'm here to serve life, all you want to do is destroy it.
speaker2: ah, father... you are so wrong. let me explain...
speaker2: ...would you like a drink?
speaker3: no thank you.
speaker2: follow me.. life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. look at this empty glass. zorg pushes the glass with his finger.
speaker2: here it is... peaceful... serene... but if it is...
speaker2: destroyed...
speaker2: ...look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. notice how each one is useful. what a lovely ballet, so full of form and color. so full of..life!
speaker3: they are robots!
speaker2: yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction. i gave work to at least fifty people today. the engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. fifty people who will be able to feed their children so they can grow up big and strong. children who will have children of their own, adding to the great cycle of life! cornelius sits in silence.
speaker2: father, by creating a little destruction, i am, in fact, encouraging life! so, in reality, you and i are in the same business!
speaker3: destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
speaker2: let me reassure you father..i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years. zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
speaker3: can i give you a hand?
speaker2: you saved my life... so, i'm going to spare yours. throw him out!
speaker3: you are a monster, zorg!
speaker2: i know...
speaker2: ...torture whoever you want, the president if you have to but i want those stones. you have an hour.

speaker1: why the is it eating up all those satellites like that? 
speaker2: ...we're working on it, mr. president.
speaker1: it should only choke on them.

speaker1: i managed to contact the mondoshawan. they deplore the incident, but accept our apologies. 
speaker2: and the stones? did you find them in the wreckage?
speaker1: the-stones weren't aboard the ship.
speaker2: ...what do you mean? the president is all ears.
speaker1: the mondoshawan never fully trusted the
speaker2: excellent!

speaker1: i want your best man on this! 
speaker2: don't worry, sir. i have the perfect one.

speaker1: stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality.. 
speaker2: saved by the bell.
speaker2: ...hello?
speaker3: you're the nastiest dirtbag i know in this stinking city!
speaker2: hi ma...
speaker3: i've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years i've been eating those croquettes.

speaker3: are you listening to me, you ingrate!
speaker2: yes ma..
speaker2: go on... this is gonna take a while!
speaker2: other than that... you all right?
speaker3: ...and now you're making fun of me? i'm warning you! if you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, i'll never forgive you!!
speaker2: i'm coming!. ma, what're you talking about?
speaker3: i get it! you want to make me beg, is that it?
speaker2: all i want is an explanation! i just got in, i lost my job. i smashed my cab. i got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, ma, thanks for asking!! now settle down and explain to me calmly..
speaker3: you just won a trip, you dolt!
speaker2: ma. if i'd won, i'd know about it.

speaker6: ...send in a back-up unit, zone 7!

speaker1: korben is led down the hall by a stewardess. 
speaker2: you are so lucky... loc rhod is the coolest dj in the universe.
speaker3: listen... i don't want to be interviewed. i'd prefer to remain anonymous. the stewardess stops in the corridor.
speaker2: forget anonymous. you'll be doing loc rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!
speaker3: you gotta be kidding!
speaker3: ...hi.
speaker4: does it get any better or what!
speaker4: ...quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! you'll know everything there is to know about the d-man. his dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates. and from what i'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. so tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
speaker3: uh... not really.
speaker4: freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause korben is on the case with a major face... loc rhod rubs up against the stewardess.
speaker4: ...start drooling, ladies! my man here is a sharp-tongued sire who's gonna stroke your every desire.
speaker4: yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's prince of fhloston paradise, the hotel of a thousand and one follies, home of luxury and beauty. a magic fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and bootchie koochie koo... he tosses away his champagne glass.

speaker5: end of transmission.
speaker4: korben sweetheart do me a favor i know this is probably the biggest thing that ever happened to you in your inconsequential life. but i've got a show to do here and it's got to pop. so tomorrow, when we're on air, give me a hand... try to make believe you have more than a one word vocabulary. ok pal? that does it. korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a corner. loc rhod's feet don't touch the ground.
speaker4: crystal.

speaker1: ...mr. dallas... korben dallas? 
speaker2: that's right.
speaker1: the problem is i only have one korben dallas on my list... and he's already checked in. right arm's smile shatters.
speaker2: that's impossible! he's in j... i mean, there must be some mistake. i have my ticket! i'm the real korben dallas! a shrill bell rings out.
speaker2: i want to see your boss! get rid of this window! somebody's made a mistake, goddamnit!
speaker3: this is not an exercise. this is a police control.

speaker1: apipoulai! 
speaker2: not hard to find you...just follow the chaos...
speaker2: leeloo, listen to me... these tickets... they're not mine... i mean they are, but not for vacation like everyone thinks... i'm on an operation... and if i didn't come get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble... i'd love to be on vacation with you... but now.... now i've got to work... and leeloo... i would love to work in peace. leeloo types in "love" on the keyboard.
speaker1: love...
speaker2: yes! but "love" isn't the operative word here, peace is! leeloo types in this new word.
speaker1: peace... and love...
speaker2: sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
speaker1: what is... make love?
speaker2: know what? on that subject maybe you'd be better off asking the screen.

speaker1: ok! finished! 
speaker2: finished what?
speaker1: learning language.
speaker2: which one?
speaker1: all 900.
speaker2: you learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
speaker1: yes! now it's your turn! i learned your language, you have to learn mine!
speaker2: i know how to say "hello". teach me how to say "good-bye", that's all i need.
speaker1: apipoussan!
speaker2: apipoussan?
speaker1: good! do you know how we say "make love"?
speaker2: uh...
speaker1: ...hoppi-hoppa.
speaker2: help...
speaker3: sweet dreams, mr. dallas!
speaker4: mr. loc rhod you have to assume your individual position.
speaker5: i don't want an individual position, i want all positions!
speaker4: we're going to take off soon, mr. rhod!
speaker5: now you're talking!
speaker6: molecular axis authorization. vector 130. destination fhloston.
speaker7: zone 1. 217 locked. the sleep regulator is ok.
speaker8: thanks, miss.
speaker9: tell the ground crew we've got parasites in the landing gear.

speaker1: yeah, it's me... put zorg on. 
speaker2: i'm listening.
speaker1: the real korben dallas is on the plane!
speaker2: this is a joke, right?

speaker1: anti static pressure? 
speaker2: primed.

speaker1: 10 seconds... 
speaker2: power increase.

speaker1: - the engines at full blast. 
speaker2: liftoff. - the copilot pushes a button. - so does zorg. - the engines release their full power. - the stewardess screams in ecstasy.

speaker1: in the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up. 
speaker2: landing gear secure. let's light one up.

speaker1: the thing is sending out radio wavelengths! 
speaker2: what the does it want with radio waves?
speaker1: ...probably wants to make a call!

speaker1: mr. shadow on the line. 
speaker2: yes... zorg here.
speaker3: am i disturbing you?
speaker2: no... not at all. where are you?
speaker3: ...not far, now.
speaker2: really? maybe i can get you on my screen and see you at last! zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.
speaker3: do you have the picture now mr. zorg?
speaker2: got it.
speaker3: how's our deal coming along?
speaker3: money is of no importance... i want the stones!
speaker2: the stones will be here. i'll see to it personally!
speaker3: ...i can't wait to be among you.

speaker1: ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our descent toward fhloston paradise... 
speaker1: i wanted to tell you that...

speaker1: a blinking light goes on. 
speaker2: parasites in zone 1. take a look.

speaker1: my main man! please don't leave me here alone. my head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! get me outta here! 
speaker2: i'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
speaker1: oh, yes! do that! you treat me right, man. tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
speaker2: i don't think this is a good time...
speaker1: ...you got brothers and sisters? what about your dad? tell me about your dad! what was he like? physically?
speaker2: yeah, very big, a giant.
speaker1: i didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...

speaker1: for the concert it says formal attire... i didn't bring... 
speaker1: hello?
speaker2: you little sleaze bag!
speaker1: ...ma???
speaker2: don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
speaker1: ...ma!!!

speaker1: the diva's ship is coming in. 
speaker2: i want maximum security.
speaker1: yes. sir!
speaker2: ok, let's hear it.
speaker3: where was i?
speaker2: what happened?
speaker4: yeah... a 5 foot 7 inch bomb... with green eyes.
speaker3: and the smile of an angel?
speaker3: may i speak to you alone.

speaker1: please forgive this little incident. she wants you to know that she senses great powers in you... in the service of a noble cause... she will give you what you have come to get, but she wants to sing first... one last time... 
speaker1: miss.

speaker1: hello, i'm head of security. everything is in order. you can... 
speaker1: ...make yourselves at home safely.

speaker1: listen, ma! i've only got a few days vacation and i'll be if i'm gonna spend them on the phone. 
speaker1: ...hang on, it's the door. no! i told you i didn't bring anybody! i'm all alone... as usual!
speaker1: ...i'll call you back.
speaker1: here we go again...
speaker2: you know women normally change five times more than men.
speaker1: you get that off the screen?
speaker2: yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
speaker1: you noticed..
speaker2: ok, you can turn around!
speaker1: where you going?
speaker2: i'm going to see the diva sing. what's the matter?... do i look bad?
speaker1: no, not at all! i mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
speaker2: do you know how this works?
speaker1: i have an idea.
speaker1: i told you i need to work in peace.
speaker2: and you can't concentrate with me around?.
speaker1: it's difficult.
speaker1: army issue. i'm sorry.
speaker2: you're nothing but a... a...
speaker1: the words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. i won't be long.
speaker3: hey stud we gotta...
speaker3: korben my man what's happening here? who's the chick? what's the gig? we free forming here? getting funky with the monkey? can i get in on this?
speaker1: no..to all of the above.

speaker1: it's showtime! 
speaker2: the lights dim slowly in the concert hall.

speaker1: yeah!? 
speaker2: flowers for the diva.
speaker1: she's allergic to flowers!!!
speaker2: there's champagne as well...
speaker3: ...my

speaker1: commander, i have a ship with a main malfunction. he requests permission to dock for repairs. 
speaker2: did you check out his registration number?
speaker1: everything's in order.
speaker2: put him in the docking garage and inform the police.

speaker1: permission granted. dock 575. you have an hour. will that be enough time'? 
speaker2: more than enough.

speaker1: i have it. 
speaker2: apipoulai!

speaker1: they were waiting for us! it was an ambush! 
speaker2: if it's war they want it's war they'll get! enact the final plan! all the mangalores their weapons.

speaker1: my compliments, little lady! ...and thanks for doing all the dirty work! i couldn't have done it any better myself! ...now hand over the stones! 
speaker1: nice knowing you.
speaker2: leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

speaker1: nobody move! we're taking over this ship! 
speaker2: i told you...

speaker1: ...mangalores! 
speaker2: send a battalion out immediately!

speaker1: i was sent by the government to help you. 
speaker2: don't worry. this is my fate... how was the concert?
speaker1: i've never heard anything so beautiful in my life.
speaker2: you're a good man...
speaker1: who?
speaker2: the fifth element... the supreme being... your wife...
speaker1: leeloo... is... she's...
speaker2: yes, and more than that... you must give her the stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
speaker1: ...so cornelius was telling the truth!

speaker1: of course i was telling you the truth!... if you had listened to me in the first place, we wouldn't be in this predicament now! 
speaker2: korben wastes two more mangalores.
speaker3: she needs you. she needs your help and
speaker4: ...yeah, so am i.
speaker3: she was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
speaker4: i'll help her, i promise, but i think you should tell me where the stones are!
speaker3: do you love her?
speaker4: i... i don't know! we hardly know each other... it takes time!
speaker3: i don't have time... i need to know.
speaker4: listen, the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her ... i never saw her again.
speaker3: i would like to have died in peace...

speaker1: you tell me to save the world then you go off and leave me in the 
speaker1: come on! you're not gonna die in peace! you're not going to die at all! you hear me? where are the stones?

speaker1: i'm sorry, but... the stones... 
speaker2: they are... with me...
speaker3: stay calm and nobody will get hurt! hands on your head and into the hall!
speaker1: ...the stones are with me?
speaker1: ...in me?
speaker4: don't you think we'd better be going?
speaker5: hey, you! with the others!
speaker1: that's it... i've had... all day people have been sticking guns in my face... korben wraps up the four stones in his shirt.
speaker4: korben man... these dudes are going to waste us if we don't do what they say. korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.
speaker1: you don't do what i say... i'll waste you myself. got it?
speaker4: got it...

speaker1: there's no more resistance. everything's under control. 
speaker2: everybody down!
speaker3: this is amazing! korben, korben dallas, the winner of the gemini croquette

speaker1: it's roy von bacon, the lions center forward joining in the battle... 
speaker2: all this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

speaker1: toss me the balls! 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: the for christ's sake!
speaker3: he wants the balls! you deaf or something?
speaker1: how far is he from here?
speaker4: i'd say about thirty yards to the left.
speaker5: ...and our man korben has literally knocked out the opposition with an amazing 90 foot pitch.
speaker6: thanks for your help.
speaker1: forget it. korben grabs loc rhod and takes him with him.

speaker1: hey, who are you? 
speaker2: the winner of the gemini croquette contest.
speaker2: seven to the left. five to the right.
speaker3: what's he doing?
speaker2: six to the left. one to the right.
speaker4: he's on vacation.
speaker2: we got to find the leader. mangalores don't fight without a leader.

speaker1: found him... 
speaker2: send someone to negotiate!
speaker1: mind if i go? i'm an excellent negotiator.
speaker3: uh... sure, go ahead.
speaker3: we're sending someone in who's authorized to negotiate.

speaker1: anyone else want to negotiate? 
speaker2: where'd he learn to negotiate like that?

speaker1: you're probably very angry with me and i quite understand. but i want you to know i'm fighting for a noble cause. 
speaker2: yeah, i know... to save the world... but right now all i want to do is save leeloo.
speaker1: leeloo's in trouble?
speaker2: when is she not in trouble?
speaker1: uh.. have you tried the diva's suite?

speaker1: more trouble? 
speaker2: nothing i can't fix myself.

speaker1: leeloo? 
speaker2: korben... her voice is too weak, korben can't hear her.
speaker3: korben man... what the is this?
speaker1: a molecular bomb.
speaker3: and, uh, what're these numbers clicking by?
speaker4: probably the time remaining before it explodes.
speaker5: the lights flicker.
speaker6: this is a type a alert. for security reasons the hotel must be evacuated. please proceed calmly to the lifeboats located in the main hallways.

speaker1: maybe we oughta be going, what do you think? 
speaker2: not without leeloo.
speaker1: like d-man, i hate to bother you but uh, like, we're down to 2 minutes here...
speaker2: it's the latest model.. i've never seen one before... it works off a magnetic coded card... let's see if i can rig it up.

speaker1: hey! what are you doing? the bomb! 
speaker2: don't worry, i'm here now!
speaker2: just relax. i've got the stones. everything's going to be fine.
speaker1: like korben, can i have 30 seconds of your time here?
speaker2: i'll be right back.
speaker3: allow me...
speaker3: just for the fun of it.
speaker3: well, what do we have here? is this korben dallas? the famous winner of the gemini croquette contest? or is this korben dallas from special section sent by old lindberg himself.
speaker3: ...in any event, whoever you are, i was glad to meet you.
speaker3: ...a 3000 round clip! i didn't fire off 3000 rounds... did i?
speaker2: don't you know how to count. it's not all that hard. watch!
speaker2: one! that's for trying to kill me!
speaker2: two! that's for firing me! three! that's for pushing around a priest! and the rest is for what you did to my wife!

speaker1: we're outta here! he picks leeloo up in his arms. 
speaker2: are you nuts, father? that hurts! i can't feel my teeth.
speaker3: doesn't matter all you need are your legs.

speaker1: two minutes to complete evacuation... 
speaker2: zorg starts to come around.
speaker3: korben sets leeloo down.

speaker1: one minute to total evacuation... 
speaker2: you know how to fly this thing?
speaker3: it's like a cab isn't it?
speaker1: 30 seconds...
speaker3: anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?

speaker1: found it? 
speaker2: i don't even know what i'm looking for!
speaker1: it! hold tight!

speaker1: solid little jobs, aren't they? 
speaker2: beep. end of transmission.
speaker3: the best show i ever did!

speaker1: how's that? can you hear me better now? 
speaker2: yes, mr. zorg, i hear you perfectly!
speaker1: who gives a i didn't come here to listen to music! listen up instead of running off at the mouth!
speaker2: yes, sir!
speaker1: dispatch me another zfx200 immediately.
speaker2: right away, sir. i'll send you a new one to the hotel.
speaker1: i'm not at the hotel!
speaker1: hello?...
speaker3: battery dead.
speaker1: stay calm.... stay calm...
speaker4: general munro enters the office with a smile.
speaker5: major dallas has the five elements on board. the priest is guiding them directly to the temple.
speaker6: thank we've been saved!
speaker7: mr. president.
speaker6: yes? now, what?

speaker1: apipoulai.. 
speaker2: i'm so very sad.
speaker1: why? we did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
speaker2: five hundred wars... arms... drugs... money...
speaker1: i told you not to read all that crap!
speaker2: protect life... until death.
speaker3: there's a general on the phone...

speaker1: munro here. president lindberg wants to talk to you. hold the line. 
speaker2: major, first off, i want to thank you, in my name and in the name of the federation...

speaker1: for the praiseworthy courage you have shown us! i'd like to congratulate general munro for his choice. he found the ideal man for such a... 
speaker2: so now what's the problem?
speaker1: there's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter heading straight for the earth. and we have no idea how to stop it! ...that's the problem.
speaker2: how much time before the collision?
speaker3: if its speed remains constant... in an hour and 57 minutes.

speaker1: you're all safe. thanks be to 
speaker2: later, david! later! there's not a minute to lose!

speaker1: they just landed in the desert. 
speaker2: how much time is left?

speaker1: uh, this one... must be water! 
speaker2: don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
speaker1: theoretically, yes! the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... i don't have the reference book. i've never seen the stones work!
speaker2: match the symbols!
speaker3: what is this some kinda game? like chess?
speaker2: no. it's much simpler. if we don't figure out where these stones go in five minutes, we're all dead! think you got it?
speaker2: there's no light! you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
speaker1: yes, of course, but... the stones are shut!
speaker2: and you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
speaker1: that's what i'm saying.
speaker4: the dark planet closes in on earth rapidly.
speaker5: korben leans over leeloo.
speaker2: leeloo? the stones! we have to open them! how does it work?
speaker6: the wind blows... the fire burns...
speaker2: i know all that, leeloo! i'm talking about the stones.
speaker6: ...the rain falls...
speaker2: the rain falls... the wind blows?
speaker2: try and figure out how this thing opens, instead of staring at me like that! loc rhod starts feeling the stone all around.
speaker3: i'm looking, i'm looking.

speaker1: ...three minutes. 
speaker2: we've lost contact with them.

speaker1: ...we'll never make it. 
speaker1: it... it moved! korben! korben!
speaker2: what did you say? what did you do?
speaker1: nothing! swear to i didn't do nothing!
speaker2: look, you did something that set it off. try to remember. concentrate. tell me exactly what you did!!
speaker1: i was like this... with my hands here and... i said, "we'll never make it!" that's all! nothing happens.
speaker2: is that all?
speaker1: yeah... then i sighed... like this.
speaker2: the wind! the wind blows...
speaker2: quickly, everyone on a stone! water for water! fire for fire! earth for earth!
speaker2: don't breathe.

speaker1: it's up to you now, angel! 
speaker2: i'm so tired...
speaker1: you can sleep tomorrow... come on...
speaker2: i want to sleep... forever...
speaker1: leeloo! listen to me! i'll take you on a vacation afterwards! a real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. come on! you can do it!
speaker3: come on leeloo! come on!

speaker1: leeloo! if you don't get on with the program we're all gonna die! and that's not on my agenda for today. 
speaker2: what's the use of saving lives...
speaker1: you're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
speaker2: ...like love...
speaker1: exactly.
speaker2: but i don't know love... i'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.

speaker1: i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... there is no need for me other than this. i'm immortal but i have no life. 
speaker2: yes, you do! i need you. more than you can imagine! stand up straight!
speaker1: why?... why would you need me?
speaker2: because...
speaker3: tell her, for sake!

speaker1: because... 
speaker2: tell me...
speaker1: i love you...

speaker1: mr. president, let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh, who runs the center. 
speaker2: it's an honor to receive you. mr. president.
speaker3: yes.. well? where are our two heroes?
speaker2: they were so tired from their ordeal that we put them in the reactor this morning..
speaker3: i have 19 more meetings after this one professor..
speaker4: of course.. let me see if they're revived.
speaker5: we go live in one minute, mr. president.
speaker2: i.. uh.. they need five more minutes, mr. president.
speaker5: no ma'am... i tried... no ma'am...
speaker3: who is it?
speaker5: some woman... claims she's korben's mother...
speaker3: give it here...
speaker3: mrs. dallas, this in the president. on behalf of the entire federation, i would like to thank...
speaker6: don't pull that with me, finger... i'd recognize that trash can voice of yours in a dark alley during a rain storm. you tell that worthless no account son of mine he should plotz for the way he's ignored his mother... when i think of all i sacrificed for him...
