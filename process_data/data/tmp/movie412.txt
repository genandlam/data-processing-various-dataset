speaker1: i'm serious, honey. don't get out of my sight, all right? i want you to stay right by me. will you do that for me?
speaker2: nods solemnly. gene reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
speaker1: we made it.
speaker2: we made it.

speaker1: skate-boarders i don't mind, even though they dress like idiots, but when i see some pin-head on rollerblades, i get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em. 
speaker2: keep your eyes peeled.
speaker1: what about them?

speaker1: too old. 
speaker2: him!
speaker1: if you ever had an idea it would die of malnutrition. first those blue hairs then some spic. leave this to me. i know people. it's my job. i'm a people person.

speaker2: nods.
speaker1: let' s do it.

speaker1: whoops.

speaker2: perfect.
speaker1: could i see some identification, sir?
speaker3: what?
speaker2: i.d. could we see some?
speaker3: uh, sure. what's, what's the problem? will a driver's license do?
speaker1: that'll do just fine.

speaker1: is this about those kids? look, i'm sorry about that. but they darn near... 
speaker2: you're from santa maria, mr. watson?
speaker1: yes.
speaker3: where's that?
speaker1: near lompoc, north. what's...
speaker2: come with us, sir.
speaker1: i'd like to know what...

speaker2: you don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
speaker3: come with me, honey.
speaker1: hey! i'll take the girl. i'll take the girl!
speaker2: don't worry. she's good with kids.

speaker1: you stole that. 
speaker2: no, i didn't. i confiscated it. there's a difference.

speaker1: what is going on? 
speaker2: into the van, mr. watson. front seat.
speaker3: let's get your seatbelt on. always gotta wear your seatbelt, isn't that right?
speaker4: i want my daddy.
speaker4: gene climbs into the front passenger seat.
speaker3: there's your daddy. see? we're your daddy's friends.
speaker2: that's right. the policeman is your friend. isn't that right, daddy?
speaker2: daddy?
speaker1: yes. it's ok, lynn. these are our friends.
speaker3: hey, would you look at this crazy car? everybody has their own radio. what do you think of that?
speaker4: everybody does?
speaker3: yep. and you can listen to it without anybody else listening. let's try it out.
speaker3: this is what they call the jack. hi, jack!
speaker4: laughs.
speaker3: it goes in that little hole.

speaker1: let me do it. 
speaker1: it's loud!
speaker2: removes a pro label machine from under the seat. she begins to type in several characters.
speaker3: let's get down to business.
speaker4: who are you? you're not the police.
speaker5: brilliant.
speaker3: pay attention, mr. watson. pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
speaker4: you wouldn't...
speaker5: try us.
speaker4: get your hands off her.

speaker1: mr. watson, you're not paying attention. your daughter's life depends on you. do you understand that? 
speaker2: yes, yes, i understand.
speaker1: good.
speaker1: this is for you. in it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. it is her itinerary. she is presently - are you listening, mr. watson?
speaker2: yes, i'm listening.
speaker1: she is presently at the bonaventure hotel. that's right near here.
speaker1: when you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the bonaventure hotel. then you will take this.

speaker1: ...and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there. not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. i'd recommend you empty the gun into her. close up. got all that? 
speaker2: you're out of your mind.
speaker1: what's your point?
speaker2: i will do no such thing.
speaker1: yes, you will, mr. watson.
speaker3: don't worry. we'll take good care of the kid.
speaker1: it is now 12:16. if the woman in the picture is alive at 1:30... ...i call my partner, your daughter is dead.
speaker1: and what happens if i don't call you?
speaker3: i kill her anyway.

speaker1: did you hear that, mr. watson? do you understand? 
speaker1: the woman in the picture...
speaker1: ...or your daughter.
speaker2: oh, my
speaker1: can't help her, mr. watson. only you can help her.
speaker3: only you.
speaker1: you're wasting time.
speaker4: where is my daddy going?
speaker3: he's going to help the police. your daddy is going to be a hero.
speaker4: my daddy is going to be a hero? like power rangers?

speaker1: let's test this thing. you on? 
speaker2: reading you.
speaker1: you'11 need some cash. i'll hang onto this for the time being. oh, and...
speaker1: you'll need these.
speaker1: get moving, mr. watson. time's a wastin'.

speaker1: mama! 
speaker2: you talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead. do it.
speaker3: go ahead, sugar die.
speaker3: lynn calling daddy. lynn calling daddy. come in, daddy.
speaker4: lynn!
speaker5: i can hear you good. can you hear me?
speaker4: yes. yes, i can hear you.
speaker2: that's enough.
speaker3: 'daddy has to go now.
speaker5: he has to say "over and out". daddy, you have to say "over and out".
speaker4: over and out.
speaker2: look at your watch. look at it! at one-thirty your little girl is dead. say it with me. at one-thirty my little girl is dead. say it. say it!
speaker4: at one thirty my little girl is dead.
speaker2: unless you do what you're told. go do it!
speaker2: he pushes gene on, toward a cab.
speaker2: and don't forget i'll be watching you.

speaker1: where to, sir? 
speaker2: the bonaventure. the bonaventure hotel. do you know where that is?

speaker1: amtrack? 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: you just come in on amtrack?
speaker2: uh, yes..
speaker1: business or pleasure?
speaker2: business.

speaker1: where'd you come from? 
speaker2: san diego.
speaker1: oh, san diego? i've thought about moving to san diego. it's hard to make a living in this town. these short hops. can't make a dime on 'em. to lax, pasadena, then i can make a buck. these little hops cost me money.
speaker2: sorry.
speaker1: 's okay. what do you think?
speaker2: huh?
speaker1: better in san diego? more opportunity there? what?
speaker2: i really don't know. i don't live there. i was just visiting...a grave.
speaker1: aw, too bad.
speaker1: somebody close?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: the grave. somebody close?

speaker1: wife. ex-wife. almost ex. we were separated. she was thinking about a divorce. 
speaker2: gene leans forward.
speaker1: look...i've... i've got a problem. a big problem...
speaker3: oh, yeah?
speaker3: watch it, buddy!

speaker1: i'd love to hear about your problem, but the ride's over. three-fifty. 
speaker1: three-fifty. i hope your problem doesn't have anything to do with my three-fifty.

speaker1: what do i want with an accountant? 
speaker2: i got one for the airport. you free?
speaker1: you bet.

speaker1: oh, my oh, no. 
speaker2: and an addendum:

speaker1: could you tell me where the emerald bay room is? 
speaker2: third floor. yellow stairwell. follow the signs.
speaker1: oh, thanks. thanks a lot.
speaker2: no problem.

speaker1: gene plows on through... 
speaker2: whoops!
speaker2: nice body check.
speaker2: he slides a familiar hand around her waist.
speaker2: you know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers. they are felons and they should be treated as such. a drivers license is a privilege, not a right.

speaker1: excuse me, is the...thing over? 
speaker2: yes. you didn't miss much. the food...chicken again.
speaker1: eleanor grant is gone?
speaker2: yes. nice speech. but it's the same at all these...
speaker3: check your itinerary. move along.

speaker1: this says "invitation only". 
speaker2: of course you're invited. you're a big donor to the campaign. they love you.
speaker2: this'11 get you in anywhere. red elevator. thirty-fifth floor.
speaker1: where did you get these? who are you?
speaker2: i'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.

speaker1: they-didn't hear a word i said. the mike was too low on the podium. 
speaker2: how much did we pay for that room?

speaker1: we didn't. 
speaker2: somebody did.
speaker3: a have nolin pre-check the pa systems.
speaker4: excuse me, sir, this car is for the governor. you can take the next one.
speaker2: don't you dare, franco. this is one of our biggest supporters.
speaker2: eleanor grant, gubernatorial incumbent. that's a mouthful isn't- it? i love saying that.
speaker2: whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch? i'm about to bust as it is.

speaker1: we'll just walk through, do a little grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con. 
speaker2: we are on the third floor.
speaker3: governor...
speaker3: i need your help.
speaker4: what can i do for you mr....watson?
speaker3: its'...ah...about my daughter....
speaker2: we are on the fourth floor.
speaker5: room for one more?
speaker4: i think we can accommodate you.
speaker4: eleanor grant, gubernatorial incumbent.

speaker1: yes? 
speaker2: she ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
speaker1: of course. i wish everything were that easy.
speaker3: i've got the pen if you've got the paper.
speaker3: how about that?
speaker3: is that something precious?
speaker2: no, that's,..that's fine

speaker1: what's her name? 
speaker2: her name? her name is lynn.
speaker3: it's funny. i don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic.
speaker3: if it wasn't for double a batteries i'd be in big trouble.

speaker1: she was right in front of you! what's wrong with you!? 
speaker1: are you 'fucking with me!?
speaker2: the gun...
speaker1: what about the gun?
speaker2: it wasn't loaded. i didn't put the bullets in it.
speaker1: you...

speaker1: that's pretty good. 
speaker2: i've done much better ones than this.
speaker1: you have, huh?
speaker2: oh, yes. i'll show you. i have much more colors at home.
speaker1: that's good. that's good, sweetie pie.

speaker1: having a rough day? down at the heels as they...? 
speaker1: you don't see your face, you don't pay!

speaker1: having a rough day? down at the heels as they say? what you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today. 
speaker1: take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. put the world in perspective. gene lets huey usher him into a chair.

speaker1: so, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in the city of angels? 
speaker2: i'm...i'm visiting.
speaker1: what do you do, if i may be so bold?
speaker2: i'm just an accountant.
speaker1: don't denigrate yourself, my friend. where would the government be without accountants? they wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?

speaker1: no. no, it doesn't. 
speaker2: hey, huey, how's it hangin'?
speaker3: it's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it.
speaker1: i have to do something.
speaker3: what's that? you have to speak up. i'm a little deaf in this ear. between that and my wooden leg i'm a mess. compliments of the united states army artillery corps.
speaker1: i said i have to do something.
speaker3: i'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
speaker1: is within himself.

speaker1: drove me crazy. there must have been one on me. i didn't add up so she left. that's what attracted me to her in the first place. she made up her mind and she did it. she wouldn't sit around waiting for...whatever. she'd do something. she'd do something. 
speaker2: yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. wears like iron. you're a wise man. there ya' go. two bucks.
speaker2: you got anything smaller?
speaker1: keep it.
speaker2: it's a twenty.
speaker1: keep it.
speaker2: well...thanks muchly...
speaker1: can i get out to flower street from here?
speaker2: sure. go down past the bar. take you right out there.
speaker2: huey nods toward the bar.
speaker1: thanks.

speaker1: you get another chance in ten minutes. 
speaker2: then i have time for a drink.
speaker1: all right, mr. watson, but make it just one. i don't want you...

speaker1: so where was i? 
speaker2: i don't know. something about the governor's new regime.
speaker1: oh yeah. she's dumping the good old boys like yesterday's newspapers.

speaker1: the white boys are in for it. when they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the governor's office look like the united nations. 
speaker1: we're talking custer's last stand here. the only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the rain forest.

speaker1: lynn! 
speaker2: shhh. you'll wake the baby up.

speaker1: what we have here is what they call a mexican standoff. the thing you gotta ask yourself is, "what's behind the seat?" now, a twenty-two'd go right through it, but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there's a good chance it'd get screwed up somewhere along the way, miss the target. maybe a thirty-eight? a thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces. they'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit. how's about a three-fifty-seven? it'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away. what do you think? what's my poison? gene look at lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand. he lowers the gun, defeated. 
speaker1: well it's a comfort to know you've got the co-jones to pull that thing out. whether you've got the to pull the trigger we've still got to see.

speaker1: pool deck? 
speaker2: fourth floor. take that escalator.

speaker1: my wife is not interested in negative campaigning. she wants to accentuate the positive. i don't know about you but i find that refreshing. 
speaker2: have you ever thought of running for office yourself?
speaker1: me?
speaker1: i'm just a business man.

speaker1: what would you do in my place? 
speaker2: me?
speaker2: the would be dead. course i ain't sayin' which
speaker1: there's a plot to kill the governor. if you don't believe me, check that guy right there. he has a gun.
speaker3: so do you, mr. watson.
speaker3: you got this under control?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker3: it doesn't look like it.

speaker1: it's under control. 
speaker2: it better be. officer trust walks away.
speaker1: i oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but i'm going to give you a break because you're an amateur.
speaker3: gentlemen...
speaker1: yeah, thanks. have a cracker.
speaker1: have a cracker, mr. watson. gene woodenly takes one. the waiter moves on.
speaker1: there was this guy. big guy. irish- italian. red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch.
speaker1: nobody could make me laugh like him. we closed more bars together than i can count. he was my pal. i loved that crazy mick, i'm not ashamed to say it. but he was fuck-up. he had this image of himself. thought he was con man. always trying to shave the edge. nickel and dime. i'll always miss him. tell me why.

speaker1: what...? 
speaker2: tell me why i miss him.
speaker1: he's dead?
speaker2: that's right. he's dead. tell me why.
speaker1: how should i...?
speaker2: tell me why he's dead.
speaker1: you killed him.
speaker2: that's right, i killed him. he up one too many times so i put a bullet in his eye. then i put two more into him just to make sure. now that was somebody i loved.
speaker2: i loved that but i got the call and i put him down like a sick animal. so if you've got any doubts about what's going to happen if you don't deliver let me tell you something. i'd make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black irish meat.

speaker1: do what you're supposed to do. do it now. 
speaker1: 

speaker1: ...a woman who can only be characterized as a one-of-a-kind. 
speaker2: feeling better?
speaker1: an iconoclast with class...
speaker2: the elevator. you weren't feeling well.
speaker1: a genuine lady who's not afraid to get into the trenches...
speaker2: are you better now?
speaker1: ...and go to the mat with greedy special interests...

speaker1: the finest governor our state has ever had... 
speaker1: my friend and yours, governor eleanor grant!
speaker2: my wife always said i had a problem trusting people.
speaker3: well, you can trust eleanor samara grant.
speaker2: you don't understand. i'm going to trust you. and you have to trust me.
speaker3: yes, you're right, i don't understand.
speaker2: look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
speaker3: sure, sure, i'll help you. let me get mr. white. i'm sure he can assist you, he's our...

speaker1: no! you have to listen to me. 
speaker2: i'm listening, i'm listening.

speaker1: please...please...you have to believe me... they have my daughter. they want me to kill eleanor grant â— or they'll kill my daughter. 
speaker2: all right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
speaker1: no! you can't! they're in on it.
speaker2: i don't see how they could be in on it. they're the best. they're hand- picked.

speaker1: i don't know. one of them is following me. if he knew what i'd just told you they'd... 
speaker1: look, how did i get in here with this!?
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: you've got to trust me. i'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. she's only six. she's just a little girl. please, please, trust me.
speaker2: it's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
speaker1: you're right, it is. here.
speaker1: will you trust me now?
speaker2: i guess i'll have to. come on, there's one person we can go to.

speaker1: the man following me has a walkie- talkie. if he sees i'm not here he'll call his partner. i do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter. 
speaker2: he'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. wait a minute.
speaker3: ...i remember that horrible night as if it were yesterday. a phone call pulling me out of sleep, the terrible news...

speaker1: my husband and child senselessly killed by a drunk driver. 
speaker2: we've got about ten minutes.
speaker3: are you sure?
speaker2: i've heard this speech a lot. come on. we'll take care of him. we will.
speaker3: but...
speaker2: trust me. you asked me for help. let me help. trust me.
speaker3: okay...

speaker1: hey. 
speaker1: i think you better put that away.
speaker2: i think you're right.

speaker1: but tragedy, if it doesn't destroy us, has a curious way of giving us strength. 
speaker1: i doubt if i would be before you now, if i hadn't been put through that crucible of loss.

speaker1: and though i can never forget william and bill junior or the love i felt for them... 
speaker1: mr. smith cuts a wake through the crowd.
speaker1: i have found joy again in serving this great state. i have found love again in my second husband brendan...

speaker1: ms. brooks ... 
speaker2: is he in?
speaker1: yes, ma'am.
speaker3: who is this? are you sure we can trust him?
speaker2: i'm sure. it's her husband. he's her campaign manager.
speaker4: what is it? is there a problem?

speaker1: we have to hurry. 
speaker2: i know. brendan, listen to me. someone is trying to kill eleanor.
speaker3: what? what are you talking about?
speaker2: we need people we can "trust. we only have a few moments...
speaker3: this is...this is insane. how do you know this?
speaker1: i know it because i'm the one who's supposed to kill her.
speaker3: you are!? you brought this man here!? you brought this man to my room!?
speaker2: i had to. her security people may be involved...

speaker1: is there a problem, brendan? 
speaker2: there certainly is. this man says he's been hired to kill eleanor.
speaker3: not hired. they're blackmailing me.
speaker1: who is this "they"?
speaker3: i don't...i don't know. please, mr. grant! they have my daughter. i'm not some lunatic. your wife is in trouble. someone is trying to kill her. someone is trying to make me kill her. please, listen...
speaker1: and on the strength of this story, you bring this man to brendan's suite? does that show good judgment, ms. brooks? i'm just a friend of brendan's, but it seems to me...
speaker4: he brought a gun onto the pool deck.
speaker1: what?
speaker4: he got onto the pool deck with a gun. how did he get past her security carrying a
speaker1: i see. where is this gun?
speaker5: have it.

speaker1: well, is it real? do we know anything about it? 
speaker2: it looks real. i don't know anything about guns.
speaker1: could i see it?
speaker1: my goodness. it certainly looks real.
speaker1: what's your opinion? you're the expert in these matters, supposedly.

speaker1: christ! 
speaker2: calmly, staring at
speaker3: yeah, i'd say it's real.
speaker4: are you out of your mind!?
speaker4: the door opens. officer trust slides in quickly.
speaker2: help me get her off the rug.
speaker1: what have you done to me!? christ almighty!
speaker5: no!
speaker2: you up.
speaker4: that's enough.
speaker2: you want me to kill your kid!? you want me to kill you!?

speaker1: i killed you. 
speaker2: you up.

speaker1: you nearly killed him, too, you 
speaker2: nearly doesn't count.
speaker3: i'm on record. i never wanted this. i wanted simplicity; a telescopic sight, a powerful rifle, but no. what was good enough for oswald wasn't good enough for you two. you had to get fancy. drag some shmuck in off the street, stick a gun in his hand.
speaker1: it's academic now. she had to be killed.
speaker2: what were you going to do, brendan? lock her in a closet? you're in the kitchen now. get used to the heat. he's been seen all over the hotel, looking like some loony tunes. we even got him on video. it'll work. don't worry about it.
speaker1: is he awake?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker3: oh great. why don't we just give him our home phone numbers while we're at it?

speaker1: it doesn't matter what he hears. 
speaker1: that's what it looks like. she was alive a minute ago. now she's dead. because you wouldn't do what i told you to do.
speaker2: get going. you've only got a few minutes to pull it together.
speaker2: it's too late for that.
speaker3: there is a dead woman on my bathroom floor!
speaker4: what about it? she's eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic. some, anonymous loser who went over the edge.
speaker3: only thing better would be if he were a postal worker.
speaker5: he won't be doing any work once i get through with him.
speaker2: and in a few months you're in the governor's mansion. the people'd make you king of california if they could.
speaker2: brendan grant laughs.

speaker1: i'm not stupid.. i know how this is supposed, to work. 
speaker2: do you now, mr. watson?
speaker1: i kill her - and you kill me.
speaker2: keep your voice down.
speaker1: even if you don't, her security men will.

speaker1: how am i supposed to get away? 
speaker2: that's not my problem, mr. watson he gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it.
speaker2: come back.
speaker1: how do i know you won't kill my daughter once i'm gone?

speaker1: come back....fucking radio. 
speaker2: i told you she'd be alright, if you do your job.
speaker3: and i'm supposed to trust you?
speaker1: what choice do you have?
speaker1: after you.

speaker1: look out there! you see the van? 
speaker1: you see it?!
speaker1: come back.
speaker1: yeah.
speaker1: do it! he jabs the walkie-talkie next to gene's ear.
speaker2: daddy...?
speaker3: lynn!
speaker1: security. take the next car.
speaker1: again.
speaker3: no, please...
speaker1: you got one last chance. half an hour and that kid is dead. i'll kill her myself. i'll rip her head off right in front of you!

speaker1: daddy, did you hear me scream? 
speaker1: she told me to scream as loud as i could. did you hear me?

speaker1: having a rough day? down at the heels as they say? what you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today. 
speaker1: so, are you a visitor or are you lucky enough to...

speaker1: you got a complaint? 
speaker2: you remember me?
speaker1: i remember. the big tipper.
speaker2: something is going to happen. when it's over you'll know what i was talking about.

speaker2: don't you threaten me.
speaker1: what are you going to do about it, shoot me?
speaker2: you know what i'm gonna do.

speaker4: to be a hero?
speaker1: no, honey, not to be a hero. but i want you to remember something for me, all right?
speaker4: all right.
speaker1: he's doing it for you. no matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.

speaker1: that's enough. 
speaker2: will you promise me that?
speaker3: i promise.
speaker2: all right. kisses to you.
speaker3: no...kisses to you.
speaker2: no. kisses to you.
speaker3: no, kisses to...
speaker1: i don't care who the you do it for just so you do it. hey.
speaker1: you done yet?
speaker4: just about. he gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away.
speaker4: two dollars, if it pleases you.

speaker1: it doesn't. i remember when it was a quarter. 
speaker1: twenty-five minutes.

speaker1: thanks for the tip. 
speaker1: mister, what are you dragging me into?
speaker2: i'm not dragging you into anything. i don't expect...
speaker1: cover your mouth.
speaker2: what?
speaker1: this gorilla's watching you, is that right?
speaker2: that's right.
speaker1: then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. i don't want him twisting my arm off.
speaker1: that was your kid on the walkie- talkie?

speaker1: my daughter. they have her in a van across the street. they say they'll kill her if i don't do something for them. 
speaker2: in twenty-five minutes in the california ballroom.
speaker1: there was a woman. she was trying to help me. i watched him murder her.
speaker2: what are you supposed to do?
speaker1: kill the governor.
speaker2: i knew i should have packed up and gone home as soon as i got that twenty. what am i supposed to do about this situation?
speaker1: one of them is in on it. he might even be in charge. her security is in on it. there's only one person i know for sure isn't in on it.
speaker2: who?
speaker1: the governor. if i could just talk to her...
speaker2: oh, ...
speaker1: no way, there's nothing you can do to help me.

speaker1: then why'd you drag me into it? 
speaker2: it's my kid. i've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
speaker2: it's about time i did. i was one of those guys, workaholics. i worked my off for them - my wife, my daughter. that's just what i thought i was supposed to do.
speaker1: yeah, all right, listen...
speaker2: so when she wanted a divorce...i was...i didn't know what i'd done wrong. i didn't see it. i didn't see it.... huey takes his wooden brush and whacks gene on the foot, snapping him from his downward spiral.
speaker1: why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
speaker2: i'm sorry. you understand i don't mind dying if i could save my daughter. i mean that.
speaker1: yeah, now listen. i can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. you go down get yourself something to drink. make sure godzilla there, follows you.
speaker2: what are you going to do?

speaker1: i haven't the faintest idea. go on now. i'll get word to you. 
speaker2: if nothing else, someone heard my story.
speaker2: keep the change.
speaker1: don't think i won't.

speaker1: ...and time is running out... 
speaker2: give me a ...a gingerale?

speaker1: man, i thought she was going to get out the violins. 
speaker2: no if i hear that stop the violence routine one more time i'm going to shoot somebody.
speaker3: here's your ginger ale, sir.
speaker2: they're all the same.
speaker2: you know what bothers me?

speaker1: when they get all weepy eyed about the "ordinary citizen", the "regular joe", the "normal american". gimme a break. there ain't no such animal. we're a nation of two hundred forty million special interest groups. 
speaker1: gene stands.
speaker2: well, i'm just a regular guy.
speaker1: is that right?
speaker2: yeah, that's right. but i've built a good solid business out of nothing. don't underestimate the regular guy.
speaker3: sir, you haven't paid.
speaker2: it's on the special interest at the end of the bar.
speaker3: hey, sir, don't make me call a cop.
speaker4: left field bleachers heard from.
speaker5: laughs.

speaker1: where is he? did you lose him? 
speaker2: shut up.

speaker1: c'mon, ladies. no time to be shy. 
speaker1: gustino! drop 'em!
speaker1: and cover up them socks. man, who dresses you?
speaker2: fue.

speaker1: meet irene. 
speaker2: hi.
speaker1: irene is going to help.
speaker2: thank you.
speaker2: where am i going?

speaker1: you said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing. 
speaker2: yeah.
speaker1: you're going to go see her.
speaker2: what!?

speaker1: you sure she's asleep? 
speaker2: i took up extra pillows. she take a nap before her big speech.
speaker3: what am i supposed to say to her?
speaker1: it'll come to you. see if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. save us all considerable embarrassment.
speaker1: irene...?

speaker1: excuse me... 
speaker2: who the are you?

speaker1: no, please. 
speaker1: mrs. grant, governor...i won't hurt you.
speaker2: my security people are right next door.
speaker1: i appreciate that.
speaker2: one loud scream will bring them in here instantly. you won't get very far. think it over.
speaker1: if i were here to hurt you i would have done it already.
speaker2: that's...a comfort to hear.
speaker1: i have a problem.
speaker2: ah.
speaker1: only you can help me. i'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, mrs. grant.

speaker1: i remember you...in the elevator. 
speaker2: that's right.
speaker1: you were very nervous.
speaker2: it was because i had this...in my pocket he slowly pulls out the gun. she takes it in.
speaker2: i need you to listen to me. carefully. three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what i have to say.
speaker2: krista brooks is dead.
speaker1: how do you know that?
speaker2: i saw her die. she was shot. with this gun.

speaker1: you shot her? 
speaker2: no.
speaker1: who did?
speaker2: i don't know. the only thing i know about him is that he works for your husband.
speaker1: what?
speaker2: and your husband works for somebody else.
speaker1: what the are you saying?
speaker3: he looks back to the governor.

speaker1: he's gone. 
speaker1: hey, gustino, what takes you so long? you need to eat more fiber.
speaker2: you got anything to read?

speaker1: i knew you wouldn't believe me. 
speaker2: i said i'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. you're telling me my people are in a plot against me. you're telling me my husband wants me killed. what do you expect?

speaker1: i don't blame you. i don't have any proof. but nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. you can't be totally oblivious. you must suspect something. you're doing things which are making people angry. people who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs. you know them better than me. how much does it mean to them? how far would they go to hang onto it? 
speaker1: there's only one way to find out for sure. try to cancel the last speech.
speaker2: i'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
speaker1: it's the last chance they have for me to kill you. try to get out of it. they won't let you. they can't. try to change the schedule and you'll know i'm right. what have you got to lose? it comes down to who you trust, them or me? test them.
speaker2: i love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
speaker1: this? i've never even fired one.
speaker2: indeed.

speaker1: what is it, governor!? what's wrong!? 
speaker2: i...i'm afraid i've had a bad dream, franco.

speaker1: well? 
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker1: what are you going to do now?

speaker1: i don't know. i have to get back. gene keeps moving fast. huey limps to keep up 
speaker2: what are you going to do!?
speaker1: this is about power and you haven't got any. there's nothing more you can do. i'm sorry. thanks for trying.

speaker1: where is he? 
speaker2: in the john.

speaker1: get moving. 
speaker2: you' oughta learn to relax. i told you i've got it under control.
speaker1: it's time. it's time now.

speaker1: where are we going? 
speaker2: not very far, honey-pie. not far at all.

speaker1: out of there, mr. watson! your time's up! 
speaker1: you forgot to wash your hands.
speaker1: i've got faith in you, mr. watson. i know you're not just a regular guy, see, i know that. even if you don't know it yourself. maybe that's why i picked you.

speaker1: hey, el, how's the head? 
speaker2: eleanor.
speaker3: lousy. and i have siesta hair. i'm thinking of canceling the speech.
speaker1: it's an important speech.
speaker2: i'd say critical, not that it's any of my business.
speaker3: it's just another speech in a tower of babel so high that nimrod himself would be put to shame. cancel. make my apologies.

speaker1: excuse me. 
speaker2: i'll trot along. nice to see you, eleanor.
speaker1: during a campaign every speech is important. this is free media exposure. primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
speaker3: what's he doing here?
speaker1: who, him? just visiting.
speaker4: hings have changed, brendan. i thought you understood that.
speaker1: he's my friend. and he did help you to get elected, after all.
speaker3: don't remind me.
speaker1: what happened here?
speaker3: nothing. i broke a lamp.
speaker1: eleanor, please. i'll put it this way. this speech or a half-dozen rubber chicken-fund raisers. what do you say?

speaker1: truth is, besides the headache i've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. make my apologies. 
speaker2: come on, el, you're a trooper. i'll get you some pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to sacramento. this is no time to lay down on the job. i don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. look what happened to bush. tell you what, if you want to blow off the sacramento speech, fine. but do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
speaker1: all right, i'll do it.
speaker2: that's my girl.
speaker1: but i want to make some changes. get krista in here right away won't you?
speaker2: aw, gee. i sent her on an errand.
speaker1: you sent my assistant on an errand.
speaker2: i've been a bad boy.

speaker1: we have with us today the first woman governor of our great state... 
speaker1: governor eleanor samara grant. what can i say about her....that won't get me in trouble when i get home tonight. laughter.

speaker1: charlie. charlie. charlie, are you reading me? 
speaker2: she's a woman who loves our great state.
speaker1: charlie... i can't get on this stupid radio.

speaker1: a brilliant legislator. 
speaker1: ...who will soon win her second term as the greatest governor california has ever seen!
speaker2: somebody's going to ave to run down to the truck. tell them this radio's
speaker2: i can't get through. walkie-talkies don't work from here. there's too much concrete and stuff.

speaker1: ladies and gentlemen... 
speaker2: nothin's getting out.

speaker1: that's my job. i'm your babysitter. 
speaker2: i'm not a baby.
speaker1: you're a big girl, huh?
speaker2: i'm not a big girl but i'm not a baby.
speaker1: close your eyes.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: i've got something for you.
speaker2: a surprise?
speaker1: you ask too many questions. you want the surprise or not?
speaker3: good afternoon, madam. hello there, little girl.
speaker1: hey, hey, what are you doing!?

speaker1: just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. only cost you a dollar. 
speaker2: i don't want my windshield cleaned.
speaker1: you just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
speaker2: no, i know i don't want it cleaned. get out of here.
speaker1: don't be like that. think of me as the moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
speaker2: for the last time, i don't want it cleaned. now get the out of here!
speaker1: it's already done. i've already done it. you have to pay me now.
speaker2: i don't have to pay you nothin'.
speaker1: you're going to deny me a lousy dollar after i've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
speaker2: a.
speaker1: i don't think so.

speaker1: hey! 
speaker2: i think this is worth a dollar.
speaker1: goddamnit! gimme that!
speaker2: oh, we'll have to do better than that.

speaker1: i...1 would like to...thank you, mister wat... gene.

speaker1: i would also like to apologize.
