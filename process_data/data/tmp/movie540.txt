speaker2: oh.

speaker1: it's a beautiful day and the sun is shining and yellow. and the world is too big to understand and today is tuesday and -- 
speaker2: no, it's friday, honey.
speaker1: and today is friday and...
speaker2: so what exactly did he say?
speaker3: my pupils weren't properly dilating and, um, not doing the opposite ...
speaker2: constricting.
speaker4: no. yes. the bump to the head?
speaker3: he doesn't know. maybe. he said he doesn't think so. but maybe.

speaker1: did you have to get a shot, daddy? 
speaker2: no, honey. it's the start of something awful.

speaker1: like to smoke out of?
speaker2: different kind of pipe. just run lines. i'll be there soon. 'kay. houses have pipes. they're, like, tubes and they're behind walls and under the floor everywhere and -- olive begins to whimper in horror.
speaker3: what's wrong, baby?
speaker1: every-single-where?
speaker2: it's okay. they just carry water to and from sinks and bathtubs and toilets. it's like in your body you have veins and ... um...
speaker3: capillaries.
speaker2: and they're filled with blood.
speaker1: i don't want blood. i have blood?

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: i'm trying to explain plumbing.
speaker1: well, stop it. it's okay, honey.
speaker3: i don't want blood. will it hurt?
speaker2: no, honey, you're fine.
speaker4: i don't want blood! i don't want blood! i don't wanti can't do this now. blood...
speaker1: you don't have to worry, baby. you don't have blood.
speaker2: well, i don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood.
speaker1: caden, stop it!

speaker1: thanks for getting me in right away. 
speaker1: is it the bump to the head?

speaker1: no. could be. but i think we need to get you to a neurologist. nothing urgent. 
speaker2: a neurologist?
speaker1: yes, a brain expert.

speaker1: i thought maybe you said urologist. 
speaker2: for a look-see. the eyes are part of the brain, after all.
speaker1: that's not true, is it?
speaker2: why would i say it if it weren't true?
speaker1: it just doesn't seem right.
speaker2: like morally correct? or right as in accurate?
speaker1: i'm not sure. accurate, i guess.
speaker2: hmm. interesting.

speaker1: willy, you coming up!!!! 
speaker2: sssssh!!
speaker1: willy?
speaker1: willy? answer me!...willy!
speaker1: no!!!
speaker3: pop!!

speaker1: please. that was good, tom. 
speaker2: yeah? i was trying something different. i was crashing differently. ambivalently.
speaker1: i saw that. i like it.
speaker1: try to keep in mind that a young person playing loman thinks he's only pretending to be at the end of a life full of despair. but the tragedy is that we know that you, the young actor, will end up in this very place of desolation.
speaker2: okay.

speaker1: great. let's try it again. 
speaker1: how long, david?
speaker2: i think fifteen.
speaker1: why don't you get cleaned up, tom, and we'll go again.

speaker1: i just heard the death of the salesman. 
speaker2: in more ways than one.
speaker1: oh no.

speaker1: signal's good here, oddly. 
speaker2: that is odd.
speaker1: i know! cell phones, they're crazy!
speaker3: see you in a few. yup.

speaker1: i keep reading the first line. it's a good line, i think. but i don't know much about literature. 
speaker2: maybe you should read the first line of another series of books.
speaker1: i'm trying to better myself, caden. recommend me something. you're a genius; you must've read nearly a dozen books.
speaker2: exactly twelve. have you read kafka?

speaker1: his whole name? 
speaker2: okay, not his entire name. heinz?
speaker1: you should read the trial, maybe.
speaker2: if you say so, i will. can't wait till wednesday. i'm so excited to see it.
speaker1: i hope you like it.
speaker2: it's pretty impossible that i won't, you know. i mean...

speaker1: i think i have blood in my stool. 
speaker2: that stool in your office?

speaker1: when i was pregnant with olive... 
speaker2: what was it like?

speaker1: um... i don't know. hopeful or something. like something was going to change. 
speaker2: something did, no?
speaker3: yes, of course. yes. i mean... big time.
speaker1: maybe not as much as i had hoped.
speaker2: there are no terrible things to say in here. only true and false.
speaker1: i feel alone sometimes. i feel exhausted. can i say something awful?
speaker2: yes. please do.
speaker1: i've fantasized about caden dying and being able to start again.

speaker1: it's a nightmare in there. 
speaker2: the car crash?
speaker1: well... not only.
speaker2: sorry. so i'm reading the trial.
speaker1: yeah? you like?

speaker1: love. i'm such an for not knowing about this book. it's famous, it turns out. 
speaker2: you're not an
speaker1: then you say, in fact, you're very bright, hazel. and i love your eyes.
speaker3: in fact, you're very bright,
speaker2: then what do i say?
speaker1: i can't say what then you say.
speaker2: why?
speaker1: cause it's dirty.
speaker1: oh my
speaker1: he's gotta be dead. right?

speaker1: can i in your sink? 
speaker2: um, yeah, i guess.
speaker1: it's gorgeous, ad.
speaker2: thanks. how was rehearsal?
speaker1: awful. we have five hundred and sixty lighting cues. i don't know why i made it so complicated.
speaker2: it's what you do.
speaker1: yeah. anyway, we got through it.
speaker2: caden, listen, i'm really sorry. i just can't go tonight. i'm sorry. i've got to get two canvases ready to ship. by tomorrow. i know it

speaker1: oh boy, oh boy. 
speaker2: willy!
speaker1: it's all right, i came back.
speaker2: why? what happened?
speaker2: did something happen, willy?
speaker1: no, nothing happened.
speaker2: you didn't smash the car, did you?
speaker1: i said nothing happened. didn't you hear me?
speaker2: don't you feel well?
speaker1: i'm tired to death. i couldn't make it. i just couldn't make it, linda.
speaker2: where were you all day? you look terrible.
speaker1: i got as far as a little above yonkers. i stopped for a cup of coffee... maybe it was the coffee.

speaker1: what? 
speaker2: i suddenly couldn't drive any more. the car kept going off onto the shoulder, y'know?

speaker1: yeah. absolutely. sorry. i have a bit of a headache. 
speaker2: i just want to thank you for everything. you've been absolutely brilliant and it's going to be miserable going ahead without you.
speaker1: i'll be around. i'll check in.
speaker2: i'm such a baby.
speaker2: i'm going to get drunk, that's what.
speaker1: ok, claire.
speaker3: i figured i'd better get in fast.
speaker1: hey!
speaker3: i loved it! and, by the way, claire is trouble. and not terribly bright.
speaker3: just wanted you to know the word on the street.

speaker1: so you liked it? 
speaker2: are you kidding? i cried for like fifteen minutes after. i loved every minute of it. except claire.
speaker1: easy on the eyes.
speaker2: oh, caden, not you, too. what i want to know is why she started crying in her last monologue, right after she had the line, 'i can't cry for you willy...'?
speaker1: she felt very strongly that it was right.
speaker2: where's el wife-o?
speaker1: had to work. her berlin show is in two weeks. we're going to spend like a month there.
speaker2: ah.
speaker1: ah.
speaker2: ah.
speaker1: choo!
speaker2: hooray! we've still got it!
speaker2: i'll miss you.
speaker1: yeah, me too.

speaker1: you're going to miss you? yeah, that's it. 
speaker2: why do i like you so much?

speaker1: i couldn't begin to guess. 
speaker2: me neither. it must be that you're married. do you get high, my friend?
speaker1: y'know. sometimes.
speaker2: you want to now? with me.
speaker3: i don't know.come on, it's a party.
speaker1: i get kind of... something when i'm stoned.
speaker2: what does something mean?
speaker3: i don't know. bothered?what does bothered mean?
speaker1: y'know... bothered. horny.
speaker2: and me with a station wagon and all. could be dangerous.
speaker1: yeah, it really could.
speaker2: you're absolutely zero fun.
speaker1: you know i wish i could.
speaker2: i like you. i'm going.
speaker1: you're not staying for the reviews?

speaker1: what are you going to do now? 
speaker2: i'm going to berlin for a month for my wife's show. then i don't know.
speaker1: i wish i was your wife or a wife or had a wife. or was german even. i'm so lonely with none of those things.

speaker1: the sellers are very motivated now. 
speaker2: it's a scary decision. i never thought i'd buy a house alone. but, y'know, i'm 36, and i wonder what i'm really waiting for.

speaker1: i like it, i do. but i'm really concerned about dying in the fire. 
speaker2: it's a big decision, how one prefers to die. would you like to meet my son? derek?

speaker1: hey. hey. 
speaker2: hi, caden. how'd it go?
speaker3: hi. it's late.
speaker4: maria came over to keep me company and we lost track. i'm sorry i missed the play. but i got everything done here. how'd it go?

speaker5: great. that's great, caden! good for you!
speaker4: i'll see it tomorrow. tonight!

speaker1: yeah. love to know what you think. 
speaker2: it doesn't matter what i think.
speaker3: absolutely! it's all about your artistic satisfaction, caden.

speaker1: what's wrong with your face, daddy? 
speaker2: it's pustules. it's called sycosis. spelled differently than psychosis, but it sounds the same.
speaker1: i don't know what that means.
speaker2: well, there's two different kinds of psychosis. they're spelled differently. p-s-y is like if you're crazy and s-y is like these things on my face.
speaker1: you could have both though.
speaker2: i could. but i don't.
speaker1: okay, pretend we're fairies. i'm a girl fairy and my name is ... la-ru...lee. and you're a boy fairy and your name is teeteree.
speaker2: ok.
speaker1: what's my name again?
speaker2: la-ru-lee.

speaker1: pretend we fight each other. and i say stop hitting me or i'll die. and you say okay, but you're fibbing. and you hit me again. 
speaker2: okay.
speaker1: okay. let's go. hit me.
speaker1: okay. you have to stop hitting me now or i will die.
speaker2: okay.
speaker1: no! pretend you're fibbing! remember?
speaker1: now i have to die.
speaker1: pretend you say you don't want me to die.
speaker2: i don't want you to die.
speaker1: but i have to.
speaker2: but i'll miss you.

speaker1: i have to. and you'll have to wait a million years to see me again. 
speaker1: and i'll be put in a box. and all i'll need is a tiny glass of water. and lots of -- tiny pieces of pizza. and the box will have wings, like an airplane.
speaker2: where will it take you?
speaker1: home.

speaker1: let's go, mom. 
speaker2: i'll be with you in a minute. go on, charley. i want to, just a minute.
speaker2: i never had a chance to say good- bye. forgive me, dear. i can't cry. i don't understand it; i can't cry. it seems to me that you're just on another trip. i keep expecting you. willy, dear, why did you do it? i search and search and i search, and i can 't understand it, willy. i made the last payment on the house today. today, dear. and there'll be nobody home. we're free and clearãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã‚â¦

speaker1: i just --i don't know what it matters what i think. 
speaker2: i loved the story. so interesting.
speaker1: because your opinion is --it was good. it was well done. it was very ... successful.
speaker3: oh, i thought it was wonnnderful!
speaker4: why were the old people so young?

speaker1: is that your entire frame of reference for relationship problems? 
speaker2: no. i don't know. it's a stressful time. our shows. the whole health thing.
speaker1: oh, you're fine.

speaker1: when you are dead there is no time. the world is a timeless rock.

speaker1: mr. cotard? 
speaker2: mr. cotard?

speaker1: it's serious? 
speaker2: we don't know but yes.
speaker2: we'll get you enrolled a biofeedback program. maybe you can learn some sort of manual override.

speaker1: be quiet, squishy.hi. 
speaker2: caden, i won't be yet another woman you feel guilty about.

speaker1: okay. thank you anyway. 
speaker2: here. take this. i got like five for christmas. christmas.

speaker1: that's wonderful. bless! i guess you'll have to discover your real self. right? 
speaker2: yeah, i mean, yeah. oh, i wanted to ask you, how old are kids when they start to write?
speaker1: varies.
speaker2: could a four year old keep a diary?
speaker1: listen, there's an absolutely brilliant novel written by a four year old.
speaker3: really?little winky. by horace azpiazu.
speaker2: aww. cute.
speaker1: hardly. little winky is a virulent anti-semite.

speaker1: the story follows his initiation into the klan, his immersion in the pornographic snuff industry and his ultimate degradation at the hands of a black ex-convict named eric washington jackson jones... johnson... jefferson, with whom he embarks on a brutal homosexual affair. 
speaker2: wow. written by a four year old?

speaker1: azpiazu killed himself at five. 
speaker2: that's horrible.
speaker1: he would've written so much more had he lived. they developed a method -- some software -- to determine what he would've written had he lived to ten, twenty, thirty, etcetera.
speaker2: is that possible?
speaker1: which part?
speaker2: any of it. why did he kill himself?
speaker1: i don't know, why did you?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: i said, why would you?
speaker2: oh. i don't know.

speaker1: deer diry. thank you for being my new best frend. my name is olive cotard. i am for yers old. i like choclit and -- 
speaker1: -- my favorite color is pink.

speaker1: can i help you? 
speaker2: i'm looking for a christmas present for my daughter. something pink.
speaker1: how about this?
speaker2: yes. that's good.

speaker1: the idea is to do a massive theater piece. uncompromising, honest. i don't know what it is yet or how to do it, but it'll come. it'll reveal itself. 
speaker2: huh.
speaker1: hereãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s what i think theater is: itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s the beginning of thought. the truth not yet spoken. itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s a blackbird in winter. the moment before death. itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s what a man feels after heãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s been clocked in the jaw. itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s love... in all its messiness. and i want all of us, players and audience alike, to soak in the communal bath of it, the mikvah, as the jews call it. weãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢re all in the same water, after all, soaking in our very menstrual blood and nocturnal emissions. this is what i want to try to give people, hazel. and i want your help.

speaker1: what are you doing? 
speaker2: salivating.
speaker2: i have to concentrate.
speaker2: biofeedback training.
speaker1: huh.
speaker2: so i was wondering if you'll help.
speaker1: in your box office?
speaker2: no. like as my assistant.
speaker1: i'm not sure i can work with you, caden. i'm kind of angry.
speaker2: i just want to normalize it, hazel. i think we'd have fun together.
speaker2: i miss you.
speaker2: i'm digesting.
speaker1: it's really disturbing.

speaker1: i've been thinking a lot about dying lately. 
speaker2: you're going to be fine, sweetie.
speaker1: i appreciate that, claire, but --
speaker3: well, you are. you poor regardless of how this thing.particular thing works itself out, i will be dying. so will you.
speaker3: caden!so will everyone here. and i want to explore that unflinchingly.
speaker1: we are all hurtling toward death.
speaker1: yet here we are, for the moment, alive. each of us knowing we will die; each of us secretly believing we won't.
speaker2: it's brilliant. it's brilliant.
speaker4: dear diary. germany is wonderful! so many friends here. my new dads are great and handsome. and brilliant directors of theater.
speaker5: it's hazel. leave a message or don't. your dime.

speaker2: i don't know what i'm doing.
speaker3: but that's what's so ... cryptology... refreshing. i mean, how much prepackaged ...
speaker1: ... theater can we take as a country? y'know? knowing that you don't know is the first and most essential step to knowing. y'know?
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker3: i'm proud of you.ptolemy was the first to divide the day into 24...
speaker1: so tell me what you want from me?
speaker2: hmm?
speaker1: from my character.

speaker1: oh. well, we'll build it over time together. find a real person, maybe, to model it after. 
speaker2: that sounds fun. ...hairstyle called a beaver tail. it's a loop of hair...
speaker3: that hazel girl is kind of interesting, maybe. as a model.
speaker1: um, yeah. something to think about. sure. although --

speaker1: no. i have these health issues. 
speaker2: it's late. ... and the jet, it exploded, and she was sent plummeting.
speaker3: um...well, we can talk more tomorrow maybe.
speaker1: i'm sorry.
speaker1: when i get tired i have to remember to breathe. it's a new thing. my autonomic functions are failing.
speaker4: poor darling. it's fine.

speaker1: i'm just ... shh. shh. shh. shh. shh. 
speaker2: whitrow says, "if a mind is regarded to be a memory-based process of integration..."

speaker1: my mother died last night. 
speaker2: my i'm so sorry. what are you doing out?
speaker1: ugh, i couldn't deal with my sisters. it's like living in a heironymous bosch painting.
speaker2: oh. i see. well, um, what happened to your mother, if i could ask? i mean, that's an awful thing to ask. i'm sorry. i don't mean to -- it's just that, i'm --
speaker1: oh, this is me. no, it's okay. she fell. slipped in her bathroom. hit her head. it actually split in half. horrible.
speaker2: in half?
speaker1: yes. well, it was nice meeting you. did i say "meeting"? ugh, i'm such an

speaker1: slip of the tongue is all.freudian slip. 
speaker2: i don't know how it's freudian.
speaker3: y'know. like "meet"? to meet?
speaker2: oh. well, i'm sorry about your mother. in half?
speaker3: it's okay. it's life. it's --
speaker2: what is it? what?
speaker2: do you want me to drive you home?
speaker3: sometimes when i cry, i watch myself so i can remember how it looks for future roles. it's horrible. i hate myself.
speaker2: it's okay. everyone does that.

speaker1: i'm so sorry. 
speaker2: i was a baby girl with hair of spun gold, the prettiest baby anyone had ever seen. one day the townsfolk, who were jealous of my beauty, decided to steal me away.

speaker1: there was a knock at thegod, you're beautiful. door. 
speaker2: it was a bearded old man.
speaker2: he said to me, "young lady, i have in my satchel a ring. whomever possesses it will receive all the magic of the woodland sprites."
speaker2: he said, "there is one more thing. you must never tell anyone what you promised me. if you do, you will die."

speaker1: so i used my new power to kill all the townsfolk. horrible, humiliating deaths. i was reunited with my family. and i lived happily ever after, doing only good with my new powers. caden cries and rests his head on her thigh. 
speaker1: why are you crying, honey?
speaker2: i'm so in love with you.
speaker2: i have problems, claire. i'm still attached to my wife. i have also -- i have also -- feelings for hazel.
speaker1: really? hazel? oh. really? our hazel? that's really interesting. i must've picked that up unconsciously. wow. boy. gosh.
speaker2: i've left them behind. i've gone somewhere without them. i'm guilty of so much.
speaker1: it's okay. we'll be fine. you're with me now. we'll be good.

speaker1: she's 36. works in a theater box office. she had acting aspirations but lacked the confidence to pursue them. her life is passing by. she is alone. she's old and ugly -- 
speaker2: i think you should pick another subject. other than hazel.
speaker1: sacred ground?
speaker2: no. it's just. i don't feel like there's enough there.
speaker1: i suppose not. she is limited. okay. there's this single mother who lives downstairs. i find her really deep and sad.
speaker2: tell me.
speaker1: i'm 42. i have a small child and no husband. i work long hours as a cashier at a mini-mart. sometimes i worry my child will not even recognize me when i come home --

speaker2: they said he suffered horribly. that he called out for me right before he died. they said he said he regretted his life. they said he said a lot of things. too many to recount. they said it was the longest and saddest deathbed speech any of them had ever heard.

speaker2: i've learned everything about you by following you. hire me and you will see who you truly are.
speaker2: peek-a-boo.

speaker1: a mythical beast with and eternally fused, two pair of eyes that look only at each other, lips ever touching and one voice that whispers to itself. 
speaker2: yes, okay. you've got the part.
speaker3: he's good, caden.
speaker2: please don't fall in love with him.
speaker3: i only have eyes for you, dear.

speaker2: good boy.

speaker1: when is it opening? 
speaker2: when it's ready.
speaker1: we need to get in. it's bad out here.
speaker2: i was thinking of calling it simulacrum. what do you think?
speaker3: i don't know what it means.
speaker4: can me have a nickel if i doesn't play with my pee-pee no more?

speaker1: how about the flawed light of love and grief? 
speaker2: i'm not sure.

speaker1: i'm going to work in my journal. 
speaker2: no, thanks.no, thanks, claire.
speaker3: claire? i want you to drop your study of mrs. kranstein.
speaker4: caden -- i want you to play yourself. sammy's going to move into your apartment set as me.

speaker1: it'd be my honor to play your husband, claire. you're an amazing actress. i saw you in bernarda alba last year at the roundabout. 
speaker2: yeah? that was a fun play. emotionally tough, but fulfilling.

speaker1: and i loved working with so many strong female actresses. ugh, lorca's a genius. okay. i'm going to start thinking about myself. 
speaker2: start, huh?
speaker2: why did we leave adele, caden?
speaker3: she left us. you know that better than anyone. except me.
speaker2: amazing artist though. the best living artist. there's no one who stares the truth in the face like she does. a sweet pussy, too.
speaker3: how do you know that?
speaker2: oh. i read it.
speaker3: anyway, i don't know where she is. a strange dirigible flies very low overhead.
speaker2: maybe she's got a sublet in new york. maybe the met's doing a retrospective. maybe, baby.
speaker3: why are you giving this to me?
speaker2: i want to follow you there and see how you lose even more of yourself.

speaker1: i asked you to hold the door. 
speaker2: i'm sorry. i pressed it, butyou didn't press it. i think it was too late.
speaker3: have a good night.

speaker1: frances, i need to go to the clinic. something's terribly wrong with my nose. 
speaker2: oh yes. i see.
speaker2: are you ellen? ellen?!
speaker3: what?
speaker2: are you ellen bascomb? i'm to give the key to 31y to ellen bascomb.
speaker3: yes, i'm ellen.
speaker2: she said you should just go in and get started. she said, don't forget to change the sheets.
speaker3: ok. thank you.
speaker2: oh dear.

speaker1: i went for a walk. i had to think. 
speaker2: all night? you smell weird. are you wearing lipstick?
speaker1: no! what do i smell like? like bad? like an old person?
speaker2: i don't know. like mold? i don't know. like mold and ... cleaning products? like you're menstruating? i don't know!

speaker1: i don't like that guy you got to play you. 
speaker2: you don't like sammy? why? i think he's good.
speaker1: i think you need to fire him.
speaker1: oh, you. i'm forty-five years old. i don't want to do this anymore.
speaker2: i'm not firing him, claire. he's the best thing in the show. next to you.
speaker1: he's coming on to me. he's feeling my during rehearsal.
speaker2: he's your husband.
speaker1: he's not my godamn husband! you are! what is wrong with you?

speaker1: good, jimmy! it's for the play. we're getting at something real here. 
speaker2: ugh! i'm going to rehearsal.
speaker3: that's great, you guys.
speaker3: beautiful, sammy.
speaker4: caden, time out?
speaker5: what's up? i feel we need a hazel in here. there's a whole side of caden i'm not able to explore without a hazel.
speaker3: i guess, yeah.
speaker6: i get to be a character? hooray!

speaker1: caden, what are you doing at night? 
speaker2: i've been going to adele's place. and cleaning it.
speaker1: do you know what i've given up for you? for this. for you. for you.

speaker1: i'm sorry.i -- i thought i wanted to be just a working stage actress. but, y'know, i'm watching all the young girls crowding me out and it's -- 
speaker2: get the door. please. just...
speaker3: uh-oh. this looks serious. am i interrupting?
speaker4: what's going on, hazel?
speaker3: just wanted to tell you the girl playing me is able to start today.
speaker1: oh, good. that's good.that's all we need around here, two hazels.
speaker3: okay. i'll take that as my cue.
speaker2: maybe you can clean her toilet.
speaker4: maybe i will.
speaker2: it's over, caden.
speaker4: claire, no.
speaker2: i'm not talking to you.

speaker1: i didn't say i was going to clean hazel's toilet. he did. 
speaker2: but you thought it.
speaker1: i thought it. but i didn't say it.
speaker2: i got an offer to do needleman in a haystack and i'm going to take it. i want you out of the apartment. the real one. you can keep this one.
speaker1: claire! please!
speaker3: already put out a call for a claire replacement. would you really clean my bathroom?
speaker1: yeah.
speaker3: caden, it's all so

speaker1: oh, needleman, you had such potential. but iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m afraid iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m going to have to move on. 
speaker2: just like that? you donãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢t give a guy even a chance?
speaker1: iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m not a chance-giving girl. iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m a fun-loving girl. remember?
speaker2: i try to be fun-loving. see?
speaker1: my analyst says you have complexes.
speaker2: once you enjoyed needlemanãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s complexes.
speaker1: thatãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s before my analyst taught me that my enjoyment of them was a sign of my suppressed non- enjoymnent of them.
speaker2: i hate your analyst.

speaker1: she told me your hatred of her is a sign of your latent homosexuality. 
speaker2: this is the end of my stuff.
speaker3: bye.bye.

speaker1: morning, haze. 
speaker2: hi, caden. how was your night?
speaker1: okay. yours?
speaker2: eh. philip was colicky. i was up all night.
speaker3: sorry.
speaker1: sorry. everybody here?
speaker2: sammy's not here. jimmy called and said there's some subway problem.

speaker1: sorry. sorry, sorry, sorry. 
speaker1: hi, hazel.
speaker2: hi, sammy.
speaker3: sammy likes you.
speaker3: hazel, could you get everyone situated? i need to speak to will about some new sets.
speaker2: yeah. we'll take it from june 9th?
speaker4: oh, i need to do that, too.
speaker5: yup. june 9th?

speaker1: hazel, what do you think of this title: unknown, unkissed, and lost? 
speaker2: eh. caden this is millicent weems.
speaker1: hi, millicent. have a seat. how are you at cleaning?
speaker3: i'm very, very good at it.
speaker1: because this part requires a lot of it. you'd play a cleaning lady.
speaker3: i played egga the cleaning lady in hedda gabler at the roundabout.

speaker1: you're weirdly close to what i've visualized for this character. 
speaker2: glad to be weirdly close.

speaker1: where're sammy and hazel? 
speaker1: hey, sammy, what are you doing?
speaker2: hi, caden. i'm being you. you like hazel; i like hazel.
speaker1: this hazel doesn't exist for you. if you want to like a hazel, like that one.

speaker1: hazel. what? 
speaker2: you don't like him, do you?
speaker3: kind of. he reminds me of you.
speaker2: i'm me. you don't need someone to remind you of me.

speaker1: don't worry, caden. i like you more. i do. sammy's just fun. 
speaker2: i'm fun.
speaker1: oh, sweetie. no, you're not.
speaker3: yes?is this caden cotard?
speaker3: yes.this is officer mark mellman of schnectady p.d.
speaker3: yes?i'm sorry to inform you, your mother has been the victim of a home invasion.

speaker1: was my father standing with us? 
speaker2: i don't know what he looks like.
speaker1: he's dead. he looks dead, i guess.
speaker2: probably wasn't him then.
speaker1: a little moustache?
speaker3: anyway, thanks for coming with me.

speaker1: it's okay. 
speaker2: i asked hazel but she was busy tonight and you're the next best thing. i mean, it isn't that you're the next best thing but because you play her, it feels comforting. does that make sense? although the thing is offstage you're nothing like her. you play her very well though. did hazel mention what she was doing tonight because i called her house before we left and her husband said she wasn't going to be back till late and i thought that was weird because she told me philip was sick.
speaker1: she's going to dinner with sammy.
speaker2: that's interesting.

speaker1: don't forget your phone. 
speaker2: thank you, yammy.
speaker2: hey. what you up to?

speaker1: in my car. heading to dinner with sammy. 
speaker2: why didn't you tell me that before?
speaker3: caden. i don't want to say things that are going to make you sad.
speaker2: it mostly makes me sad that it doesn't make you sad.
speaker3: you want me to be sad that someone's taking me out to dinner?
speaker2: i want you to be sad that we had something really special and it's going away!
speaker3: it just happened, caden. i didn't plan it. you were with claire. this probably isn't going to go anywhere, sweetie. i'm still your girl.

speaker1: he has stories about me! 
speaker2: caden, i know everything about you and it's all adorable. i love you and i always will. so don't worry. i gotta go, i'm there.

speaker1: did you always want to be an actress? 
speaker2: every girl wants to be an actress.
speaker1: is that true?
speaker2: i did. so i figure everyone does.

speaker1: i thought someone would've cleaned it up. 
speaker2: who?
speaker1: i don't know! someone.
speaker1: this is my room. you can sleep here.
speaker2: where will you sleep?
speaker1: the living room couch.
speaker2: don't you want to sleep with me?

speaker1: um... it's just sex. 
speaker2: okay. if you think it's okay.
speaker2: how can you be like that?
speaker3: i get undressed every day.
speaker2: in front of someone is different.
speaker3: i don't see why.
speaker2: maybe because you have a beautiful body. maybe that makes it easier.
speaker3: i suppose it might. do you want to
speaker2: i do. yes. um. do you?
speaker3: it'd be fine.
speaker2: i'm sorry. i'm very lonely. i don't know what's wrong. i just -- i'm sorry. can you understand? do you understand loneliness?
speaker3: yeah, i mean, i don't know. i feel okay mostly. might help.
speaker2: i'm sorry.
speaker3: it's okay. i don't mind. take your clothes off.

speaker1: thanks. 
speaker2: sometimes i wish i were pretty like that.
speaker1: you wish you were a chick?
speaker2: sometimes i think i might've been better at it.
speaker1: interesting. it's kind of a drag in a lot of ways. you like guys?
speaker2: no. no. i like women. i only like women.
speaker1: well, i'm getting cold.
speaker1: take off your clothes.
speaker1: pretty caden.
speaker2: thanks. thank you for saying that.
speaker1: come to bed, pretty caden.

speaker2: that's hazel's house.
speaker1: huh. do you think we should have a hazel's house on the set for me?
speaker2: um...
speaker1: it would be verisimilitudinous.
speaker2: yeah. i don't know. i have to speak to the fire marshal.
speaker1: it would be very verisimilitudinous if you could.

speaker1: hank! okay! 
speaker2: my house!
speaker3: is there no end to your kissing?
speaker1: it's verisimilitudinous. i'm thinking of that as a title.
speaker3: whatever. i've got work to do. tell your girlfriend to get out here if she wants a ride back.
speaker1: she's not my girlfriend.
speaker3: give it a rest, caden. i can smell her on your breath.
speaker1: tammy! we have to get back.

speaker1: jeremy is playing to us. tell him he simply needs to talk to donna. we'll hear what we hear. 
speaker2: sammy's explaining too much. feels expository. needs to be shorthand, like, "jeremy big."
speaker3: caden? can we stop for a second?
speaker2: sure.
speaker3: if hazel's in love with sammy and caden's in love with hazel, there would be a dramatic confrontation, where caden turns to me and says, "it's obvious he's a substitute for me." i think then hazel could have a good moment where she cries or gets angry. i'm not sure which yet, but it feels dramatically sound.
speaker4: that didn't happen, caden.
speaker3: i think hazel would do that, hazel.
speaker4: but hazel hasn't done it, tammy.

speaker1: caden? what do you think?i think we could try it. 
speaker2: great!fuck. i'm going out for a smoke.
speaker3: let's try it. maybe it could happen at the director's table.

speaker1: tammy was right. i don't understand why you're with sammy. 
speaker2: he's nice. he's available. he me without crying.
speaker1: that happened one time! you him?
speaker2: yes! and you and i only one time that's why you only cried one time! i give you endless opportunities.
speaker1: what do you mean, he's available?
speaker2: derek left. because of you!
speaker1: when? how come you never told me?
speaker2: i don't know, caden. how come a lot of things? it's not like we can start fresh, like sammy and i can. there's all this pressure on us. we're finally both free and there's all this pressure.

speaker1: that's such a romantic response. 
speaker2: it's not my response. it just crossed my mind. we have enormous budgetary concerns here.
speaker1: ugh. forget it. derek is played by joe --

speaker1: she looks like you. and -- 
speaker2: no she does not. -- and she offered to have with me. abernathy?
speaker3: yes. was it good?
speaker1: i don't know. yeah. it was nice.
speaker2: ugh. i'm just trying to be honest. it was nice. not earth- shattering.
speaker3: did you cry?
speaker1: no!
speaker3: you're making progress.
speaker1: okay, i cried a little before. hazel, you've been part of me forever. don't you know that? i breathe your name in every exhalation.

speaker1: oh, caden. oh, what the are we doing? 
speaker2: i don't know.
speaker2: crap, ellen's october 23rd scene!

speaker1: what's going on, maurice? 
speaker2: sorry. we have a couple of new guys on and we're not in sync yet.
speaker1: okay. are we good to go?
speaker2: yup.

speaker1: are you ellen? ellen?! 
speaker2: line, please.
speaker3: ãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã…â“what?ãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã‚â
speaker2: right. what?
speaker1: are you ellen bascomb? i'm to give the key to 31y to ellen bascomb.
speaker2: yes, i'm ellen.
speaker1: she said you should just go in and get started. she said, don't forget to change the sheets.
speaker2: ok. thank you.
speaker1: oh dear.
speaker2: wrong key.
speaker1: what?

speaker1: itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s the wrong key. it doesnãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢t turn. 
speaker2: itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s the one they gave me.
speaker3: iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m jumping in the shower. make some coffee, would ya?
speaker4: did you hear that?
speaker5: what?did we hire an adele?
speaker6: iãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢m sure i wouldãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢ve remembered that. no.
speaker1: caden, youãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢re breaking the fourth wall. i get to open the door.
speaker4: this is the wrong key, sandy.
speaker2: it isnãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢t.
speaker4: adele! adele, are you in there?
speaker7: maybe itãƒâ¢ã¢â‚â¬ã¢â„â¢s the wrong key.
speaker4: adele?
speaker6: caden, there's no one in there. you've got to let go of her. she's not here anymore. i'm here.

speaker1: yeah, okay. can we just get the right key, so we can do the scene? 
speaker2: yeah, we'll get the right key.

speaker1: look familiar? 
speaker2: oh my it's an exact replica of the tethered maiden terrace! derek and the kids and i had so much fun on that trip!
speaker1: listen, i built this because i wanted to show you what happened --
speaker3: after me, caden, there's no one left to watch you.
speaker4: there's nothing to talk
speaker4: coming up!
speaker1: no fair, sammy! she wouldn't see you jump. she never saw me! you're not being authentic.
speaker3: this is where we part ways. this is authentic. this is what the real caden would do. this is what real love looks like.

speaker1: do you see what i'm saying? 
speaker2: come over tonight? please?

speaker1: we could get a place together. we could get a loft. 
speaker2: caden, that sounds nice. i miss my daughter. maybe she could come live with us.
speaker1: yeah. i miss olive. and the other one. the retarded one.
speaker2: i'm a bad person.

speaker1: you can't cause someone to kill himself. he was troubled. 
speaker2: i'm so ashamed of myself.
speaker2: oh, caden. i wish we had this when we were young. and all the years in between. so many years, so fast.
speaker2: what did we do?
speaker1: my heart aches so much for you.
speaker2: we're here, caden. i'm here.
speaker1: i'm aching for it being over.
speaker2: yeah. the end is built in to the beginning. what can you do?
speaker1: you're just perfect.
speaker2: i'm a mess. but we fit, don't we.
speaker1: it doesn't always happen for me now. because of the medication and everything. i take a lot of pills.
speaker2: i don't care. it's okay.

speaker1: i'm sorry. 
speaker2: it's okay. it's different crying this time. i can tell. i'm crying, too. and i cried last time. after you left. i never told you. but i cried, too.
speaker1: i have a title. the obscure moon lighting an obscure world.
speaker2: i think it might be too much.

speaker1: olive wants to see you. knows why; the way you abandoned her. 
speaker2: oh, shut up.she's had a fucked-up life with issues, thanks to you.
speaker2: you're insane.she's dying, is that insane enough for you?
speaker1: anyway, she wants to say goodbye to you. knows the why.

speaker1: hello, darling. hi. 
speaker2: this is him.
speaker3: hello.hi, olive. i've missed you so much.
speaker4: maria, would you leave us?
speaker2: in heaven, my darling.
speaker4: forgive me but no longer remember english. speak german?

speaker1: no. i'm sorry.i had hope you have learned. 
speaker2: i'm dying, as i'm sure maria told you. the flower tattoos have become infected and they're dying. so i am, as well. this is life.
speaker3: it's maria. she did this.
speaker2: maria gave me reason to live once you left. the flowers defined me.
speaker3: your mother and maria took you away. i tried for years to find you. i didn't leave you.
speaker2: you did something.
speaker2: i want to talk to you about your homosexuality.
speaker3: what? i'm not a homosexual!
speaker2: maria said you would deny it.
speaker3: she's lying to you.
speaker2: i had the same struggle when i first fell in love with maria and we began to have dirty, aching sex.

speaker1: maria is your lover? 
speaker2: of course. she introduced me to myself. to my and to hers.
speaker1: you have no idea how evil she is.
speaker2: i need to forgive you before i die, but i can't forgive someone who has not asked for forgiveness.

speaker1: i have no time! i need you to ask for forgiveness! 
speaker2: can you ever forgive me?
speaker1: for what?
speaker2: for abandoning you.
speaker1: "for abandoning you to have with my homosexual lover eric."
speaker2: for abandoning you to be have with my homosexual lover eric.
speaker1: no. no, i'm sorry, i cannot.
speaker3: i hope you're happy, faggot.

speaker1: it's hazel. leave a message or don't. your dime. 
speaker2: my love. i know how to do the play. it'll take place over the course of one day. the day will be the day before you died, the happiest day of my life. i'll be able to relive it forever.

speaker1: i need a caden for my hazel. 
speaker2: i... i'd very much like to play caden.
speaker1: um...

speaker1: i know it would be non-traditional casting, but i think i'm right for it. i think i understand caden. 
speaker2: i don't understand him.
speaker1: caden cotard is a man already dead, living in a half-world between stasis and antistasis. time is concentrated and chronology confused for him. up until recently he has strived valiantly to make sense of his situation, but now he has turned to stone.
speaker2: okay. that sounds good.
speaker3: she's right? i didn't see that at all. i saw it all as more hopeful.

speaker1: any thoughts for today's rehearsal? 
speaker2: i have a new title, maybe.
speaker1: huh.
speaker2: the title is about a lot of things.
speaker2: are you gay, michael?
speaker1: yes. i don't see what that has to do with anything.
speaker2: do you know someone named eric?

speaker1: come over tonight? please? 
speaker2: i'd like that.
speaker3: ok, take off the sweater.
speaker1: i'm hot.
speaker2: yes, you are.
speaker3: smile shyly at each other.
speaker2: this is tedious. this is nothing.
speaker4: what's she doing?
speaker1: he's directing.

speaker1: she's not getting the feel of you, caden. you don't move around. you don't talk to people. it's not -- 
speaker2: okay, folks, let's run it!
speaker3: everything is more complicated than you think. you only see a tenth of what is true. there are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. but maybe you won't know for twenty years. and you'll never ever trace it to its source. and you only get one chance to play it out. just try and figure out your own divorce. and they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. but while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. and it never comes or it seems to but doesn't really. and so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope for something good to come along. something to make you feel connected, to make you feel whole, to make you feel loved.

speaker1: millicent. 
speaker1: that was ... spectacular.
speaker2: it really was! delightful!
speaker3: thanks.i'm out of ideas. i'm dead.
speaker4: oh. i... could take over... as you... for a bit. until you feel refreshed.
speaker2: yes! yes!

speaker1: i need to keep my hand in. 
speaker2: well, ellen needs to be filled.
speaker1: filled? you mean...?

speaker1: i do like to clean. 
speaker2: ellen, olive has died. it's a time of overwhelming grief so please forgive my mess; i haven't been able to get out of bed. until today. much affection, a.

speaker1: ellen? is your name ellen? 
speaker2: yes?
speaker1: caden asked me to give you this.

speaker1: ... touched by the sadness of adele's neighbor. so close to death. reminds me of granny. i should really call her. remember how granny bascomb bounced me on her knee pretending to be a horsie. i loved that so much. say thank you to adele's neighbor. 
speaker2: thank you.
speaker3: you're very welcome, young lady.
speaker1: now say, have a very good day.
speaker2: have a very good day.
speaker3: i will indeed.

speaker1: i'm making eggs. 
speaker1: is everything okay, eric?
speaker2: everything's everything.

speaker1: ellen, why do you look so serious? 
speaker2: i'm going to remember this moment for the rest of my life, mama. and in exactly twenty years, come here with my daughter and have exactly the same picnic.
speaker1: baby, that's the loveliest thing i've ever heard.

speaker1: i can't believe she said that to him! she's a slut, anyway. 
speaker1: maybe i can ask adele for a raise. it's been three years. i do a good job. i'm so tired tonight.

speaker1: adele died of lung cancer last night. you may stay on if you like. 
speaker2: look shocked. weep.
speaker2: go into the kitchen and --

speaker1: hello. 
speaker1: where is everybody?
speaker2: mostly dead. some have left.
speaker1: would you sit with me for a moment? i'm very tired. and lonely.
speaker1: i feel like i know you.
speaker2: i was the mother in ellen's dream.
speaker1: yes! that's it. yes. you seem a bit older than i remember.
speaker2: that dream was quite a while ago.
speaker1: i didn't mean to say you look old.

speaker1: i know. 
speaker2: everyone's dreams in all those apartments. all those secrets we'll never know. that's the truth of it -- all the thoughts nobody will ever know.
speaker1: it's true.
speaker2: i'm sorry the experiment didn't work. i wanted it to with all my heart. i wanted to do that picnic with my daughter. i feel i've disappointed you terribly.
speaker1: no. no. i am so proud of you.
speaker2: all i want is someone to see me, someone to look at me with kindness. for me to be the most special person in the world to just one person.
speaker1: i know, baby. i know.
speaker1: you're going to be fine.
speaker2: i know what to do with this play now. i have an idea. i think -- the screen goes black fast.
