speaker3: you're divorced... too bad, she was actually interesting.

speaker3: so you're all alone in the house of pain.

speaker3: that's not why i'm here, sky, i just wanted to see you... i even brought a gift, for a change.

speaker3: you can't still be mad about the hash brownies...
speaker3: happy birthday, bro.

speaker3: it's a bomb. open it!
speaker2: consumer recreation services. ok...

speaker2: i don't get it.
speaker3: just call 'em. ok look, it's simple, really. they entertain you.
speaker2: is this an service?
speaker3: no, it's nothing like that. they're a business, they're for real... they guarantee just one thing-- you won't be bored.

speaker3: "a delicate liquidation," you would do this...
speaker2: david--
speaker3: we can't get together once without you making me feel like that's important to you, isn't it?
speaker2: what are you talking about?
speaker3: forget about it, don't bother.
speaker2: are you still on medication...?
speaker1: you guys know what you want?
speaker3: go away.
speaker3: i just thought you'd like it. i did, it was a blast, best thing that ever happened to me. and for your information, i'm not on anything anymore, i'm not even seeing a shrink, i'm in a better place than i've ever been, i'm even
speaker3: whatever.

speaker1: right. well, thanks again for calling, elizabeth, take care. elizabeth you too, schuyler-- i mean that--

speaker1: --up next, the latest in sports. for all of us here at cnn, thank you for watching--

speaker1: can i help you? 
speaker2: is this consumer recreation services? i have an appointment, the name's van orton.
speaker1: hm... i don't seem to--
speaker2: schuyler van orton, i called last week.
speaker3: problem?
speaker1: this gentlemen says he has an appointment, but...
speaker3: van orton, huh? i'll take him. jim feingold, v. p. in charge of engineering and data analysis.
speaker3: sorry about the chaos, we're still in the process of moving... follow me, i've got an office around here someplace.

speaker1: i can't remember the last time i ate in a restaurant, all i do is work... 
speaker2: i know what you mean. look-- what is all this?
speaker1: application, mmpi and tat tests, financial statement... want some? tung hoy, best in chinatown... the tests serve a threefold purpose. first off, are you right for us? are we right for you? unfortunately, there's a limited number of slots--
speaker2: let's back up here--
speaker1: b, we need an idea of your abilities and limitations, what turns you on, and off. numero tres, our insurance company requires it. you're familiar with our service, aren't you?
speaker2: not at all. what
speaker2: a game.
speaker1: recharges the batteries, gets you off the treadmill, it's an experience. sort of a-- vacation for the guy who's been everywhere.
speaker2: this really doesn't sound like my sort of--
speaker2: what's so amusing?
speaker1: nothing. i know who you are. you're david van orton's brother, he got you in here.
speaker2: so.
speaker1: david was-- impressive, one of the better i've seen. but frankly, i can see you're not the type.
speaker2: the type.
speaker1: you know, a player.
speaker2: i'm not a player.
speaker1: i don't mean anything personal by it-- i know you're an important guy, powerful guy, you're used to being on top. it's just, this isn't for everyone. not everyone can handle it.
speaker2: what kind of fu-- game is this?
speaker1: the ultimate game. i wish i could tell you more, but it's different every time. thanks for coming in--
speaker2: i'm not an i see what you're doing. first the vague yet intriguing pitch, then i'm supposed to feel like my manhood's in question because i'm not up for, what, some motivational role-playing fantasy nonsense--
speaker1: interesting, you don't know the first thing about it but you've already decided what it is... listen, i don't wanna waste any more--
speaker2: please, jim, cut the hard-to-get i've got the afternoon free, i'll take your silly tests.
speaker1: ms. nelson, are you busy? we need someone to run mr. van orton.
speaker3: this way, sir...
speaker1: i'll catch up with you after the physical.

speaker1: david, you suck. 
speaker2: sorry to keep you waiting, a client's head exploded... you can get dressed, we're done.
speaker2: looks promising at this point. you test well, you're in decent shape for someone in your tax bracket... hm, some resistance to the psych questions, but we got the general idea... he heads out, beckons for schuyler to follow.

speaker1: we design the game around your schedule, you're free to give it as much or as little time as you wish. and of course, you can call it quits at any point. 
speaker2: this was actually a gift. did my brother pay in advance?
speaker1: you'd have to ask our billing department... the price varies. but our service comes with a guarantee. if you're not satisfied, there's no charge. and we've never had an unsatisfied customer...
speaker2: you mean dissatisfied.
speaker1: mm, that's right-- you're a left- brain word fetishist.
speaker2: i get that all the time.

speaker1: so i'm supposed to sign up for a game when i don't know the rules, i don't know the object, i don't know how much it costs... 
speaker2: it's a leap of faith. but at this stage, there's no commitment-- we just need to process your application. and if you qualify, you're in for the ride of your life. what have you got to lose?
speaker2: initials-- initials-- sign here.
speaker2: in blood. ---just kidding.
speaker2: very good, mr. van orton. please, keep the pen.
speaker1: when can i expect to hear--
speaker2: we'll be in touch.

speaker1: david, where the are you, we were supposed to meet at the club-- 
speaker2: oh, sorry sky, i spaced-- next tuesday?
speaker1: i'll be in seattle.
speaker2: buy you lunch soon as you get back, i swear...
speaker1: i checked out crs by the way--
speaker2: hey, great, you gonna go for it?
speaker1: haven't decided yet...

speaker1: --like wildfire, just opened an office in frisco here-- 
speaker2: i played my game in new york... what do you think john, will crs ever go public?
speaker1: not likely, would you?
speaker3: new members?
speaker4: i believe so.
speaker3: this round's on me.

speaker1: ...last time i played pebble, i swore i'd never pick up a club again... 
speaker2: great thing about golf, the way it takes you out of your life... speaking of games-- i take it you two are familiar with crs...?
speaker3: uh-oh. time to piss...
speaker1: why do you ask, schuyler?
speaker2: i couldn't help overhearing--
speaker1: we don't usually talk about it.
speaker2: i only bring it up because, well, i recently tested for it.
speaker1: did you? kudos.
speaker2: i just wasn't sure if they're for real, whether it's worth it--
speaker1: worth it... gee, i dunno... they did save my life...
speaker2: sorry?
speaker1: look, i don't know you, you don't know me, but... i hit a certain point, nothing meant anything. my work, the wife and kids-- with 'em, i was sick of it all, y'know? but crs... they changed everything. "are they for real?" who cares, maybe nothing is. to reality.
speaker3: c'mon pete.
speaker1: good luck, pal. you'll need it.

speaker1: excuse me. excuse me! postponing the baer-grace meeting is out of the question. schuyler gets on a plane for washington tomorrow morning at seven with every contract, every side agreement, the complete closing package! 
speaker2: but there's simply no--
speaker3: no is not an option. if you fail to recognize that, i'll find ten other law firms in the yellow pages that can get the job done--
speaker3: yes.
speaker3: yes, who
speaker3: i'm in a meeting-- cynthia --and i'm afraid you didn't qualify.
speaker3: --so i don't have time for-- excuse me, what was that? cynthia well... your application was rejected.
speaker3: ...why? cynthia oh, i'm afraid i don't have that information, but-- many applicants don't meet the criteria. we apologize, we hope it hasn't caused you any inconvenience--
speaker3: this is absurd-- cynthia thank you for thinking of crs.
speaker1: bad news, sky?
speaker3: no, nothing. sorry, bob. so were there any more questions, or may i assume it's under control...

speaker1: hello! what are you doing here? 
speaker1: wonderful. you ok? you dead?
speaker1:

speaker2: you want what i got, mon.
speaker1: no thank you.

speaker1: fine.

speaker1: you've been planning this for months, haven't you? sandbagging me like this, selling us for scrap... 
speaker2: bg lumber is not profitable and hasn't been for years, my duty is to salvage what i can. these are the closing papers, in ten minutes i'm going to present the sale terms to the shareholders and elect my new management team.
speaker1: i was friends with your father, you bastard, i watched you grow up, and now you kick me in the balls--

speaker1: you could've 
speaker2: never mind... we'll just have to go with the earlier draft.

speaker2: where are they.
speaker1: up your ass?
speaker2: up my ass, very funny...
speaker2: i don't-- ok. ok, you're with crs...
speaker2: so the game, it's just a screen, to blow this deal...
speaker1: i'm not following you.
speaker2: like you aren't. how did you get my brother involved, that's unforgivable.
speaker3: um... sorry to interrupt. we've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re-sent the material. it's all ok now.
speaker3: oh and mr. van orton-- are these yours? the pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper...
speaker2: everything seems to be in order. please disregard my last comments. the shareholders meeting is about to get underway... shall we?

speaker1: mon sorry oughta pay more attention. 
speaker2: listen, i quit.
speaker1: free at last... you won't be needin' this, then.

speaker2: i said i--
speaker1: help, help! the mon is crazy!

speaker1: where is it? 
speaker2: got something better.
speaker1: i realize you're just some bit player, but i'd like you to get a message to your employers. this is interfering with my work, it's breaking my concentration and i can't allow that to happen--
speaker1: if i take that stupid key, will you give me back my briefcase and go away?
speaker1: what the am i
speaker2: so try looking at it through rose- colored glasses... here.
speaker1: i told you, this is over! i quit!

speaker1: don't you have something for me?
speaker2: uh-huh sure, here you go.
speaker1: wait, you really work here--
speaker2: not anymore, thanks to you.

speaker1: slow down-- you don't understand, i thought it was a gag. 
speaker2: no, you don't understand. i carry mace and i know how to use it.
speaker1: i was only trying to apologize.
speaker2: it's in here somewhere--
speaker1: fine.
speaker2: shit--
speaker2: you got a phone, call an ambulance!

speaker2: what the is going on?!
speaker1: it's a little hard to explain...
speaker2: try!
speaker1: i seem to be playing a game. this is supposed to be funny--
speaker2: i don't get it.
speaker1: --a challenge, a puzzle.
speaker2: ok, i'm puzzled. where
speaker2: here's a lightswitch--
speaker1: i wouldn't--
speaker1: i don't know the rules, if there are any, but it seems the obvious move usually backfires...
speaker2: of course. i have no idea what you're talking about.
speaker2: son of a
speaker1: i think i have a key.
speaker1: it... wrong key...
speaker2: last match.

speaker1: sky van orton.
speaker2: sky? were your folks hippies or something?
speaker1: far from it.
speaker2: i'm christine kaminsky.
speaker1: nice to meet you.
speaker1: it's a company called consumer recreation services, crs. i never know what's gonna happen next.
speaker2: well, who does.
speaker1: until recently, i had a pretty good idea... duck.
speaker2: so are you like a serious masochist, or just really, really bored?
speaker1: i'm sorry, you shouldn't have been dragged into this.
speaker2: well... i have to tell you something. some guy came into leo's yesterday, showed me your picture, offered me 250 bucks to spill that food on you.
speaker1: ah.
speaker2: said it was a practical joke. i figured what the hell, i can use the money-- i got him up to 500. i hated that job anyway--
speaker1: wait, so the heart attack, you knew that was a joke too--
speaker2: no! it scared the out of me--
speaker1: but that cpr routine--
speaker2: i used to be a lifeguard.
speaker2: how do we get up there?

speaker1: well, that was pointless... but different... kind of fun... 
speaker2: mm, a different kind of fun.
speaker1: louise... why?
speaker2: you're supposed to be here... they picked you for a reason.
speaker1: but-- why?
speaker2: probably knew you'd play good samaritan for that guy, drag me along-- but they could have hired an actor for that, less of a risk...
speaker1: this is really sick. i think they're trying to fix us up.
speaker2: maybe you can't play alone--
speaker1: who says i want to play? ok, what the are you doing in the dumpster.
speaker2: there's something in here i need.
speaker1: what's that for?
speaker2: i imagine i'll find out.

speaker1: your turn. 
speaker2: find everything you need?
speaker1: you're outta conditioner.
speaker2: my apologies, i'll have it taken care of. help yourself to the fridge.

speaker1: so um... how rich are you anyway? 
speaker2: rich enough. bit forward, aren't you?
speaker1: well, what exactly do you do?
speaker2: manage investments, some venture capital, i'm on the board of a number of publicly traded companies...
speaker1: so you just like, move money around?
speaker2: basically. beats working, huh?
speaker1: you don't look so bad, without the tie.
speaker2: look, i hope you haven't been too put out... i could probably get you another job, i have a stake in a couple of restaurants--
speaker1: i'm not much of a waitress, really.
speaker2: can you type?
speaker1: kind of a turn-on, you know? i didn't mean-- just, the danger...
speaker2: mm. so where do you live?
speaker1: out in concord, with my folks, unfortunately. they're never gonna believe that i've been hanging out with a guy like you.
speaker2: what do you mean?
speaker1: nothing, just-- most of the guys i see have tats, y'know? tattoos...
speaker2: of course. we'd better head downstairs, the limo's waiting.

speaker1: mind if i smoke in here? 
speaker2: yes. up here on the left.
speaker1: so what's our next move? i mean, in the game. obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for--
speaker2: i'm not playing anymore.
speaker1: why not?
speaker2: i have a life. jack'll take you home, or wherever you want to go.
speaker1: yeah, maybe i'll get in a little ballroom dancing before bed--
speaker1: wait, what about your clothes?
speaker2: forget it.
speaker1: c'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt.
speaker2: no, it's not-- just-- back from the cleaners.
speaker1: see ya.
speaker2: good night.

speaker1: drive. anywhere. 
speaker2: david, you scared the out of me--
speaker1: i'm sorry sky, just drive, please-- schuyler pulls forward.
speaker2: where were you today?
speaker1: i almost didn't make it at all. i been in the bar for hours, waiting for you to come back to your car-- i can't believe i did this to you, i'm so sorry--
speaker2: slow down, take a breath-- what are you talking about?
speaker1: the game! it just doesn't stop! i thought i'd finished playing a long time ago, i paid the bill, then it started all over again, they won't leave me alone--
speaker2: calm down. what are they doing to you?
speaker1: everything. it just doesn't stop.
speaker2: look. that's crazy. yes, it's a pain in the ass, but why would they keep playing once you paid them?
speaker1: i don't know! i paid them more to make it stop, help me i even gave you to them... but they won't leave me alone!
speaker1: what's this?
speaker2: it was on my windshield--
speaker1: oh oh they must be following us--

speaker1: they're shooting at us! 
speaker2: david, get a grip, it's just a flat tire!
speaker2: it, the phone's not working--
speaker1: of course not.
speaker2: fine, i'll change the thing myself.
speaker1: just hurry-- i'll pop the trunk.
speaker2: no, you can't do it from--
speaker2: what the are those--
speaker1: like you don't know. they got to you first, didn't they?
speaker2: um, david-- hello?

speaker1: it's more than that isn't it? you're part of it, you're one of them! of course, it makes perfect sense! 
speaker2: they planted those keys! i don't know what the they're for--
speaker1: you're behind the whole thing aren't you? you and your sick friends set it up--
speaker2: what?! what friends? get a grip, david-- why would i do that?
speaker1: i don't know, out of boredom, to get back at me--
speaker2: for what?!
speaker1: for being a weirdo, for trying to be happy? well, congratulations, you win. now make it stop!
speaker2: i can't! listen to me--
speaker1: you!
speaker3: if you'd like to make a call, please hang up and dial again-- if you need help--

speaker1: you're heading the wrong way. cabbie relax, pal, you'll get where you're going. 
speaker1: why are you doing this-- cabbie/rasta we do it all for you! we're the best friends you got, no one ever worked so hard to make you feel alive... but you gotta let it happen...

speaker1: what the is this-- 
speaker2: have a nice day...

speaker1: thank you... i'm very grateful. 
speaker2: shouldn't swim in the bay, you could get hepatitis.
speaker1: i have to get in touch with the police.
speaker2: you're freezing, i got some dry clothes below.

speaker1: do you need any help? 
speaker2: uh, no. i'm fine. these fit... ...perfectly.
speaker1: sure i can't do something for you?
speaker2: i am finished playing.
speaker1: ow! let go!
speaker2: this has got to stop!
speaker1: you're hurting me!
speaker2: who are you!?
speaker1: i just got hired to show you a good time! c'mon please get off me...
speaker1: i am not into this kinda
speaker2: who hired you.
speaker1: i don't know, the service set it up.
speaker2: the service?
speaker1: y'know, fantasy girls. they said you had this wild fantasy, i should just wait in the boat...

speaker1: doncha want your thing? i'm supposed to give you this, this key thingie... 
speaker2: a key.
speaker1: they said you'd figure out what to do with it.
speaker2: i'm supposed to carry a hatchet around...? relax. i don't want it.

speaker1: thank you for your promptness, officers. i'm robert plympton, mr. van orton's attorney-- 
speaker2: let's go. seventh floor.

speaker1: management company for the building said this floor hasn't been rented. we checked with the secretary of state and the county recorder, there's no listing of a "consumer research service." 
speaker2: recreation service.
speaker1: right. no sign of the boat or the girl. divers got the cab's vehicle id, the company junked it a month ago.
speaker3: the numbers you gave us are disconnected, sir, this was the only address the phone company had. and we found your car-- it's in impound.
speaker1: i'm a little confused as to motive here. you said your brother sent you to these people...
speaker4: it's not his fault, he's unstable, he didn't know what he was doing--
speaker1: and they were supposed to show you a, a good time?
speaker3: my guess is this feingold guy's using an alias... is there anything else you can tell us about him?
speaker4: he likes chinese food...
speaker1: don't worry, mr. van orton, we'll get these jokers.

speaker1: there's clearly a civil case once we locate the defendant... 
speaker2: whatever.
speaker1: y'know, sky, things are quiet since the closing-- you could take some time off.

speaker1: no no no-- crs-man oh you're always so negative... 
speaker1: you people are insane... crs-man hey, look who's talking to their tv set.
speaker1: how did you do this, how did you get in here? crs-man simple, we duped your keys the day you came in for your physical, wired the whole house while you were at work. you rich people all have alarms, but you never set 'em, do you?
speaker1: look, at least leave my brother alone, he's fragile enough as it is-- crs-man don't worry about him, he's just playing his own game-- at a more advanced level, you might say...
speaker1: you can't just with people like this, you don't know who you're dealing with!
speaker1: we know

speaker3: last night, when jack dropped you off-- did anything happen?
speaker1: no... unfortunately.
speaker3: i thought-- eh, you don't wanna know.
speaker1: come on--
speaker3: i thought they kidnapped you, tortured you--
speaker1: what? who?
speaker3: crs... i saw pictures, girl with a tattoo on her shoulder like yours--
speaker1: ssh, my folks don't know about that yet. so, what-- they wanted ransom from you or something?
speaker3: no, i thought they were trying to frame me, they planted evidence...
speaker1: why would they do that?
speaker3: i have no idea, nothing they do makes any sense. forget it, it's just a game.
speaker1: so that's the only reason you came out here to east hell, your stupid game.
speaker3: i was worried about you. i wanted to see you again.
speaker1: if you pretend to mean that, i'll pretend to believe it. well, looks like your pals are trying to keep us together. buy me dinner at least?
speaker3: sure, why not.

speaker1: can you get us into chez panisse? i always wanted to eat there-- 
speaker2: is that you?

speaker1: don't be stupid. don't say anything, not here, they're watching.
speaker2: it...
speaker1: ok, i know a good place we could go and like, be alone...
speaker1: it's a beautiful night, isn't it?
speaker1: there's four of them in the van, they're armed. just play along, i'll get us out of here-- schuyler turns to her, his voice is tired.
speaker2: you. ok, that's it, game over--

speaker1: --you can come out now, assholes-- 
speaker2: we're blown, let's do it--

speaker1: you come on!

speaker2: get out of my car.
speaker1: i coulda handed you to them! they find me now i'm dead-- schuyler pushes harder.
speaker1: listen to me you bastard-- i know what's going on! no one else is gonna tell you!
speaker2: get in.

speaker1: you can talk while i drive to the police station. 
speaker2: no cops, i got an outstanding warrant. mail fraud. i'll get nailed, but you'll never be able to prove a thing.

speaker1: heard about this big swindle and-- i needed the money. you wouldn't know what that's like. 
speaker2: spare me the snide comments. and please don't do that in here--
speaker1: second-hand smoke is the least of your problems. they really screwed up, i can't believe they didn't take the time to get the house right.
speaker2: wait, how did-- before the game, you
speaker2: oh david's in on it...?
speaker1: it's not his fault, he thought it was the only way out... just another victim.
speaker2: how the did they think they were gonna get my money?
speaker1: honey, they already got it.
speaker1: you don't believe me, check your bank accounts. listen, that night in your office, remember? i downloaded files off your computer while you were in the shower...

speaker1: i stuck in a code-breaking program to glve crs remote access to van orton group files... 
speaker1: --you'd already given them everything else they needed. your handwriting, voice samples, personal information, all the tests you took... they used the data to generate your passwords.
speaker1: from there they just had to break into the financial networks, transfer your holdings into some dummy accounts--
speaker1: remember jim feingold, guy who signed you up? he's one of the original hackers, did a five-year stretch for zapping citibank.
speaker1: he's not some dweeb flunkie, he runs the whole show.

speaker1: i'm sorry. they already did your brother, i guess they figured you for a family of suckers... schuyler overseas operator? please dial the number for allgemeine bank in zurich... 
speaker1: bet you haven't really been taking care of business the past few days, huh? this "game," the psych about your dad going sui... schuyler guten tag-- vilen dank, englisch...

speaker1: they say i gotta confiscate your card... 
speaker2: i think i have some cash.

speaker1: money isn't everything, right? 
speaker2: it might be best if you didn't speak. i very nearly crushed your skull just now.

speaker2: just under a billion dollars.
speaker1: a bil--? you're kidding, right?

speaker1: well, that was stupid.
speaker1: ok, they've gotten to him. ok.
speaker2: mm... i wouldn't worry about it.
