speaker1: that was pretty what you were whistling. whistle some more. 
speaker1: you got a cigarette?
speaker2: oh, i think so--
speaker2: filter tips.
speaker1: you smoke it. smoke it, dad.

speaker1: mixed up in that beating on twelfth street? 
speaker2: no. plain drunkenness.
speaker1: this says he was picked up there.
speaker2: they had him on the carpet for an hour at headquarters. he's clear.
speaker1: young squirt. all right--you want to lean him against something? stand him over there.
speaker3: you going to tell me your name now?
speaker4: where's your hair?
speaker3: it's all gone.
speaker4: did you get a haircut?
speaker3: no--it just fell out!
speaker4: aw--
speaker5: what gang does he belong to?
speaker3: give him a couple of years.
speaker5: where's your mamma, honey?
speaker4: i don't know.
speaker5: judy--we're ready for you now.
speaker6: he hates me.
speaker5: what?
speaker6: he hates me.
speaker5: what makes you think he hates you, judy?
speaker6: i don't think. i know. he looks at me like i'm the ugliest thing in the world. he doesn't like my friends--he-- ray leads her into the office.
speaker5: he makes you feel pretty unhappy?
speaker6: he calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
speaker5: do you think your father means that?
speaker6: yes! i don't know! i mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does. we're altogether and we're going to celebrate easter and catch a double bill. big deal. so i put on my new dress and i came out and he--
speaker5: that one?
speaker6: yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming. he grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till i thought i wouldn't have any lips left. and all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing i told you he called me. then i ran out of the house.
speaker5: is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
speaker6: i was just talking a walk. i tried to call the kids but everybody was out and i couldn't find them. i hate my life. i just hate it.
speaker5: you weren't looking for company, were you?
speaker6: no.
speaker5: did you stop to talk to anyone, judy? do you enjoy that?
speaker6: no. i don't even know why i do it.
speaker5: do you think you can get back at your dad that way? i mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention. did you ever think of that?
speaker6: i'll never get close to anybody.
speaker5: some kids stomped a man on twelfth street, judy.
speaker6: you know where they picked me up! twelfth street! i wasn't even near there!
speaker5: would you like to go home if we can arrange it? did you notify the parents?
speaker7: she wouldn't give me their number.
speaker5: what's your number, judy? we'll see if your dad will come and get you.
speaker5: unless you really don't want to go home. would you rather stay here?
speaker6: lexington 05549.
speaker2: hey!
speaker2: hey! that's enough static out of you.

speaker5: your mother will be down in a few minutes, judy--
speaker6: what?
speaker5: your mother will be down in a few minutes.

speaker6: nobody can help me.
speaker1: can you tell me why you killed the puppies, plato?
speaker6: no, sir. i just went next door to look at them like i always do. they were nursing on their mother and i did it. i guess i'm just no good?
speaker1: what do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?

speaker2: they not together, sir. we don't see him in a long time now.
speaker1: do you hear from him, son?
speaker1: you know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
speaker6: head-shrinker?
speaker2: oh, mrs. crawford don't believe in them!
speaker1: well maybe she better start.
speaker5: i don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
speaker7: you don't?
speaker5: no. i definitely don't. i did the sa--
speaker7: he's a minor, mr. stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
speaker5: say, listen--
speaker3: jim--don't hum.
speaker5: i guess i cut pretty loose in my day too.
speaker3: really, frank? when was that?
speaker5: listen--can't you wait till we get home?
speaker7: whoa! whoa! i know you're a little upset but--
speaker5: sorry.
speaker7: what about you, jim? got anything to say for yourself?
speaker7: not interested, huh?
speaker3: can't you answer? what's the matter with you anyhow?
speaker5: he's just loaded, honey.
speaker3: i was talking to jim.
speaker5: let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand? the kid has no friends yet and--
speaker4: tell him why we moved here.
speaker5: hold it, jim.
speaker4: you can't protect me.
speaker5: you mind if i try? you have to slam the door in my face? i try to get to him--what happens? don't i give you everything you want? a bicycle--you get a bicycle.
speaker4: you buy me many things. thank you.
speaker5: not just buy! you hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough. we give you love and affection, don't we?
speaker5: then what is it? i can't even touch you anymore but you pull away. i want to understand you. why'd you get drunk? you must have had a reason.
speaker5: was it because we went to that party? you know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
speaker3: a minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
speaker8: he said a little drink.
speaker4: you're tearing me apart!
speaker3: what?
speaker4: stop tearing me apart! you say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
speaker3: that's a fine way to behave!
speaker8: well you know who he takes after!
speaker7: outside, jim. come outside.
speaker7: excuse us a minute?
speaker5: sure. sure.
speaker4: someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
speaker7: grandma?
speaker4: get lost.
speaker7: hang loose, boy. i'm warning you.
speaker4: wash up and go home.
speaker7: big tough character. you don't kid me, pal. how come you're not wearing your boots?
speaker7: too bad you didn't connect. you could have gone to juvenile hall.
speaker4: no.
speaker7: sure it is. you want to bug us till we have to lock you up. why?
speaker4: leave me alone.
speaker7: no.
speaker4: i don't know why--!
speaker7: go on--don't give me that. someone giving you hard looks?
speaker4: i just get so-- boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up.
speaker7: okay. okay. let it out.
speaker7: you feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
speaker4: all the time! i don't know what gets into me--but i keep looking for trouble and i always--i swear you better lock me up. i'm going to smash somebody--i know it.
speaker7: try the desk.
speaker7: that why you moved from the last town? 'cause you were in trouble? you can talk about it if you want to--i know about it anyway.
speaker4: and they think they are protecting my by moving.
speaker7: you were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there.
speaker4: mess that kid up?
speaker4: he called me chicken.
speaker7: and your folks didn't understand?
speaker4: they never do.
speaker7: so then you moved?
speaker4: they think i'll make friends if we move. just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
speaker7: but you don't think that's a solution.
speaker7: things pretty tough for you at home?
speaker4: she eats him alive and he takes it.
speaker4: what a zoo!
speaker7: what?
speaker4: a zoo. he always wants to be my pal, you know? but how can i give him anything when he's--i mean i love him and i don't want to hurt him--but i don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
speaker7: pretty mixed up?
speaker4: if he could--
speaker7: "if he could" what? you mean your father?
speaker4: i mean if he had the guts to knock mom cold once i bet she'd be happy and i bet she'd stop picking. they make mush out of him. just mush. one thing i know is i never want to be like him.
speaker7: chicken?
speaker4: i bet you see right through me, don't you?
speaker4: how can anyone grow up in this circus?
speaker7: you got me, jim--but they do. want some water?
speaker4: boy--if i had one day when i didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or i felt i belonged some place.
speaker7: here. look, will you do something for me? if the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze. it's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
speaker4: okay--
speaker7: any time--day or night. you calmed down enough to go back now?
speaker4: you serious? ray smiles and opens the door.
speaker4: i'm sorry.
speaker3: all right, darling.
speaker8: this was all very unfortunate, but he made a mistake and he's sorry-- so we're not going to have any more trouble. he's always been a lovely boy--
speaker4: lovely! grandma--if you tell another lie you're going to turn to stone.
speaker7: luck, jim. don't forget.
speaker5: have some cigars.
speaker7: no thanks, i don't smoke.
speaker5: go on--give 'em to your friends.
speaker7: no--thanks, very much, mr. stark.

speaker1: what are you trying to do, get yourself killed?
speaker2: yes!
speaker3: your eggs are on the table, dear.
speaker3: sit down and eat--you'll be late.
speaker4: it'd stick in my throat, mom. i'm nervous or something--
speaker5: it's a wonder we don't all have tb or some other terrible disease after living in all those smokey cities!
speaker3: well, drink your milk anyhow.
speaker5: there aren't so many factories here.
speaker6: mother--
speaker4: you make any sandwiches?
speaker6: my first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly i could never even swallow till recess--
speaker3: there's nothing to be nervous about. here's peanut butter and meat loaf--
speaker5: what did i tell you? peanut butter!
speaker3: well, there's a thermos of orange juice and some apple-sauce cake in the wax paper to wash it down.
speaker5: i baked that!
speaker4: 'bye, mom.
speaker3: goodbye, dear.
speaker6: so long, young fella. knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
speaker4: sure-- you know something? i have a feeling we're going to stay here.

speaker4: where's university and 10th?
speaker1: that way!
speaker8: that way!
speaker7: that way!

speaker1: hi--can you tell we where i go? 
speaker2: mr. bassett's office--203. he'll tell you where your home room is--
speaker1: thanks a lot. jim moves out.
speaker3: hi.
speaker3: hi.
speaker1: hi there.
speaker3: you remember me?
speaker1: no. i don't think so--
speaker3: i'm sorry--i made a mistake.

speaker1: for many days before the end of our earth people will look into the night sky and notice a star, increasingly bright and increasingly near. 
speaker1: as this star approaches us, the weather will change. the great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide, and the seas will turn warmer.
speaker1: the last of us search the heavens and stand amazed. for the stars will still be there, moving through their ancient rhythms.
speaker1: the familiar constellations that illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed, eternal, unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and its demise.
speaker1: orion, the hunter. plato looks off.
speaker2: boy!
speaker3: what?
speaker2: once you been up there, you know you been some place!
speaker1: gemini, the twins.
speaker1: cancer, the crab.
speaker4: i'm a crab! she laughs. so do the others.
speaker1: taurus, the bull.
speaker2: moo! he waits for approval.
speaker5: yeah, moo.
speaker4: moo. that's real cute. moo.
speaker6: hey, he's real rough--
speaker5: i bet he fights with cows.
speaker4: moo.
speaker1: sagittarius and aries--all as they have ever been.
speaker3: you shouldn't monkey with him.
speaker2: what?
speaker3: he's a wheel. so's she. it's hard to make friends with them.
speaker2: i don't want to make friends.
speaker1: and while the flash of our beginning has not yet traveled the light years into distance--
speaker1: has not yet been seen by planets deep within the other galaxies, we will disappear into the blackness of the space from which we came.
speaker1: destroyed as we began in a burst of gas and fire.
speaker1: the heavens are still and cold once more. in all the complexity of our universe and the galaxies beyond, the earth will not be missed.
speaker1: through the infinite reaches of space, the problems of man seem trivial and naive indeed. and man, existing alone, seems to be an episode of little consequences.
speaker1: that's all. thank you very much.
speaker2: hey, it's over. the world ended.
speaker3: what does he know about man alone?
speaker3: excuse me. excuse me.
speaker7: john, where you going?
speaker3: i forgot something. i'll get a hitch.
speaker4: what you looking at?
speaker3: nothing.
speaker3: what's your name!
speaker2: jim. what's yours?
speaker3: plato. it's a nickname.
speaker3: listen, i told you not to fool with them. now they're waiting for you.
speaker2: i know. that's why i came back.
speaker3: you scared?
speaker2: i just don't want trouble.
speaker3: he has a knife.
speaker2: i saw it. gee, look at that thing swing, will you? do you think it never stops?
speaker3: no. it's perpetual motion.
speaker2: oh, i bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it. go- go-go!
speaker3: jim?
speaker2: i'm here.
speaker3: they're still there!
speaker3: jim--do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
speaker2: no. in the morning.
speaker2: i just have a feeling.
speaker3: if you don't want trouble, i know a place we can go-- jim looks up at him.
speaker3: it's a big mansion and we could sneak around there and they wouldn't even know. you could be safe-- they turn a corner quickly.
speaker3: there it is.
speaker3: should we go?
speaker2: you know something?
speaker4: what?
speaker2: you watch too much television. med. shot. the group and jim. judy has come to buzz, stands on the wall above him.

speaker2: you shouldn't call me that.
speaker2: i thought only punks fought with knives.

speaker5: i didn't want to stop.
speaker6: didn't want to stop what?
speaker4: nothing.
speaker5: i was talking to dad.
speaker4: i didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
speaker6: bertha! you can serve the souffle! fish souffle. you don't have to stand there, darling. drink your tomato juice.
speaker5: i guess i just don't understand anything.
speaker4: i'm tired, judy. i'd like to change the subject.
speaker5: why?
speaker4: i'd like to, that's all. girls your age don't do that. you need an explanation?
speaker5: girls don't love their father? since when? since i got to be sixteen?

speaker1: what would you do, dad?
speaker2: i wouldn't do anything hasty. let's get a little light on the subject. the father turns on the light and looks at jim who is now sitting on the edge of the bed. he removes his jacket and the shirt is revealed. the father stares.
speaker1: blood.
speaker2: how'd that happen! what kind of trouble you in?
speaker1: the kind we've been talking about.

speaker3: if you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to-- gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
speaker2: hey...you flipped--or something?
speaker3: o.k. g'night. i got to pick up my scooter. see you tomorrow.
speaker2: yeah.
speaker4: hello, little cute sister.
speaker4: hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor- puss, sweetie-- judy touches beau's head and tries to smile.
speaker5: he's home! you're home! you're all right! the camera rights itself suddenly.
speaker5: what happened, darling. we were so worried. i was going to take a sleeping pill, but i wouldn't till i knew you were home.
speaker2: i have to talk to someone, mom. i have to talk to you both. and dad this time you got to give me an answer.
speaker6: go ahead.
speaker2: i'm in terrible trouble.--you know that big high bluff near miller- town junction?
speaker6: sure--there was a bad accident there. they showed the pictures on

speaker1: i was in it. 
speaker2: how!
speaker1: it doesn't matter how. i was driving a stolen car--
speaker2: do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
speaker1: mom--i'm not--
speaker2: and you wanted him to make a list!
speaker3: will you let him tell it!
speaker1: she never wants to hear. she doesn't care!
speaker2: i guess when i nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much i don't care!
speaker3: just relax, please relax!
speaker1: i told you dad, it was a question of honor. they called me chicken-- you know, chicken! i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again. so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other. we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff. i got out okay but buzz didn't. he was killed.
speaker2: good lord!
speaker1: i can't keep it to myself anymore--
speaker3: well, just get it off your chest, son.
speaker1: that's not what i mean. i've never done anything right. i've been going around with my head in a sling for years...i don't want to drag you into this but i can't help it. i don't think i can prove anything by going around pretending i'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
speaker3: you're absolutely right!
speaker1: are you listening to me? you're involved in this! i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight?
speaker3: you what?
speaker2: no!
speaker3: did anyone see you there? i mean did they get your license number or anything?
speaker1: i don't think so--
speaker3: well--
speaker2: what about the other boys--do you think they'll go to the police?
speaker1: what's that got to do with it?
speaker2: why should you be the only one.
speaker3: look jim. far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
speaker2: are you going to preach now? are we going to have a sermon?
speaker3: i'm just explaining what you mean! you can't be an idealist all your life! nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
speaker2: that's right!
speaker1: except yourself!
speaker3: will you wait a minute?
speaker1: you don't want me to go.
speaker2: no! i don't want you to go to the police! there were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
speaker1: but i am involved! we're all involved, mom! a boy was killed! i don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
speaker3: you know you did wrong. that's the main thing, isn't it?
speaker1: no! it's nothing! just nothing! you always told me to tell the truth. you think you can just turn that off?
speaker2: he's not saying that! he's saying don't volunteer!
speaker1: just tell a little white lie?
speaker3: you'll learn as you get a little older, jim.
speaker1: i don't want to learn that!
speaker2: well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
speaker1: no! you're not tearing me loose any more.
speaker2: do i have to spell it out?
speaker1: you're not going to use me as an excuse again, mom. every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. now i want to do one thing right and i'm not letting you run away. dad?
speaker3: son--this is all happening so fast--
speaker1: you better give me something, dad. you better give me something mom?
speaker2: jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
speaker1: dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
speaker1: dad?
speaker2: stop it! you'll kill him! jim! do you want to kill your father?

speaker1: let go of me-- 
speaker2: you want a good crack in the mouth?
speaker3: this place appeal to you or something?
speaker3: what's he going to pull--
speaker1: nothing, crunch. they picked him up like the rest of--

speaker1: yeah. yeah.
speaker2: we're following you so better get there.
speaker3: you see any cops?

speaker3: he's going to cheese, i tell you.
speaker1: i think i should go home.
speaker3: no. we're going to bring him down.
speaker1: crunch--my father's--you going to kill him?
speaker4: w-o-j-t-what?
speaker5: o-w-i-c-z. wojtowicz. what's the matter, man? that's the craziest name in town! it swings!

speaker4: what you doing! what you doing to him! you clear out of here 'fore i call the police!
speaker4: clear out. go on! go on now!
speaker5: let's go, crunch.
speaker4: why you like to mix with bad boys like that? why you get in trouble all the--
speaker1: i have to go out. i have to warn him.
speaker4: you not going anywhere! you
speaker4: john! what you doing with that! you leave that be! put it down before you hurt yourself. hear me?
speaker4: john! you stay home! john! john!

speaker1: coming up now another request--this time from the boys down at anna's pizza paradise--a new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues. jim, this is dedicated to you--from buzz. jim stares at the radio, then turns it off. 
speaker2: they'll be looking for you.
speaker3: they saw where i jumped! i didn't chicken! what do i have to do-- kill myself?
speaker2: it doesn't matter to them.
speaker3: you were looking for me, weren't you?

speaker2: neither can i.
speaker3: no? why not? you know something? sometimes i figure i'll never live to see my next birthday. isn't that dumb?
speaker2: no.
speaker3: every day i look in the mirror and say, "what? you still here?" man!
speaker3: hey! you smiled!
speaker3: like even today. i woke up this morning, you know? and the sun was shining and everything was nice. then the first thing that happens is i see you and i thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
speaker2: i'm sorry i treated you mean today. you shouldn't believe what i say when i'm with the kids. nobody acts sincere.
speaker3: why'd you get mixed up with them?
speaker2: if you knew me you wouldn't say that.
speaker3: i don't think you trust anybody, do you?
speaker2: why?
speaker3: i'm getting that way, too.
speaker2: have you ever gone with anyone who--
speaker3: sure. lots of times.
speaker2: so have i. but i've never been in love. isn't that awful?
speaker3: awful? no. it's just lonely. it's the loneliest time.
speaker2: why did you do that?
speaker3: i felt like it.
speaker2: your lips are soft when you kiss.
speaker3: where you going?
speaker2: i don't know, but we can't stay here.
speaker3: where can we go? i can't go back into that zoo.
speaker2: i'm never going back.

speaker3: you decide, darling. remember our budget.
speaker1: don't give it a thought. only three million dollars a month!
speaker3: oh, we can manage that! i'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
speaker2: why don't we just rent it for the season?
speaker3: you see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling. i'm so embarrassed i could die!
speaker2: well--we're newlyweds.
speaker3: there's just one thing. what about--
speaker1: children? well, we really don't encourage them. they're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
speaker3: yes. and so terribly annoying when they cry. i just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
speaker2: of course. drown them like puppies.
speaker3: see, we're very modern.
speaker1: shall i show you the nursery? it's far away from the rest of the house. if you have children--oh i hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice. in fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
speaker3: talk to them! heavens!
speaker2: nobody talks to children! they just tell them one thing and mean another.
speaker1: it's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too! you know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: there's only one key.
speaker2: we'll take it!
speaker1: come on!

speaker1: what time is it? 
speaker2: hang loose. we got all night.
speaker1: that maid saw us. she could identify us too.
speaker2: you still want to go home, moose?
speaker1: no.
speaker2: then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
speaker3: what guts?

speaker1: quick! fill the pool! 
speaker1: let's see how long we can stay under.

speaker2: isn't he schizoid?
speaker1: hey! how 'bout that!
speaker2: haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
speaker1: not lately.
speaker1: how do you know so much about this junk, plato?
speaker2: i had to go to a head-shrinker. i only went twice though. my mother said it cost too much, so she went to hawaii instead.
speaker1: no. seriously. what's your trouble?
speaker2: i don't know but whatever it is, it's gone now. i mean i'm happy now. here.

speaker2: are you?
speaker1: here we are-- out of cigarettes-- junior's in the nurs'ry-- see how late it gets--
speaker2: you don't need to do that.
speaker1: there's something i should tell you, judy.
