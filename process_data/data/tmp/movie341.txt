speaker1: you know, crowd, these ladies are fine, but let me tell you the three reasons men prefer sheep: they're always in the mood, they never and after you 'em you can eat 'em. 
speaker1: and now, here's a lady that's always in the mood, put your hands together for the lovely and talented ms. cory...! applause. a syncopated drum beat kicks in. aerosmith's latest erupts from the speakers. and then she comes on.

speaker1: hi. you're nobody. 
speaker2: shhh. don't tell anyone.
speaker1: that's what cory said. she said you were nobody.
speaker2: easy, junior, i'm not raining on your parade. she's too young for me. i'm just keeping an eye on her for a few days.
speaker1: i see. what are you, some kind of bodyguard?
speaker2: something like that. you got a cigarette?
speaker1: no. is cory in trouble?
speaker2: i hope not. you tell me.
speaker1: she didn't mention anything to me.
speaker2: mmmm. that bothers you, doesn't it?

speaker1: maybe. 
speaker2: don't sweat it. women have secrets. water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets. i'll buy you a beer. sit down.
speaker1: she hired you, huh? what, you in the phonebook?
speaker2: yeah. actually, she hired my buddy mike. i'm filling in.
speaker1: where's mike?
speaker2: he died.
speaker1: sorry to hear it.
speaker2: don't be. he was a lousy surveillance man. jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table.
speaker1: look, friend, i don't know who you are or what's going on. but cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, i want to hear about it.
speaker2: that's client confidential.
speaker1: tell me anyway.
speaker2: nope.
speaker1: i say two words to cory and you don't get paid,

speaker1: do it. 
speaker2: you sure? i'm looking at your suit, you could use the dough.

speaker2: good, 'cause you're not getting any.
speaker1: story of my life.

speaker2: you know who i am?
speaker1: james alexander dix, l.a. stallions, '86 and '87. barred from the n.f.l. on gambling charges. allegations of point shaving to support a cocaine habit, never proven.

speaker1: mister... you are now me off. 
speaker2: about time. joe hallenbeck. i'm a private detective.

speaker2: at least i didn't my talent away on coke, motherfucker.
speaker1: can i hit you now?
speaker2: absolutely.
speaker2: please, have a seat.
speaker1: you think you're some kind of hot tough guy, huh?
speaker2: it's not a question of tough. i'm bigger than you, and i was trained. so i can take you. that's just the way it is. you can throw a better pass. how about that beer?

speaker1: off. 
speaker2: you were a great quarterback, jimmy. i watched you play at washington state. red shirt freshman in '82. followed you with the stallions. good scrambling ability, seventy percent completions from the pocket... you had the best gun in the n.f.l. jimmy looks at him, puzzled. didn't they just swap punches?
speaker1: yeah. thanks. i guess.
speaker2: hell. i'm a fan.

speaker1: alex the pediatrician. 
speaker2: alex the pediatrician.

speaker1: i didn't vote for you, you bastard. 
speaker1: you're a lowlife, joe.

speaker1: that's him. he was with her. 
speaker2: he's packing. what should we do?
speaker3: get him away from here. then kill him.
speaker2: there's no contract for him.
speaker3: then do it for free. just do it elsewhere.
speaker2: start walking. i'm right behind you.

speaker1: wrong place at the wrong time, buddy, that's all it is. just want you to know it's nothing personal. 
speaker2: that's what you think. last night i your wife.
speaker1: oh, you did, huh? how'd you know it was my wife?
speaker2: she said her husband was a greaseball with bad breath.
speaker1: you're pretty cool for a guy gonna take a bullet.
speaker2: after your wife, i'll take two.
speaker1: you're a funny guy. it's a shame to take you off. here, kneel down.
speaker2: are you kidding? we barely know each other. the hitman is now giggling, shaking his head.
speaker1: this is wild. i never shot no funny guy before.

speaker1: you need a special funny bullet. 
speaker2: come on, cut it out. head or chest?
speaker1: that's what your wife said.
speaker2: would you quit with the wife?
speaker1: ask me how fat she is.
speaker2: how fat is she?
speaker1: she's so fat i had to roll her in flour and look for the wet spot. you wanna her, you gotta slap her thigh and ride the wave in. like the pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke her in the stomach, she farts. i got a buddy he's an archaeologist, organized an expedition to her chin. they got lost in her nasal hair. but seriously, her eyes are like the streets of paris: crossed. they're so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back.

speaker1: bastard. 
speaker2: and then some. the guy pitches over dead. hallenbeck kneels beside him.
speaker2: i'm playing tahoe on the 15th.

speaker1: i can't believe it. the split on me. i'm staying at a motel for a couple days. will you follow me? 
speaker2: sure.

speaker1: passes jimmy. accelerating. engine revving. 
speaker2: oh this is a hit this is a hit!!
speaker1: comes up behind cory. comes up fast.

speaker1: cory, get out of there!! 
speaker2: hey, can't you drive??

speaker1: stands outside a door marked office. 
speaker2: it's all over, compadre.
speaker3: get off my property, mister.

speaker1: something stinks in here. my it's this statement! he flings the paper onto his desk. mccaskey sarge? 
speaker1: it's hallenbeck is hiding something.

speaker1: i know how the bastard's mind works. every lie has eighty percent truth to it. guy scares me. 
speaker1: go ahead. tell me what you see. mccaskey i see a guy, looks like he just slept in his suit.
speaker1: yep. that's what most people see. mccaskey there's more?
speaker1: oh, yeah. there's more. a long time ago, that son of a saved the president's life.

speaker1: that stuff cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her. that was all bullshit, wasn't it...? 
speaker2: yeah. i don't know what she was into, but those were professional hitters tonight. mob style. tell me about cory. what was she like?

speaker1: none of your business. 
speaker2: listen up, friend. i'm trying to get a handle on this. how was she fixed for money?
speaker1: i don't know. pretty strapped, i guess.
speaker2: always kept an eye out for work?
speaker1: no hooking, if that's what you mean.
speaker2: it isn't. tell me what she did at the club, besides dance.
speaker1: the usual. waitressing. get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. sit in a private booth, let the poor spill his troubles. used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist.
speaker2: she get many high rollers?
speaker1: sure. even rich guys get lonely.
speaker2: fine. so suppose one night, her 'guest' gets a little too drunk, and brags to her... reveals something about himself. something that could hurt if it came out. what would she do?
speaker1: i don't get it.
speaker2: would she blackmail him?
speaker1: i've had about enough of you --

speaker1: would she consider the possibility of blackmail? 
speaker2: she'd consider it. if she could get away with it. but she'd need hard evidence. otherwise, it's 'i never said that,' his word against hers.
speaker1: right. so what does she do?
speaker2: i don't know. follow the guy? have him followed?
speaker1: bingo. kid, this is making sense. she hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence.
speaker2: who does she hire?
speaker1: ah. she hires my buddy mike. right? right. it makes sense.
speaker2: except you told me that mike was a surveillance man.
speaker1: exactly. he got spotted. they made him, and they killed him.
speaker2: christ, what did the two of them stumble onto?
speaker1: whatever it was, it was way over their heads. they knew they were in trouble.
speaker2: how you figure?

speaker1: because mike was scared. he bailed out and threw the case in my lap. 
speaker2: he handed it to you... without telling you how dangerous it was?
speaker1: he was my wife, jimmy. i die. he gets my wife. jimmy just looks at him.

speaker1: this shirt cost me eighty bucks. 
speaker2: glad to see, at a time like this, at least you got your priorities straight.
speaker1: do me a favor and shut up. you think i don't care that cory's dead? christ, i feel like i been rode hard and put away wet.

speaker1: get some sleep. 
speaker2: wow. what stunning advice. i was gonna go hiking.
speaker1: you.
speaker2: you know something, joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks.
speaker1: how's this? you and the horse that looks like you.
speaker2: get some sleep.
speaker3: you look real familiar. do i know you?
speaker2: you might. some people recognize me.
speaker3: got it. peanuts morton. used to sell hash in crenshaw district.
speaker2: no, man. i played football.
speaker3: what position?
speaker2: forget it.
speaker3: football. free agents ruined the game.

speaker1: we gotta cross the parking lot. 
speaker2: you.
speaker1: hey, snappy comeback. you a detective?
speaker2: that son of a

speaker1: what the are you trying to do, tarzan? 
speaker2: he hit the chick.
speaker1: you don't start a fight in a police station, are you really this stupid or did you take lessons?
speaker2: guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all i'm saying. he just shouldn't, okay?
speaker1: why? because they're weak and need protecting?

speaker1: mind if i catch a ride with you? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: my car's up, remember?
speaker2: take the bus.
speaker1: cut it out. look, you sorta saved my life. let me buy you a beer.
speaker2: i'm not thirsty. good night.
speaker1: that's it. good night?
speaker2: go home. get some sleep.
speaker1: what are you gonna do?
speaker2: i'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend.
speaker1: what's the message?

speaker1: that we're out of it. that whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us. 
speaker2: you're kidding.
speaker2: you're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? i watch t.v., what the kind of private eye doesn't do anything?
speaker1: the kind with a wife and kid.
speaker2: you your job is done. we witnessed a murder, joe!
speaker1: yes, it was very exciting. tomorow i'll take you to the zoo. you wanna play hero, go ahead. when you die, i'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts.
speaker2: look, until this is over, i'm sticking with you.
speaker1: the you are.
speaker2: i'm part of this. we do something, we do it together.
speaker1: have a ncie night.
speaker2: don't drive away, joe.

speaker1: joe -- ! i'll tell the cops, joe. 
speaker2: tell them what, jimmy?
speaker1: that mike miller was your wife. only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for miller's death. when they find out mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno. i'm scared, and i'm coming with you, got it?
speaker2: you little creep, i'm gonna beat the out of you.
speaker1: go for it. then the cops'll really love my story. you don't start a fight in a police station,
speaker2: you and me is not a fight. you and me is a massacre.
speaker1: gosh, you're tough.

speaker2: that's me. every night. where did cory live?
speaker1: she had an apartment on the west side. why?
speaker2: i want to check it out.
speaker1: i thought you were off the case.
speaker2: look, dipshit, i told you that to keep you out of my hair. my client's dead and i haven't earned my fee.
speaker1: whoa, back up. you mean, we're gonna nail these after all...? i knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior.
speaker2: yeah, i'm a prince. shut the up.

speaker2: yeah, there's some really nice rubble.

speaker1: i may have something. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: later. let's get out of here.

speaker1: cory has two cars?
speaker2: yeah. this one's just sitting here until she can sell it.
speaker1: jimmy, no!!

speaker1: they used a car bomb on mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too. except they wired the wrong car. 
speaker2: oh. oh. jeez.
speaker1: easy, kid. no harm, no foul. we caught it in time. he strolls toward his plymouth, whistling. cheerfully unaffected. jimmy catches his breath. swallows hard.
speaker2: what are you doing? hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
speaker1: gotta disconnect the
speaker2: whoa. hold on. um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something?
speaker1: relax, junior, i used to do this for a living. he isolates one wire. turns and offers the cutters to jimmy.
speaker1: you wanna do it?
speaker2: no, man, i --

speaker1: come on, chickenshit. just snip the wire. 
speaker1: oh, not that one!
speaker2: you're a asshole!
speaker1: and then some, junior. and then some.

speaker1: we'll hand this over to the cops. 
speaker2: great. so what now?
speaker1: you tell me, kid.
speaker2: give up? flee? go really far away?
speaker1: i got a better idea. let's check in with my family.
speaker1: i'm tired. you drive.

speaker1: sure. family, huh? you got kids? 
speaker2: yeah. little girl.
speaker1: does she like you?
speaker2: not much, no. and she likes prince, so go figure.
speaker1: i like prince.
speaker2: great, you can marry my daughter. or better yet, my wife. i hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid i.d.'s. open the trunk.
speaker1: you're just gonna stick that in your trunk?
speaker2: you're right. let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with. jimmy opens the trunk. as he does, however, a voice rings out suddenly from the darkness.
speaker3: hold it right there, gentlemen.
speaker4: are approaching from out of the trees.
speaker1: is it the cops?
speaker2: no, jimmy. it's not the cops.

speaker1: good evening, gentlemen. bit late for a stroll, don't you think? 
speaker2: yeah, you two better be getting home.
speaker3: the streetlights are on.
speaker1: that's amusing. how delightful to find such amusing men so late at night. i don't believe i've had the pleasure.
speaker2: no, i don't believe you have. he'd like to have the pleasure.
speaker3: tell him it's not for sale.
speaker2: he says it's --
speaker4: what's your name, fuckface?
speaker2: i'm he's fuckface.
speaker1: jake, apprise rodney dangerfield here of his situation.

speaker1: perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes? 
speaker2: easy... jim... all they want is the evidence...
speaker1: the evidence. very smart. see, jake, he knows when a situation is untenable. you like that word?
speaker2: great word.
speaker1: it occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question.
speaker2: give up, jimmy. we're dealing with geniuses.
speaker3: leave him alone, you
speaker2: back off, jimmy.
speaker1: leave him alone...? whatever you say. jake?

speaker1: ah, my young friend... i neglected to tell you that jake attacks his job with a certain... exuberance. 
speaker2: i'm being beat up by the inventor of scrabble.
speaker1: he's still in a good mood, jake. kick him again.
speaker3: wait!
speaker3: you want the evidence that the stripper had. i've got it. so we can play games, or i can hand it over.
speaker2: and then you'll let us go, right?
speaker1: sure. we'll let you go. where is it?
speaker3: hand me the car keys, jimmy.
speaker1: walk over and hand him the keys. slow and easy.
speaker3: the evidence is in the trunk.
speaker1: open it. slow.

speaker1: i don't think so. 
speaker1: oops. i guess nobody gets it.
speaker2: you bastard, you're going to pay for that. jake, open the trunk.

speaker1: continue to careen down the hillside. 
speaker2: christ! they both dive for cover, out of the way. barely make it. the car plows past them in a shower of dirt. crumpling. heaving. spitting fire. finally slams to a halt against a palm tree. burns. the night is filled with shouts and curses.

speaker1: you alive? 
speaker2: don't know yet.
speaker2: the dynamite?
speaker1: either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall.
speaker2: dead guys... don't make bad jokes, right?
speaker1: right.
speaker2: so we're alive.
speaker1: yeah. hooray.

speaker1: go. get out of here. 
speaker2: what?
speaker1: get the out of here, i'll take the heat on this one. rent a car. then go home and wait for my call. do it.

speaker1: if you thought there was dynamite in the trunk, wait'll you see this. 
speaker1: the guy on the left is connie marcon, the owner of the l.a.
speaker2: forget about him. look at the guy on the right.
speaker1: sort of familiar. who is he?
speaker2: senator calvin baynard.
speaker1: let's go back to the cops. i'm scared.
speaker2: take it easy, kid. it's not so bad.

speaker1: not so bad. excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad? you don't understand, joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there.' it's vomit, okay? this is bad. hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette. 
speaker2: when i was thirty, i was on the president's personal security force. once night i was on the way home from a late session. i'm on the highway just outside of georgetown when i see something up ahead.
speaker3: another time. another night. a younger-looking hallenbeck.

speaker1: is weaving toward hallenbeck. leaving behind his crumpled mercedes. 
speaker2: she got in front of me, man. my car. stupid wrecked my car...
speaker2: do you know who i am...? i'm louis baynard, my father is calvin d. baynard, man. call my father, he'll take care of it.
speaker2: you'll tell 'em what happened, right...? swerved in front of me, man. wrecked my mercedes. right...?
speaker3: i could smell bourbon on him, big time. he was standing there, not a scratch on him. i went a little nuts. i hit him.
speaker3: the blow was non-lethal. but when he fell, his head hit the pavement funny. put him in a coma.

speaker1: even when he came out of it, he was never right in the head. his dad fixed everything with the cops. the accident report disappeared. a week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house. acting on an anonymous tip. 
speaker2: the senator your job.
speaker1: and my pension. and my marriage. only reason i'm still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few calls. since then i'm just playing it out. day by day.
speaker2: cory tumbled to some sort of deal between marcon and the senator, and they had her killed. we gotta show this photo to the cops.
speaker1: not yet. i need more evidence. i want baynard, jimmy. i want to bring him down. i could use your help.
speaker2: why should i help you?
speaker1: because if baynard takes a fall, so does marcon. the man who kicked you out of professional football.

speaker1: i want the sheets changed, milo. 
speaker2: of course you do, but we're running behind, dearest.
speaker1: i don't give a i'm an actress, not a piece of meat, and i want clean sheets!
speaker2: fine. it's done. right after this next shot.
speaker2: okay, let's do it. roll camera.
speaker3: rolling.
speaker2: and... action! the closet door opens. a hulking man emerges. he is carrying a chainsaw. the girl on the bed stares, incredulous.
speaker1: milo... what the is this, some kind of joke?

speaker1: not at all, dearest. it's what's known as a snuff film. 
speaker2: oh milo please oh oh no please miloooo!!
speaker1: easy, pablo. she's not a piece of meat.

speaker1: yes, mr. marcon? how can i help you? 
speaker2: is this line secure?
speaker1: one hundred percent, sir. i wouldn't have used your name otherwise.
speaker2: sid and jake are dead, milo. killed in an explosion. looks like we got a new player in the game.
speaker1: who is he working for?
speaker2: from available information, he appears to be a free agent. guy by the name of joe hallenbeck.

speaker1: yes, sir. and then? 
speaker2: and then you'll be handling it personally.

speaker1: so i get to meet your family, huh? 
speaker2: she's like thirteen. and if you even look at her funny, i'll shove an umbrella up your and open it.

speaker1: first things first. i'm starving. hey, kiddo. why aren't you in bed? 
speaker2: i'm watching television.
speaker1: i can see that.
speaker2: i hate you. leave me alone.

speaker1: she's off because i wouldn't let her go out on a date with her friend billy. 
speaker2: i missed the biggest party of the year.
speaker3: why couldn't she go?
speaker1: because she's thirteen, that's why. i bought you some ice cream.
speaker2: i'm not talking to you.
speaker1: gee, that's a shame. you always have such pleasant things to say. 'i hate you, dad.' i'm gonna miss that, darn it... it's chocolate chip, your favorite.
speaker2: i don't care. you're an
speaker1: that's for saying i hate wasting food. wanna abuse me some more? go ahead, shock me. you know, i hardly ever hear the word
speaker2: bullshit, i bet you get it all the time.
speaker1: all right, knock it off.

speaker1: what're you gonna do, ground me some more? 
speaker2: hey, you want it, you got it, lady.
speaker1: thank you,
speaker2: you're grounded for a week.
speaker1: yes, sir,
speaker2: that's two. you wanna play this game? i love this game.
speaker1: just leave me alone. he thinks he's ward cleaver.
speaker2: all right, that's it. you wanna be a gutter mouth? you wanna sound like your mother, well that's terrific. christ, all day long i don't take enough abuse, i gotta listen to from you!
speaker3: hey, joe, take it easy...
speaker2: don't you tell me how to talk to my kid.
speaker1: all i wanted was to go to a party, but pop here thinks i'm out to get laid.
speaker2: go for it, kiddo. all the dirty words. come on, shock me. go ahead.
speaker1: sure thing, you fuck-up.

speaker1: all right, i've had it. go to your room. or i will whip your behind. 
speaker2: you'd probably like it.
speaker1: goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that? you got it? you don't ever call me a fuck-up.
speaker2: why shouldn't i, mom calls you that all the time.
speaker1: your mother called me a fuck-up...?
speaker2: on the phone to uncle jay.
speaker1: uncle jay? ohh, christ, i'm a fuck-up, but uncle jay, now there's a real stand-up guy. the cheats on his tax form, i'm surprised he hasn't done time! why don't you ask your mother why mister wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion?
speaker2: because he doesn't up. she goes into her room and shuts the door. hallenbeck rubs his eyes. leans against the wall, exhausted.
speaker3: you know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers.

speaker1: no. anything that much fun, i'd want to do myself. 
speaker2: i think we could both use a drink.
speaker2: that's you?
speaker1: yeah. that's me.
speaker2: you look like the dad on 'the brady bunch.'
speaker1: yeah, i was a regular boy scout.
speaker2: so. you gonna get a divorce?
speaker1: don't know.
speaker2: you don't like women much, do you, joe?
speaker1: mike miller wasn't the first time. sarah has cheated on me before. twice. i never told her i knew. at first, my opinion of women took a real dip, yeah.
speaker2: and now?
speaker1: now i'm content if i like the guy she's this last one was my best friend.

speaker1: horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye. 
speaker2: what am i, jimmy?
speaker1: he tried to get you killed.
speaker2: friends can't be perfect. i wish the sky wasn't blue. i wish water wasn't wet. i wish i didn't still love my wife.
speaker1: you know what i did last night?
speaker2: what?
speaker1: i went to a party and on a car.
speaker2: you, too?
speaker1: i'm a complete loser. capital 'l.' all i ever wanted... was to be somebody's hero, you know it...? now i mostly sit around. watch t.v. get laid. i'm a slug, throw salt on me i'd curl up. life
speaker2: you're wrong.
speaker1: life doesn't
speaker2: no, life but you're not a loser. cory loved you.
speaker1: yeah, and the last thing i did was cheat on her. why do people cheat, joe?

speaker1: because it's easier than paying the tax, junior. 
speaker2: ooooooh. very deep.
speaker1: so deep i don't know what the it means.
speaker2: it means another drink is required.
speaker2: alex the accountant.
speaker1: is alex your accountant?
speaker2: no. but he could have been. alex was my son.
speaker2: i was married at 19. sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. i didn't know she was a junkie. all during her pregnancy. shooting up. there were complications. she died. alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. fell asleep. died before he woke up. he was born... he had time for one dream... and then he died. i wonder what his dream was about.
speaker1: i'm sorry.
speaker2: i think about him a lot. i mean, who was this... guy?

speaker1: he would have been a great ball player. like his dad. 
speaker2: no. he had to die, joe. don't you see?
speaker1: why did he have to die?
speaker2: because he came out of me.
speaker2: i'm gonna borrow your shower.

speaker1: joe, man, you don't get it -- 
speaker2: shut up.
speaker2: this is what you went looking for in cory's apartment, isn't it? you found this when you found that envelope.
speaker1: joe, please! joe drops the vial in the water. flushes.
speaker1: you stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? that was a thousand bucks' worth of
speaker2: you got it, son. i'm just mixing it in with all the other get the out of my house. now.
speaker1: you don't understand.
speaker2: i said, get out. i'll break your neck, kiddo.
speaker1: go ahead, tough guy. go ahead. i'm trying to survive, man. i use that stuff to get by, so you.
speaker2: i don't use it. i get by.

speaker1: oh, sure, dudley do-right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? and your kid?? and i said to 'hey, buddy, what gives? i go to church, i give to the united way, what is this dead wife and kid shit...?' and he didn't say nothin', joe. 
speaker1: and then i lose my job, my life, okay, and why...? you know why? because i gambled. whoa, hold on, stop the presses, jimmy gambled, well of course i gambled, everybody does, and the league knows it!
speaker1: why, joe? why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? nobody else has a injury report, but the n.f.l. does, so the gamblers will know the spread! marcon... the commissioner ... those hypocrites... killed the last thing i could do, joe...! i can't do anything... anymore.
speaker1: i couldn't save my wife... she died screaming and i couldn't do a thing... and my baby came out... and he was so small, joe... he was too small... he collapses against the wall.

speaker1: when you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way. 
speaker2: you're a total bastard.
speaker1: you brought cocaine in my house. end of story.
speaker3: you're jimmy dix, aren't you?
speaker2: huh?
speaker3: i'm sorry i acted like a would you sign my card?
speaker1: i told you to go to your room.
speaker3: but, dad -- !
speaker1: go to bed. this guy's not signing anything.
speaker3: aw, come off it.
speaker1: forget it, darian. the guy's a loser. big time.

speaker1: i never shaved points, joe. i never did. 
speaker1: if you want my help, i'm at the casa loma apartments on ventura. he exits. shuts the door behind him.
speaker2: smile, you

speaker1: goddammit, jimmy, i told you -- ! it isn't jimmy. 
speaker2: good morning, joseph. he fires point-blank.

speaker1: slides to the curb in front of him. two men get out: 
speaker2: good morning, jimmy.
speaker3: who are you, and how the do you know my name?
speaker4: this is the guy? you sure it's the guy?
speaker2: this is him.
speaker4: the kid with the million-dollar arm?
speaker2: yeah.
speaker4: he don't look like much. i wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo.
speaker2: neither will anyone else, anymore.
speaker3: i'm growing whiskers here, guys. you got something to say, say it.
speaker4: wow. tough guy stuff. must have caught it from his buddy hallenbeck.

speaker1: who? 
speaker2: don't play shithead. you were with him last night at the club.
speaker3: mr. marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, jimmy. something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his business.
speaker2: get ready, kid. this one's an e ticket.
speaker1: please, guys, don't do this... christ, i was just her boyfriend, i swear to please!

speaker1: oh, my arm, my arm, oh christ!!! 
speaker2: alone in the pit. huddled in a pool of muddy water.
speaker3: gimmee the bad news first. mccaskey bad news is, they just pulled jimmy dix out of a construction site on ventura. he's busted up.
speaker3: okay, now gimme the bad news. mccaskey i just got a call from hallenbeck's neighbor. bessalo looks up, intrigued. mccaskey continues: mccaskey now, according to hallenbeck, mike miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case, right?
speaker3: right.

speaker1: he lied. why did he lie...? 
speaker1: miller was his wife. mccaskey what?
speaker1: that's why the car was there, miller was hallenbeck's wife, hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember? christ, joe wasted the himself!
speaker1: i want an a.p.b. out on joe hallenbeck. now. find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard.
speaker1: i let him go, mick. he wasted mike miller and waltzed right out of my office, i let him go, goddammit! mccaskey relax, ben. we'll bring him in.
speaker1: you wanna bet?

speaker1: weathered. sallow. dark circles under the eyes. 
speaker2: comes into frame and slaps him. hard.

speaker1: i think he's awake. 
speaker2: make sure.
speaker3: i'm awake. his eyelids creak open. he squints, adjusting to the light.
speaker1: you nearly broke my wrist, man.
speaker3: life's a

speaker1: milo warned us to watch out for this guy. chet is seething. he glares at hallenbeck. 
speaker2: that. look at him. he's nothin'. guy's a piece of
speaker3: anybody got a cigarette...?
speaker2: sure, buddy. i got a cigarette.
speaker2: hey, baby, i thought you were tough. see, pablo, he ain't so bad. hallenbeck's eyes glint fiercely. he takes a breath.
speaker3: i seem to have dropped my cigarette. may i have another?
speaker2: sure. sure thing, buddy.

speaker1: i need a light. and if you touch me again... i'll kill you. a pregnant pause. the challenge hangs in the air. slowly, chet takes the lighter from his pocket. pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features. hallenbeck leans forward for a light. chet extends his arm -- and slugs hallenbeck in the face again. rocks him. chet howls with laughter. 
speaker2: baby! two for two! the laughter continues. hallenbeck takes a deep breath. stands up. strikes with a flattened palm. breaks chet's nose. drives it up into the brain. chet stands, pole-axed. blinks once. pitches over dead. and suddenly pablo isn't laughing. he stares at hallenbeck, incredulous.
speaker3: christ. you son-of-a-bitch. he rushes to chet. kneels beside him.
speaker3: you killed him! 'fuckin' a, you killed him, he's dead!!!

speaker1: is there a problem? 
speaker1: oh, my. oh, goddamn. joseph, joseph, you don't disappoint me.
speaker1: you seem to have killed one of my men.
speaker2: i needed a light.
speaker1: you took an awful risk. pablo here could have shot you dead.
speaker2: if you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me.
speaker1: yes, that's true. i suppose introductions are in order.
speaker2: it. you're the bad guy, right?

speaker1: yes. i'm the bad guy. 
speaker2: and you've got the gun, and i'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that?
speaker1: something like that.
speaker2: fine. i'll start trembling in a minute. mind if i have a drink first?
speaker1: i don't see why not. pablo, please take chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix mr. hallenbeck a drink.
speaker3: make that two.
speaker2: hey, look who's here. connie marcon himself.
speaker4: careful, son. only my friends call me connie.
speaker2: you got friends? when did this happen?
speaker4: i'll give you one thing. you're pretty calm for a man in your position.

speaker1: you're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year. 
speaker2: they're having some problems.
speaker1: they stink.
speaker2: i'm glad you're here, joe. we got a few things to discuss.
speaker2: for starters, i'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better. used to be, you went to the local stadium come sunday, you saw heroes. guys who fought for their hometown. anymore, no one gives a ever since sonny werblin paid $400,000 to joe namath back in '66, the sons of just got greedier. playing only for themselves. giving nothing back to the game.
speaker2: this year, the final blow: the n.f.l. votes to decertify the players organization. eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. to greed, you follow?
speaker1: when do i say the pledge of allegiance?

speaker1: do you know how many ratings points monday night football lost this year? per week? an average of two point eight. 
speaker2: oh, for chrissake. you're telling me this whole thing is about tv ratings?
speaker1: people have stopped watching, joe! everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? guys like you. milo here tells me you took a bullet for the president, jumped in front of a sniper rifle.
speaker3: we took the liberty of researching your background.
speaker1: how about it, joe? is it truth or hype?
speaker2: i got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir.
speaker1: there you go, that's what i'm saying. the public wants real heroes. not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers. in fact, joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. can you guess?
speaker2: gambling.

speaker1: exactly. gambling. just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. and that, joe boy, is where i come in. 
speaker2: that's what this is about! you're bribing united states senators. paying them to pass legislation --
speaker1: -- legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. exactly.
speaker2: attendance goes up again. tv ratings go up again.
speaker1: you got it, son. the networks are happy. i'm happy. everybody's happy.
speaker2: before we get too happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, i'm not your son, and second... why am i still alive?
speaker1: it's like this, joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then i hit a snag: senator calvin baynard.
speaker2: i don't get it. what's the snag?
speaker1: i offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it.

speaker1: baynard? are you nuts? the guy's so crooked he slinkies. 
speaker2: allow me to clarify: i offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money.
speaker3: thank for a minute there i felt freezing over. did he ask for more than a million?
speaker2: does the pope in the woods? he wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. i don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die.
speaker3: taking off a u.s. senator, that's pretty ballsy. even for an like you.
speaker2: oh, i'm not going to kill baynard, joe.
speaker3: who is?
speaker3: oh,
speaker3: i'm the perfect fall guy. everyone and his uncle max knows i hate baynard.
speaker2: anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, joe boy. my hands are clean.

speaker1: any particular reason i should go along with this prize-winning scheme? 
speaker2: just one.
speaker2: sit down, joe.
speaker3: do what he says, joe. joe sits. breathing shallowly.
speaker1: are you alright, sarah?
speaker3: yes.
speaker4: that's a temporary condition, joseph. as you may be aware, there are distributors in mexico who positively crave snuff films. and unless you do every thing mr. marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut.

speaker1: look, i'll say it again for the cheap seats: i don't know anything and i can't help you. okay? can i go now? 
speaker2: let me get this straight: you're walking along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason.
speaker1: that's it.
speaker2: you're full of kid. tell me where hallenbeck is.
speaker1: how the should i know? try his house.
speaker2: we did. where is he?
speaker1: for chrissake, i just met the guy. look, sergeant. i don't give a about joe hallenbeck. i just busted my throwing arm and i'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the outta here.

speaker1: get up. 
speaker2: go yourself.
speaker2: i meant that... in a good way...
speaker1: time for a little payback, joe. call it a service to dear departed chet. he slams a fist into hallenbeck's middle.
speaker1: how's that feel, fuckhead?
speaker2: i'm asshole... she's fuckhead. and with that, pablo lets him have it. rains punches on his chest and gut. slams an elbow into his kidneys. drives a knee into his groin. joe hits the deck.
speaker3: easy, pablo. i want him conscious.
speaker4: you, stop it!! oh, leave him alone!

speaker1: don't... look at me... 
speaker2: shhh. it's okay, joe. i'm here, it's okay. i love you, joe.
speaker1: i get the beat out of me... puke all over myself... and now you love me?
speaker2: i never stopped loving you, joe.
speaker1: christ, you slept with three guys.
speaker2: you knew about the others?
speaker1: i knew.
speaker2: you never said anything.
speaker1: figured... you needed them.
speaker2: joe, goddammit, why didn't you say something?
speaker1: like what? 'fuck you, sarah'?
speaker2: yes. you, sarah! anything to show that you... that you had some pride left.

speaker1: sorry... i'm fresh out. 
speaker2: i'm scared, joe. get me out of this.
speaker1: must be my trick ear. sounded like you said, 'get me out of this.'
speaker2: you can take these guys, joe.
speaker1: i've got cracked ribs and a concussion.
speaker2: save me, joe. be a hero.
speaker1: i don't believe in heroes.
speaker2: that's no excuse.
speaker1: you, sarah... and he smiles. just then, milo signals from the boat.
speaker3: all right, lovebirds, break it up. he yanks sarah to her feet.
speaker3: nice

speaker1: stay down, don't you move. 
speaker2: careful, pablo. we don't want to get mrs. hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby.
speaker2: hello, joseph, guess what? time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price.
speaker3: you're gonna kill us both anyway.
speaker2: perhaps. but there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. capisce? you determine your wife's fate. he yanks hallenbeck to his feet. propels him toward the boat.
speaker4: joe...!

speaker1: i'll be back. that's a promise. 
speaker2: you're wasting my time, joseph. let's go.
speaker1: if you touch me again... i'll kill you. they stare into each other's eyes. hallenbeck does not give an inch.

speaker1: i need to borrow a gun, henry. 
speaker2: marcon.

speaker1: it's milo, sir. we're now underway and should be lying off catalina within two hours. 
speaker2: good boy, milo. the commissioner's party starts at six. i'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty.
speaker1: very good, sir.
speaker2: any problems with hallenbeck?
speaker1: no, we're getting along famously.
speaker2: glad to hear it. no fuckups, milo.
speaker1: i assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise.
speaker2: christ, milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit?
speaker1: if it annoys you, i could always adopt a texas drawl, though i'm afraid i don't know any stories about pigs. sir.
speaker2: cows, milo. never pigs.
speaker1: i'll remember that, sir. he hangs up.
speaker2: fruitcake.

speaker1: so far, so good. 
speaker2: we've worked too hard, con.
speaker1: take it easy, buddy. we're covered.
speaker2: you're using the first team, yes?
speaker1: absolutely. actually, i have no choice.
speaker2: how's that?
speaker1: hallenbeck killed the second and third teams.
speaker3: what do you need a boat for?
speaker4: i'm gonna crash a party out on catalina. marcon will be there.
speaker3: maybe... we should call the police.

speaker1: no, honey. not now. there's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. if i blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. i'm sorry, darian. 
speaker2: so... what do we do...?
speaker1: what i do... is confront conrad marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back.
speaker2: is that gonna work?
speaker1: beats me, but i think it's what your dad would do.
speaker2: i'm scared.
speaker1: me, too, honey.
speaker1: so... why'd you come to me, anyhow?
speaker2: i don't know. i thought you'd... know what happened, know what to do... i mean, you were one of my dad's big heroes.
speaker1: what?

speaker1: when i was little, he used to talk about you all the time. best football player in the game. great this. wonderful that. you shoulda seen him when you got busted. 
speaker2: i'll get them back, kiddo. i'll get them back.

speaker1: as a thirty-shot clip is snapped into place. 
speaker2: your wife's very pretty.
speaker3: you,
speaker2: my, my. little testy this evening.
speaker2: that's not very polite, you know, calling someone a a lot of hard ks. very abusive sounding.
speaker2: what would you do, joseph, if someone called you that? would you cut out one of his eyes...?
speaker3: nope.
speaker2: what would you do?

speaker1: i'd go off and some and leave him the alone. 
speaker2: it occurs to me, joseph, that i would very much like to hear you scream.
speaker1: come again?
speaker2: you're so cool, aren't you? so... if you'll pardon the expression... hard-boiled. i'd like, just once, to hear you scream in pain.
speaker1: play some rap music.
speaker2: fascinating.
speaker1: when do i kill baynard?
speaker2: come now, joseph, did you really think that i'd hand you a loaded gun? you're not really going to kill anyone.
speaker1: i'm not?
speaker2: no.
speaker2: you're going to be framed for the senator's murder... when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime.

speaker1: nice tux. he turns, and sees darian hallenbeck. 
speaker2: goddammit, i told you to go home!
speaker1: you, i stowed away. they're my parents, okay?
speaker2: fine, whatever. just stay here.

speaker1: anything funny happens, get the out of here. 
speaker2: you look terrible.
speaker1: i feel terrible.
speaker2: are you really a drug addict?
speaker1: i was. i kicked the habit.
speaker2: when?
speaker1: this morning. stay here.
speaker2: don't let them break your other arm.
speaker1: thanks, kid. you're a inspiration.
speaker3: at eight-fifteen, senator baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. he and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea.
speaker4: he thinks he's geting his two-million-dollar payoff.

speaker1: then we pull a simple switch. when the man returns to his boat, he's carrying this suitcase. 
speaker2: plastics?
speaker1: detonation upon opening. enough to kill the passengers, not enough to sink the craft. and when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable conclusion: a down-on-his-luck p.i. makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a career.
speaker2: that sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred?
speaker1: maybe i'll get to hear you scream, after all...
speaker3: you better get up here, we got a problem.

speaker1: hey! buddy, i got a cracked engine casing, i'm dead in the water! can i get a tow? 
speaker2: i'm sorry, sir. this boat is island security, we're under strict orders to stay within this sector.
speaker1: aw, look, it'll take ten minutes!
speaker2: i'm sorry, we can't help you.
speaker1: goddammit, now i gotta call the coast guard!
speaker3: milo, he's gonna bring the coast guard down on top of us.
speaker2: excuse me. sir?
speaker2: you, sir.

speaker1: the entire family is blown away. 
speaker2: the bodies topple like broken toys.
speaker3: problem solved. get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen.

speaker1: christ, i can't believe i agreed to this dog and pony show. let's get it over with. the head for the boats. jimmy stares after them, mind racing. makes a decision: heads for the boats. 
speaker2: jimmy casts off the lines.
speaker3: gimmee the keys, kiddo.
speaker4: where are you going?

speaker1: the senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. i'm gonna follow him. 
speaker1: get off the boat.
speaker2: you, man. no way.
speaker1: darian, goddammit -- she runs below decks.
speaker2: i'm not coming out! jimmy looks up:
speaker1: okay. okay. easy. he throttles forward.

speaker1: this is air one, over. 
speaker2: roger, air one, over.

speaker1: goddammit, i lost him. i can't see a thing. 
speaker2: see if this boat has sonar.
speaker1: oh, yeah, little miss know-it-all.

speaker1: you. 
speaker2: watch your mouth.
speaker1: take a bath in my ass.

speaker1: okay. we're cool. 
speaker2: hey! any of you stupid bother to frisk this goombah?
speaker3: no, sir, we didn't think --
speaker2: exactly, you didn't think! goddammit, that's two million bucks there, now frisk the guy!
speaker1: hey, baby, i'm clean, take it easy --
speaker2: easy. against the wall, spread 'em!

speaker1: okay? satisfied? 
speaker2: we're cool, baby.

speaker1: all we're doing is burning gas. sorry, kid, i'm turning back. 
speaker2: do you hear that -- ?
speaker3: bursts from the fog. directly in front of them.
speaker1: holy rotor wash sprays in every direction.
speaker4: code yellow, code yellow, we got a bogie, repeat, we got a bogie, over.
speaker5: air one, air one, where the is he?
speaker4: nine o'clock, repeat, on your nine, and closing fast!

speaker1: something's going on. 
speaker2: what is it?
speaker1: another boat. it's a setup!
speaker2: get us out of here, now!

speaker1: the crewman lowers the binoculars in disbelief: 
speaker2: son of a it's dix, the quarterback!

speaker1: air one, air one, follow the senator, roger? i'll take the sport boat, you take baynard, over. 
speaker2: that's a roger. over and out.
speaker1: okay, let's go. full throttle.

speaker1: daddy!! 
speaker2: i don't believe it.
speaker1: do something! hurry!

speaker1: keep the wheel like this! don't let it move! 
speaker1: third and long, baby, lets' go...

speaker1: what the hell's she doing here?? 
speaker2: i stowed away... gunfire splits the air.

speaker1: hallenbeck staggers to his feet. 
speaker2: get below, darian. and stay there.
speaker3: got any ideas?
speaker2: yeah. go really fast and hope they don't catch us. oh,
speaker3: what?
speaker2: fog bank, dead ahead. hang on. into the fog they go, and, folks -- this is really scary.

speaker1: we're dead. except, just then, a strange thing happens: milo's yacht veers off to the left. away from hallenbeck. jimmy stares, dumbfounded. 
speaker2: what the they're peeling off. why?
speaker1: 'cause they got sonar, that's why!
speaker2: port?
speaker1: left, goddammit.
speaker2: piss! they almost make it.

speaker1: we're on half power, we lost an engine! 
speaker1: swears again. bangs his fist.
speaker1: we're sitting ducks. they got sonar. they can find us.
speaker2: kill the running lights and radio the coast guard.
speaker1: me.
speaker2: get down!

speaker1: what's that? 
speaker2: that's baynard's boat!
speaker1: it can get us to shore faster than this one, don't you think? he starts to turn away. notices something in the water. speaks over his shoulder to jimmy.
speaker1: hand me the pole.
speaker2: what is it?
speaker1: birthday present.

speaker1: listen carefully. i'm gonna go get your mom back, okay? you're gonna go in the denny's restaurant and stay there. talk to the waitress but don't mention me. mom and i will come pick you up later, got it? 
speaker2: they're gonna kill you...!
speaker1: are you kidding? i do this for a living. buy me an ice cream. i'll be back. i love you.

speaker1: your prints are all over that boat. what happens when they find the bodies inside? 
speaker2: quit being a killjoy.
speaker2: come on. we've got some things to pick up.

speaker1: someone's staking me out. 
speaker2: oh, i forgot to tell you. the police want you for killing mike miller.

speaker1: i think i got someone! four o'clock! 
speaker2: is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage.

speaker1: let's get him inside and tie him up. 
speaker2: are you crazy? that's a cop! you don't punch cops!
speaker1: i forgot. hurry up.

speaker1: wear that. 
speaker1: you know how to use a gun?
speaker2: the trigger's the little black thing.
speaker1: here.

speaker1: use these. they're shredders. equipped with an explosive charge. when you fire the gun, they spray on impact. take out anything within ten yards. 
speaker2: what are you gonna use?
speaker1: a little souvenir...
speaker1: go bring the car around.
speaker3: parked at the curb.
speaker4: he starts to cry out -- and a dark figure looms behind him.

speaker1: as they're placed in front of hallenbeck. 
speaker2: are you a literate man, joe?
speaker3: i got a subscription to jugs magazine.
speaker2: that's good. see, joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story.
speaker4: we've got jimmy dix in the trunk.
speaker2: get him out of here. take him to mr. marcon. i'll follow you as soon as my business here is finished.
speaker2: yeah, you're gonna write a little story, joe. about how guilt- stricken you are over senator baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. yeah... you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself.
speaker3: hey, who's writing this story?
speaker2: oh, and, joe...? don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered.
speaker3: what cop?

speaker1: that one. 
speaker2: you son of a bitch...!
speaker2: we don't like pablo very much, do we, furry tom...?
speaker1: is he doing that?
speaker2: furry tom, tell pablo what i'm gonna do to him.
speaker2: you're gong to make pablo eat all his teeth, mr. hallenbeck.

speaker1: that's amazing, man! 
speaker2: hey, mr. hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. that's not very nice.
speaker2: are you mad, furry tom?

speaker1: you know i don't enjoy doin' this, jim. 
speaker1: i remember how much you hated the pain... you got hooked on demerol, didn't you...? i'll make a deal with you. tell me who you talked to, and i'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow.
speaker2: nobody knows. just... just me...
speaker1: now, see, i'd love to believe you. but we are talking about the future of my football team.

speaker1: and ain't nothin' more important than my ball club, 'cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs. got one of yours, you know. who'd you talk to, jimmy? 
speaker2: nobody... marcon raises the poker.

speaker1: he's nothing, he can't hurt us. 
speaker2: yes, sir.
speaker3: steps through the french doors behind him.
speaker4: don't.
speaker4: the gun is silenced, i'll kill you. where's my wife?
speaker1: i... i don't remember, i... joe shoves on the gun. the barrel chokes him.
speaker4: my wife.
speaker4: the address. now!
speaker1: it's... milo's film studio...
speaker4: write it down, dumbfuck.

speaker1: jimmy, you okay...? 
speaker2: hurts like hell.
speaker1: okay, connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it? can you walk, jimmy?
speaker2: yeah... i think so -- joe, behind you...!
speaker3: drop it. it's the same odd voice we heard earlier.
speaker1: you drop it, asshole, or i kill marcon.
speaker3: sorry, but that won't work. i don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun.
speaker3: walk over there by your friend, joe.

speaker1: well, goddamn. how's the head, lou? 
speaker2: aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely.
speaker1: next time, lou, just say no.
speaker3: this is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face!
speaker4: you son of a you were gonna let him kill me!
speaker2: nothing more or less than you'd do for me, conrad. i never thought i'd see you again, joe.
speaker1: speaking of which, what the are you doing here?
speaker2: call it a financial partnership. for a price, i agreed to connect mr. marcon to the necessary people in washington.
speaker1: in other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times.

speaker1: but imagine my delight this morning, joe, when mr. marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime... what can i say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist? 
speaker2: do i also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess?
speaker1: it was i, unfortunately, who bought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne... spoke a little too freely to that hooker.
speaker3: she wasn't a hooker,
speaker2: he should know, jimmy. with a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it.
speaker1: you can die fast or slow, so watch your mouth.
speaker3: we'd rather watch yours. it's goofy-lookin'.
speaker4: kill them, goddammit, waste 'em both!
speaker3: any bright ideas, joe?
speaker2: gimmee a minute.
speaker3: excuse me, could you give him a minute? he's trying to think of a way out of this.

speaker1: you know of course, connie, that you're a dead man. 
speaker2: wait.
speaker2: let's humor this what are you talking about?
speaker1: nothing much, just that i made a phone call from the boat on the way in.
speaker2: you called the cops? it, they can't prove a thing.
speaker1: oh, but i didn't call the cops. i called the mob.
speaker1: see, connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. if you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government. i wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you. of course, i might be able to call it off.

speaker1: he's bluffing. he's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. nice try, kill them. 
speaker2: then there's the matter of two million dollars. or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...?
speaker2: i've got your money, connie. stashed in the back of a rented subaru. we'll take you to it.
speaker1: i don't believe it. this guy's a riot.
speaker3: i don't think it's working, joe.
speaker2: hell, i'm fresh out. you wanna try one, kid, go for it.
speaker3: you, joe, i'm not just gonna stand here and die. mr. marcon, he's lying. we do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. i have the key on me. i'l hand it over if you let me go. hallenbeck stares in disbelief.
speaker1: where is the key, jimmy?

speaker1: it's stashed in my shorts. 
speaker2: all right. slow and easy.
speaker1: sure. slow and easy.
speaker1: promise you'll let me go.
speaker2: with that, son. hand it over or i'll have you kneecapped.
speaker1: oh, yeah? well, that's too bad. see, it's one of those new plastic keys. the kind that melt...? and, with that, he hurls it into the fire.
speaker1: i guess nobody gets the money.
speaker2: pull it out of there! one of them grabs a pair of tongs -- and the shredder explodes. sprays the two hardguys. cuts them to ribbons. then, several things happen at once: everybody goes for a gun. hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol -- as marcon draws his gun and fires, missing -- joe returns fire, bam-bam -- !

speaker1: plastic keys...? the kind that melt? 
speaker2: hey. short notice, best i could do.
speaker1: you did fine, junior.
speaker2: learned it from a pro. come on.

speaker1: son of a 
speaker2: forget about him. let's get my wife.

speaker1: i'm new at this, joe. how do we do it? 
speaker2: we get in, we get out. shoot anyone who's not my wife. check that: don't shoot me.

speaker1: lights. camera. the wrong kind of action. 
speaker2: on a bed, naked.
speaker3: with a chainsaw. and he's standing right over her. jimmy blows down the two artistes.
speaker4: cut.

speaker1: drive one of their cars. they won't be needing them. 
speaker2: where do you want me to go?
speaker1: the two million bucks is still in the subaru. parked on mulholland above marcon's house. go pick it up and bring it to the office.
speaker2: yes, massah. he moves off into the parking lot.
speaker1: i'll take you and darian to the office. you can sleep there.
speaker3: why can't we go home?
speaker1: there's four corpses in the bedroom.
speaker3: oh.

speaker1: jimmy should be here any minute. then we gotta talk to the cops. 
speaker2: will the police catch marcon?
speaker1: maybe. he's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave town.
speaker2: i remember when we got married... my friends would talk about their husbands. they'd say, 'oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'my husband is a brilliant lawyer...' i used to say, 'my husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.'
speaker1: don't knock it. it's a skill.
speaker2: i want to try, joe. do you still want to try?
speaker1: ahh, looks like the local constable has come to chat.
speaker2: shall we invite him in?
speaker1: no. stay here. i'll deal with it.

speaker1: advances. changing clips. methodical. precise. like a robot. 
speaker1: you up my face, joseph!
speaker1: don't try to hide, joseph. i've got all night, you up my face.
speaker2: huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward. through the wooden frame. a hot slug rips through joe's arm. an eruption of blood. he hisses in pain. rolls away from the gunfire. looks around. desperate. sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. he counts to three.
speaker3: milo calmly changes clips. hallenbeck bursts from cover.

speaker1: you just die. 
speaker2: she's something, isn't she?

speaker1: stares, dumbfounded at sarah. she look up at him. a moment passes between them. around hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. horns blaring. amidst it all, he stands. beaten. bloody. bullet-scarred. jimmy winds his way through the cars. walks up to joe. they stand in silence for a moment, then jimmy says: 
speaker2: the car's over on the other side. c'mere, i want to show you something.

speaker1: somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat. had to be marcon, right? 
speaker1: son of a got the wrong one!

speaker1: you got a lot of questions to answer. 
speaker2: i know.
speaker1: you'll probably lose your license.
speaker2: i know.
speaker1: do you care?
speaker2: my wife loves me.

speaker1: so. 
speaker2: yeah. so.
speaker1: you gonna keep it?
speaker2: some of it.

speaker1: how much? 
speaker2: my fee. he shuts the case. shoves it toward jimmy.
speaker1: joe... i got all the money i need.
speaker2: i'm thinkin' i could use a partner. think you could handle that for awhile?
speaker1: i maybe could handle that. for awhile.
speaker1: alex the detective.

speaker1: see, jim, the thing is, life but you still can't be hangin' around satan claus, you know why...? 
speaker2: why?
speaker1: 'cause someday, compadre... satan claus and santa claus are gonna have a big fight, and you know what...? santa's gonna kick some royal ass.
speaker1: hey. smile, you
