speaker1: i mean, i was surprised when he didn't turn up for work. he was always on time.
speaker2: did you work with him, keith?
speaker1: at the half moon.
speaker3: it's a funny thing. you know a bloke for six years and all the time he's as calm as gentle jesus... ...then he goes and does a thing like that. it's a funny thing.

speaker2: what? you mean, like, kill himself? eddie and keith look at each other.
speaker2: naw. frank? kill himself? you what?
speaker2: i mean, what for?
speaker3: that's what i was wondering.
speaker2: come off it. frank was... well... straight. he had no worries i know. hell, we worked together every day for a year. it would have showed.
speaker3: why would it?
speaker2: it just would. he was always the same.
speaker3: since when did he drink whisky?
speaker2: don't know.
speaker3: nobody seems to know.
speaker1: good bloke. one of the best.
speaker4: how would you know? or you? or you? none of you knew. i knew. he was me dad.

speaker4: we've got to take you back to london.
speaker3: he said it'd be doing him a big favour.
speaker3: we know why you're all steamed up, and so do gerald and sid.

speaker2: stuff it! my girl friend's coming from liverpool tonight. nice surprise, isn't it?
speaker1: i'm sorry. here. this'll pay for a course in karate.
speaker2: frank said you were a and he was well right.
speaker2: you even screwed his wife, didn't you?
speaker2: the poor didn't even know if the kid was his.

speaker1: how were things between you and frank? 
speaker2: he was all right to me.
speaker1: nothing more? just another feller?
speaker2: nicer than most.
speaker1: but he was just another feller, wasn't he?
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: though nicer than most?
speaker2: yes. i can't help the way i am.
speaker1: why'd you see him so regular?
speaker2: once a week?
speaker1: i call that regular.
speaker2: he was gentlemanly. i like that.
speaker1: once a week you like a gentleman?
speaker2: look, i'm me, right. you're not. we are what we are, like it or not. why all the needle?
speaker1: what was bugging frank?
speaker2: he wanted me to leave dave and marry him. last friday i told him it wouldn't work. dave would have killed us both! he followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, i had to tell frank i couldn't see him any more. it was getting too dodgy. that was on sunday. he said he'd kill himself. i was frightened what you might do.
speaker1: i don't believe you, margaret. frank wasn't like that. i'm the villain in the family, remember?
speaker2: it's the truth.
speaker2: it is. honestly.
speaker1: you whore. frank was too careful to die like that. who killed him?
speaker2: i don't know nothing.
speaker1: listen, the only reason i came back to this craphole was to find out who did it. and i won't leave until i do. you understand?
speaker3: hello, jack.
speaker1: you it was you who told them i was here, wasn't it?
speaker3: peter's very upset about his car. he's going to all over you.
speaker1: i'll catch up with you later, margaret.
speaker4: come on, get in.

speaker1: you didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you? 
speaker2: no. i didn't know that.
speaker1: a fairy godmother, all of your own. aren't you lucky?
speaker2: so where are we going, princess?
speaker1: to the demon king's castle, of course.
speaker2: of course. where else?

speaker1: how'd you know where i'd be? 
speaker2: you were seen parking your car. the demon king waves his wand and i was dispatched to bring you to him. lucky for you i waited.
speaker1: very lucky, i should think. you're drunk!
speaker2: nasty.
speaker1: he must have been pretty sure i'd come.
speaker2: oh, he was. he told me a magic spell that would make you come.
speaker1: and what was that?
speaker2: we're there now.

speaker1: a new venture of mine. it's going to be a restaurant. do you like it? 
speaker2: yes.
speaker1: last night, after you'd gone, i did a little bit of asking around. seeing as you weren't very forthcoming, it seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother? i got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke i wanted off my back, you know my life. machines. the arcades. nice business. looks after itself. people put money in. i take it out. not much rough stuff. it's a business that makes me very happy. but recently, i've had a spot of bother, one of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. the upshot is i've had to eat and stop flogging my machines to other clubs. so far as i'm concerned, that's it. apparently not. these people i've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit, so i'm worried. i can't fight them â— i haven't that kind of set-up. but i've got to fix them before they fix me. trouble is, if i try and they find out, i'm dead.

speaker2: that's not good enough.
speaker1: christ, what...

speaker1: and you told brumby?
speaker1: who killed frank?
speaker1: do you want to be dead, albert?
speaker2: last sunday afternoon, eric and two of his boys arrive with frank and tell me that he's rumbled. somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. they ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat. i thought they'd just duff him up a bit. honest.
speaker1: what did you do? albert?
speaker2: nothing. what could i do?
speaker1: did eric know that frank was my brother?
speaker2: yes. i told him.
speaker1: what did he say?
speaker2: 'good.' albert draws deeply on his cigarette.
speaker1: is that all there is?
speaker1: then that's it, albert.
speaker2: jack, for christ's sake ...
speaker1: you knew what i'd do.
speaker2: yes, but listen. christ, i didn't kill him.
speaker1: i know you didn't kill him. i know you didn't.

speaker1: no shooters. cyril said no shooters, you stupid bastard. 
speaker2: get stuffed. he's reloading.

speaker4: are you coming in? or do we about all day?
speaker1: you're finished, jack. you know that, don't you? i've finished you.
speaker4: not till i'm dead, eric.
speaker1: oh, you've still got your sense of humour? tell him how i've fixed him, con.
speaker3: he's told gerald about you and anna.
speaker1: didn't believe us at first, did he, con? then peter talked to him.
speaker2: didn't even say goodbye. just asked us to take you back - alive.
speaker1: he's probably talking to her right now. are you still going to fancy her when gerald's finished with her face?
speaker4: stay where you are, peter.
speaker2: don't.
speaker1: carter, your car needs a wash.

speaker1: i don't want them cooking in here. you can put a hatch in that wall. 
speaker2: yes, it's all a question of ...
speaker1: who in christ's name is that? it's a madman.

speaker1: jack! 
speaker2: you shouldn't have shown the film to frank.
speaker1: i had to. it was the only way i could get at them.

speaker1: they don't know how it happened. 
speaker2: how far did he fall?
speaker1: what did betty say... ninety floors, i think it was.
speaker2: really. was he dead?
speaker1: oh, yes.
speaker2: better to go quick like that.

speaker1: gerald fletcher wants a word with you cyril. 
speaker2: hello, gerald.

speaker1: it's carter. listen carefully, you hairy-faced git. i've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time. all it takes is one call to the police. 
speaker2: really? so?
speaker1: i'll do a simple deal with you. all i want is ...

speaker1: i see. i think that can be arranged. 
speaker2: ... but i don't want him there until six in the morning. ok? right.

speaker1: drink up, eric. drink up. i want you to drink all of that. do you understand? drink up. just like it was with my brother, frank. go on, son. drink up.
speaker1: drink up, eric.
speaker1: it was you who poured it down him. eh, eric?
speaker1: did you all have a good laugh, eh? did you have a good laugh when he was spewing it up? the whisky is pouring all over eric's face and suit.
speaker1: drink it! drink it! did you all pass the bottle round after the car went over the top?
speaker1: don't stop, eric.
speaker1: goodbye, eric.
